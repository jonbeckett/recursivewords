I have finally joined the "modern age" of mobile telephony, after purchasing a Sony Ericsson K800i this morning, and signing up for a contract with T-Mobile. For the last few years I have had a pay-as-you-go contract with Orange and a jurassic Nokia 6310i. The one good thing about the Nokia was that it lasted over a week on a charge, and (yes, this is two things) it could connect to the internet through GPRS.

The new phone is ridiculously powerful. It has a 3.2 megapixel camera on it. That's better than my old digital camera. It also has every gadget you could think of on it - so I am hoping it can replace my phone, palm organiser, and camera all in one go. This means less to carry around with me, which is a good thing.

The main reason for signing up to a contract once more is to get the data connection from the phone. I chose T-Mobile because for a small amount on top of my contract each month I can have unlimited internet access through the phone - meaning in turn that I can connect my MacBook to the phone, and connect through 3G to the internet. I can use the internet wherever I am. On the train. On-site in London. Any time. Any place. Freedom!

It means I can leave Adium running on the MacBook during the day, and talk to friends when they pop up. I can actually send those early morning emails that some of you get from me when I write them, instead of them sitting in the computer until I arrive home.

Apparently I can also get the phone to hook up with iSync on the Mac to update the address book, calendar and so on to match the Mac... when it's charged up I'll let you know how that goes.

I bought a 1 gig card for the phone to store photos on. Expect LOTS of blog posts with photos in the near future. Here's the first to be going on with (can you believe this came from a mobile?)...

I have also synced the mobile with the MacBook, so I have the same addresses, calendar and so on in both the MacBook and the phone... I can't believe this all works so well.

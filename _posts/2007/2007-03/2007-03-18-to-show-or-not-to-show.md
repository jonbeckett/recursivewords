Simple question. What works for you? Seeing more, or seeing less?

Yes, I am talking about us. Humans. I hesitate to say "the opposite sex", because that would exclude those who are interested in their own sex - and having known several amazing people who were "that way inclined", I'm keeping this general.

Perhaps we're really talking about a difference between the male and female mind.

You might be interested in a little aside here - a study was done recently by firing a lazer into test subject's eyes, and analysing the target of their sight when presented with various pictures - men, women, and even animals.

The findings were completely unexpected. Girls focussed on the face, and the face alone, whereas men focussed primarily on the... wait for it... on the crotch. Even of animals.

I've always been interested in the human mind - in our perception of the way it works. Why does the male mind seem to concentrate on the physical, and the female mind on the emotional?

What turns your head - unclothed, partially clothed, or covered? Why do you think that is? Do you conform to the stereotype?

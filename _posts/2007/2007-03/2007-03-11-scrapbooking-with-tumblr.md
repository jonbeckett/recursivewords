This is rare. I am going to cross-post between PluggedOut and Life and Times. There's a good reason though - this morning I have been looking at Tumblr.

If you sometimes think writing a blog post is a bit too much, and you wish you just had some kind of online scrapbook, then Tumblr might be just what you are looking for.

It provides easy means of posting thoughts, quotes, links, conversations, photos and videos. There is no way of commenting, so it really is just a splurge of the things you want others to know about - with no real impetus to write acres of body about them inviting comment. It's an online scrapbook. Interestingly, you can also aggregate RSS feeds into your tumblr (a feature that far too few services provide) - meaning you can suck your normal blog into the tumblr too.

If you hadn't guessed, I think it's great. It means you can save your blog for the really big thoughts and stories, and use Tumblr for the minutiae. Used in conjunction with Twitter, it provides a much more immediate feed of our lives than a traditional blog might.

Head on over to www.tumblr.com and check it out for yourself - you might also like to check out my tumblr page - jonbeckett73@tumblr.

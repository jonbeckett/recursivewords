I just want to flag this up for anybody who happens to read this blog. If you are looking at ways of stopping spam on your blog, do not use IP address blocking. The major culprit for this is the Spamhaus service (who I am not going to gratify with a link).

I have just tried to comment on a good friend's blog while connected to the internet via my mobile phone, and I'm being told that my computer is very probably full of malware and spam bots, and I should install the Google Pack.

I am of course about to send an email to Spamhaus asking them if they have ever heard of dynamic IP addresses?. It would appear the idiots who do create spambots have spoofed the same IP range as my mobile phone company. Great.

Blocking specific IP addresses is incredibly short sighted. Askimet doesn't do it - it looks at the sender, email address, URL and body text to make it's decision. It's also very, very accurate.

Anyway. I'll calm down now.

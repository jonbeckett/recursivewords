I am busy building a line of sandbags to hide behind in response to the title of this post. It all dawned on me while walking back towards the office from Pret a Manger at lunchtime.

I was wandering along, daydreaming, and noticed a pretty girl walking the other way. Then a group of unfeasibly model-looking girls turned the corner ahead of me, and bore down upon me in the intimmidating manner that only attractive women can.

For the next few minutes as I wended my way through the lunchtime crowds, I took notice of the girls around me - and they were all pretty. I'm not being judgemental (or at least I don't think I am) - I'm just stating a fact.

The ladies who regularly read my blog are probably drawing their crossbows as I type. I'll be lucky to make it to the end of this paragraph.

What does my lunchtime realisation mean in the wider scheme of things? I have some suspicions;

Perhaps I am turning into an old letch?

I guess this is possible, but highly improbable. Most of my friends are women (which is strange, come to think of it), and I'm pretty sure I don't spend all day thinking about their various attributes (sorry if you thought I did).

Hiring departments in the city are prejudiced?

This is far more probable. Having the cynical view of the world that I do, I would not be at all surprised to find that attractive women land the jobs in London. The evidence of it is walking around on the pavements of the city. Swishy blond career girls with sharp suits, and impossibly perfact makeup. They are everywhere. I would like to think they are vaccuous, but they are probably really nice, and if this situation does exist it's the fault of the people at the top of the big companies...

Am I just noticing the pretty girls?

Perhaps I am conforming to the male stereotype, and subconsciously sorting the crowd in my mind - concentrating my gaze on those that I unwittingly find attractive. How shallow would that make me? (I'm almost shocked at the thought)

Which do you think is true? Do you have another theory? Have you noticed anything similar in other walks of life?

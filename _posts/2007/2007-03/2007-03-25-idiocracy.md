After hearing about it on the MacBreak podcast a couple of weeks ago, I have aquired a copy of the movie "Idiocracy". It's one of the funniest movies I have ever seen...

Imagine a future world where intelligent people have died out - becuase they delayed having a family due to their career, and various factors such as stress contributed to a low sperm count - and their eventual demise.

Now imagine that a military experiment goes wrong, and two people frozen in cryogenic storage wake up 500 years later to discover a very, very different world.

If you're anything like me, you're thinking "this is a remake of Sleeper - the Woody Allen movie", and to a certain extent you are right - but it's so much more. Idiocracy is a damning view of consumer society and a hellish vision of a possible future. While it is incredibly funny, the fact that we find it so funny is in itself disturbing.

I urge you to get hold of a copy of Idiocracy if you have not seen it already, and watch it. When it was released at the cinema it wasn't backed by the studio - probably because they were worried about offending the very people the movie's jokes are targeted at. Ordinary people. People on welfare. People who are not going to be lawyers, accountants, judges, and scientists.

Idiocracy is at turns funny, thought provoking, and disturbing. Everything a great movie should be.

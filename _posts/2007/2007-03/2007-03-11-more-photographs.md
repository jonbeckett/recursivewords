Okay - after finally scraping myself out of bed at about 8:30, and watching rubbish television for an hour I finally had a shower, got dressed, cleaned the kitchen up, and then set about trying the new camera phone (okay, okay, playing with it...).

Here's the first results - click on any of the pics to see them in Flickr.

Happy birthday to me, happy birthday to me, happy birthday dear Jonathan, happy birthday to me. In continuation of my immersion into the "Apple Lifestyle", W got me an iPod Shuffle, which I am trying not to be too smug about.

I thought it might be fitting to re-post the research I did on 1973 when I wrote about it last year

 1. The world was a very different place in 1973. Ted Heath was the Prime     Minister of the UK. Nixon was still president of the USA, who were pulling     out of Vietnam. Elvis played to a billion people via satellite television     from Hawaii. The Russian "konkordski" (the Tupelov Tu144) crashed at the     Paris Air Show. Billie Jean King ruled womens Tennis. Princess Anne married     Captain Mark Phillips. Gerald Ford became the new President of the USA in     November. J.

R.

R. Tolkein died. Olivia Newton John had an international number one with "Take Me Home, Country Roads". TCP/IP was inventedalthough it would not be used for what became the internet for another 10 years. George Lucas released "American Graffiti". Bruce Lee starred in "Enter the Dragon".

There has been a wonderful series on the BBC recently called "Life on Mars"about a police detective in a coma who finds himself in 1973, where the world may as well be Mars. A world where women are subordinate despite the sexual revolution, where ambulance crews are not yet paramedics, where the police fight fire with fire, where furry dice are cool, flares and cuban heals make girls head's turn, and nylon shirts, denim jackets, and kipper ties rule.

It's worth pointing out that they are re-making Life on Mars for the american marketwe're just hoping it will be half as good as the british versionwhich has been the best drama on the telly for years.

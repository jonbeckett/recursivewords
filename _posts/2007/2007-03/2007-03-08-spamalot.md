Last night W came to meet me in London and we travelled to the west end to see Spamalot - the Monty Python musical. Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.

I laughed so much my face hurt at the end. I'm not really sure how they managed to fit so many Monty Python jokes into a couple of hours - and still have it all make sense. It was very much an ensemble piece, but we thought Arthur, the Lady of the Lake, Lancelot, and Patsy (don't ask) stole the show.

We came away in the small hours through the lights of the theatre district, with "I'm not dead yet" t-shirts, wonderful memories, toothy grins, and killer rabbit slippers.

Wonderful production. Wonderful cast. Wonderful evening.

p.s. Hannah Waddingham really was amazing as the Lady of the Lake. Just thought I ought to say that. Not that I have just been looking on YouTube for a clip featuring her or anything...

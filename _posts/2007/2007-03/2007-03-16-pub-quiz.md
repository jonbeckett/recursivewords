Apologies for such a late (and brief) posting. We just got back from the local pub quiz. We came joint first, and won nothing because the pub have a policy of rolling over the winnings when there is no clear winner.

It's the first time we have been anywhere near winning it - indeed, W and our friend Emma were contemplating various violent acts against the pub all the way home. To be fair, we only approached a good score because they knew all but one of the Mr Men pictures in the picture round. They even knew the stories for each Mr Man...

So there you go. It's very late. I need sleep. I shall write more soon.

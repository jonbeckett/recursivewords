Those who read my blog regularly will know that I recently posted the start of a series entitled "A Day In My Life", which described my typical morning routine in a rather literary light.

I had forgotten all about the post, or what I had written until an email arrived this morning from "King of Shaves" - the company that makes the shaving gel I have been using for the last few months. In a fit of philanthropy they offered to send me samples of their other products, which of course I graciously accepted (clung on to with white knuckles is probably closer to the truth).

Those who I have let know so far have suggested all kinds of blags - some of them are even contemplating starting their own blogs in order to review things they want in the hope that the companies involved will stumble upon them and shower them in freebies. Somehow I don't think it's going to happen.

Although I had seen the "King of Shaves" products in supermarkets in the UK for the last couple of years, I had never really looked at them - W continually fights me when buying consumable items; I am the person that picks up whatever is nearest, rather than the best tool for the job. I am learning as I get older - as evidenced by the MacBook, and as I shall explain, the shaving gel.

I really found out about "King of Shaves" while flying home from holiday a year or so ago. There was an in-flight magazine with an article interviewing Will King - the founder of the company. It was an entertaining piece, and filled you with entrepreneurial spirit - the story of the company proves that a one-man-band really can make it big. As far as I recall, the article told the story of Will being as fed up as I typically have been with ripping his face to shreds every time he had a shave - and his quest to find a solution. I remembered this while wandering around the supermarket one day, and was shocked and surprised at the results of my impulse purchase.

For once, something actually worked as well as it claimed to. I haven't shouted it from the rooftops - you don't tend to boast to your friends about how great your shaving gel is, do you. Therefore it was a huge surprise when the email arrived today offering me samples of their other products.

I'm now wondering what they make. While tempted to go and look at the website, a part of me says it will be more fun if I just wait for the parcel to arrive. I have visions of the scene in "What Women Want" where Mel Gibson is trying out the feminine products.

Oh - and my incredulity at the shaving gel being termed "software" was answered today too. The razor is hardware. The gel is software.

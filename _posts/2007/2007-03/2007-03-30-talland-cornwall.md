We arrived in Cornwall just after 7pm last night after a nightmare journey that found us stuck in just about every build-up of traffic between Marlow and Plymouth. Once past Plymouth, over the Tamar Bridge (pictured above), the traffic disappeared and the entire pace of life slowed down.

I love the south west of England. I've said it before, and I'll say it again - the further you travel away from London, the slower life becomes, and this is a good thing.

Following our arrival, Mum had made a cooked dinner so we sat down and ate too much, drank too much, and then I rolled into bed early like a complete lightweight - and slept like a log.

Today (Friday) started rather more slowly than has been typical for me of late. Although up at 8, it somehow took several hours to eat breakfast (bacon!), and have a shower. After everybody got up, we gave Dad his birthday presents...

We got him a book about famous naval battles (he's mad on anything to do with sailing and the ocean), and the latest James Bond movie on DVD - which he's watching right now.

We have a booking at the local pub tonight for a meal - where we fully intend to eat far too much, drink far too much, and have far too much fun.

p.s. Dad's dog 'Bosun' just sat himself right in front of the telly during a pivotal moment in the James Bond movie... which would be fine if Bosun wasn't a 180lb Newfoundland.

My friend Tracey, who writes at Gwelva Kernewek (very good blog btw) sent me a link to a t-shirt store on the internet today.

I think the above picture gives a fair idea of the wonderful t-shirts they have on offer. The site is called "Rosie Nieper" and can be found at www.rosienieper.co.uk Go - go look at silly shirts now. I command you.

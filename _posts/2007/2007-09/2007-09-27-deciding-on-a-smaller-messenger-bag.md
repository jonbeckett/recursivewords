After carrying my Macbook across London in it's Messenger bag during the London Underground strike last month for several days, I somehow managed to injure myself (you can see what I had been carrying in my post "The Macbook Gets a Bag").

Any experts out there on bio-mechanics will probably be able to explain why the muscles around my hip began to hurt while carrying the uneven load on one shoulder. Walking upwards of 10 miles each day with a fairly heavy bag on one side of your body wasn't probably the best idea I ever had.

So - the Macbook has been relegated for the time being to a bit part in my commuting life, and I am on the lookout for a smaller messenger bag - small enough to carry a novel, my point-and-shoot camera, mobile phone, moleskine notebook, and deodorant.

After spending several hours looking around on the internet, here's what I have found so far;

"Normal" Messenger Bags...

My favourite so far...

As you can see from the graphic I stole from their website, the bag comes from TokyoToys.

At first I thought "that's so cool!", then I had reservations about it looking a bit weird - wearing a shirt and tie, and having a Manga inspired bag.

Thinking a bit more about it, I began to get a little uppety and thought "damn it - why should I fit in and be boring?". I have never been somebody who follows the herd. Perhaps using the Macbook is symptomatic of "thinking different" - being my own person. Perhaps I'm just an individual - or dogmatic.

Of course, if I get the Manga style bag, I have to get a coat that it doesn't look stupid hanging from. Something warm. Maybe a huge baggy coat with a furry collar? Or one of those down filled Michelin Man inspired monstrosities (on second thoughts, I am not so unthinking to my fellow train passengers to unleash such a coat upon them).

Any ideas?

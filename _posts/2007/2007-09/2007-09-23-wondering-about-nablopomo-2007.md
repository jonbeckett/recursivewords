During November last year I took part in "National Blog Posting Month" (NaBloPoMo), and had great fun doing so. For those wondering what on earth I am on about, the basic challenge of NaBloPoMo was to write at least one blog post each day throughout the calendar month of November.

With fond memories and new friends - many of which I still have today - I looked this evening to find out if any preparations are in place to do it again this year.

I found nothing.

This is a quick straw poll - if anybody would like NaBloPoMo to happen this year, I am willing to set the wheels in motion to host it myself. I have the knowledge, experience and skills to build the website and run it. I just need people to tell me to do so.

Tell everybody and their dog to head this way if you want to lend support to NaBloPoMo happening in 2007. I can do it, and I will do it if asked.

Postscript - after communicating back and forth with the people who ran NaBloPoMo last year, I've pulled the site that I threw up last night, in readiness for the wonderfulness that is "NaBloPoMo" to revisit us this year from www.nablopomo.com.

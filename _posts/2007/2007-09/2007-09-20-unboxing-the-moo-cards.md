My "moo" cards finally arrived today, so I have done the honours, and photographed the unboxing for your interest and amusement.

For those not in the know, moo cards are small business cards available from moo.com, and are perfect for giving people your phone number or email address. You can either choose from several hundred pre-drawn pictures to go on them (as I have chosen), or use your Flickr photo albums to put your own photos on them. If you have children I can see this being a great way to give out new mobile numbers and so on with photos of the kids on to relatives and friends.

The cards come in a recyclable plastic box...

... inside which you get 100 cards, with whatever mixture of photos, designs or patterns you wanted...

... I am very happy with the quality of my cards - the printing and general "finish" is excellent...

All I have to remember now is to put a few in my wallet - so next time we're at any kind of gathering I can dish them out to suitably impressed friends.

I travelled home on the train tonight with an idea in my head. An idea for a blogging website.

I got in at 7pm, ate my dinner, sat down at the computer at about 7:30pm, and started building things. By 11pm I was done.

Here's the result...

The idea behind "BlogFriday" is to write a blog post based on a theme "word" each week, and get the URL posted onto the website before the end of Friday. At the stroke of midnight on Friday the word changes, and the list of blog posts resets (in reality, they are archived away, but I've not built the archive browsing bits yet).

Now of course, I am bracing myself - to see what people think of the idea. Will they like it? Hate it? Love it? Not be bothered?

Let me know what you think. If you like the idea, tell everybody you know about it. It should be a really great way of getting your writing "out there", attracting new visitors to your blog, and an easy way to find new blogs to read.

Do you ever wonder where your weekend goes?

The clock is racing towards 11pm on a Sunday evening, and I'm wondering where my weekend went. Somewhere inbetween tidying the house, building a chimenea, a garden bench, and wandering to the pub with W's family, the next week is already arriving, and I'm still tired from last week. This isn't a complaint - it's a statement of fact. It's the way things are for us at the moment.

Tomorrow I am off to visit a client of the place I work in Hillingdon. On Tuesday I will be in the east end of London. On Wednesday I will be in Amersham for an adoption meeting, and on Thursday back in London again.

I need the world to slow down.

While commuting recently I have been taking my Macbook with me to entertain myself with podcasts and writing of emails. I can't help wondering if writing so many short posts to blogs or emails is damaging my writing - but at the same time I wonder if the act of writing is the important thing - and that the perceived quality is not important.

Perhaps I'll pear my messenger bag down to the essentials - the Moleskine notebook, the fountain pen, and my thoughts. The better titbits can always be transcribed on an evening. It may lose some immediacy, but the writing might just gain some style.

I annoy myself. I know I can write to a far higher standard than I usually subject the readers of this blog to. In the past I have gone through periods of "trying harder", and unsurprisingly gained readers during those times.

It's not about how many people read though. It's about me venting my thoughts. Making sense of things. Sharing my corner of the world.

Strange thing, this internet. The moment I click on "send", these words might be read on several continents. Best not to think about that really.

After several weeks running between counties of England with my work to visit faceless office buildings, the weekend has arrived once more, and half of Saturday has already rolled past.

What have I acheived so far this morning? Nothing.

What do I hope to achieve today? Nothing.

I need a quiet weekend. I need a rest. Some "me" time. Time to write in my blog. Time to catch up with friends. Time.

The one thing I do need to accomplish today is the choosing of a piece of poetry to take with me to a Burns night supper we are going to tonight. If anybody has a poem they would like to recommend, feel free to comment.

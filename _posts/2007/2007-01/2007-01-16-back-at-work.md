For the first time in what feels like weeks, I am back in the office at work - writing up notes from the various site visits I have been taking part in, and trying to "catch up" with the goings-on here.

It's 10:30 in the morning and it feels like it should be lunchtime already. The day is crawling past. I have some revision materials on my desk, and not much else to be getting on with (not that I'm avoiding revision).

The one bonus of the day so far is the re-installation of "Flock" on my work computer. Flock is a web browser - built on top of the same core as Firefox - that allows you to write to your blog just by pressing CTRL+B. A window pops up, and off you go. The really neat thing is it also knows all about Photo Bucket and Flickr, so you can drag photos into your blog post.

Anyway - enough geekiness.

Today my lunch consists of a "Cuban Style Pork Wrap", and "British Ham and Salad". They both came from the place W is working at the moment - they do pre-packaged food, and had a tasting day going on... we got some of the leftovers because W couldn't bare to see it go to waste. Hey - I'm not going to complain!

I promise to write something more intelligent later.

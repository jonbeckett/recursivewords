After rolling out of bed at nearly 10 this morning, it was decided that we should put our coats and boots on, and venture out into the surrounding countryside to get some fresh air, enjoy the day, and actually do something for a change...

We set out mid morning to walk to Cookham, a small village several miles along the river Thames, on a circular walk from a book that W has. This seemed like a fine plan - especially so when I discovered that the halfway point would involve a pub, a pint, lunch, and a sit down.

A selection of the photos from the day are available over at Flickr, so rather than ramble on and on, I have provided the link below...

(p.s. it's supposed to be "de-lurking week", so feel free to post as many comments as you want)

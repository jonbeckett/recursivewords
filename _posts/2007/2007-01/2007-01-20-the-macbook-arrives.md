I finally have a MacBook. My prediction nearly came true too about various disasters occuring to prevent it's arrival. Last night the heating packed up in our house, and then this morning while travelling to the store to purchase the MacBook, the right rear shock of our car dumped it's damper fluid onto the road - making the suspension sound like Ringo Starr on a bad day.

As the photo above proves however, we made it. So far it's been a journey of blind discovery. I have never used OSX at all, and the Mac comes with no instructions to speak of. I guess my mentality is a little different than most though - I immediately wanted to connect the machine to the network, to network shares, to instant messenger networks, and to all manner of other things.

So far I have figured everthing out except connecting our printer, which is connected to a Windows XP machine in the study. OSX can see the printer, but cannot talk to it in an appropriate language - and there appears to be no easy solution to it (well, not without installing a load of rubbish on the Mac, which I am unwilling to do).

The overriding impression so far is that OSX is a much more polished product than Windows XP. I don't think it's quite the nirvana that some people would have you believe, but it is very, very good.

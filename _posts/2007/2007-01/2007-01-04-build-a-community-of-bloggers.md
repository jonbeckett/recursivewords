I have been thinking. About community stuff.

What community type stuff do you use on the internet? MySpace? Vox? Yahoo 360? Nothing?

Here's the idea. If enough people are interested, I will make a forum specifically for bloggers to talk about things to do with blogging. I can do the technical bits very quickly (standing on my head in fact) - I just need to know if enough people might be interested.

We could turn it into something that nobody "owns" - it's run by the group, with no overall administrators. In my experience administrators quickly become bossy, and bossy people are a bad thing.

The forum could be used to tell each other about new blogs we're reading, techie stuff to do on a blog - that kind of thing. All the subjects you would not normally write about in your blog. I could even wade in with the odd post explaining technical stuff from time to time.

What do you think?

If you do think it's a good idea, tell everybody you know to come here and add their two penneth...

Okay... there was enough positive feedback for me to do something about it - click on the link below;

Next week will find me joining the daily commute to and from London, so I am trying to use today productively - relaxing.

I have the box set of Ghost In the Shell to watch, a nice hot cup of tea, and a new PS2 game to play (well... new to us). It's called "Disgaea 2", and involves all kinds of exploring, fighting, casting of magic spells, and collecting things - your typical role playing game then...

I must be going - I have very little to do.

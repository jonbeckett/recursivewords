While listening to the Showgirl Homecoming concert tonight, the idea popped into my head that it might be fun to stick a different icon at the top of the blog each week or month. This all came about because I managed to wipe my blog template earlier, and was thinking "is it time for a change?"

So - this month... well, next month... is Kylie.

W suspects there is a genetic fault in men that makes them powerless to Miss Minogue's charms. As much as my rational mind tries to reject the idea, I'm inclined to agree.

Kylie Minogue is a wonderful role model for young girls though - aside from the songs and amazing stage shows (perhaps the last of a generation that can fill stadiums), she has not tried to get herself photographed sans knickers, and she has recovered from cancer in a somewhat miraculous manner.

By now all the girls who read this blog will be shaking their head and preparing various shapes and sizes of bag / fryingpan / hand to swipe at me.

Better start running.

She is lovely though, isn't she

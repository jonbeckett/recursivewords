I saw this idea on Alex's Vox blogto visit Google Images, search for your name, and post the first picture that comes up.

Here's my alter ego (I was surprised my own image didn't come upalthough it is there on the first page, given the number of internet pages I must appear in). Apparently this "Jonathan Beckett" is a Jazz musician, studying at the University of North Texas.

Here's the bio from his website (so he's the bugger that bought  http://www.jonathanbeckett.com [http://www.jonathanbeckett.com/]!)

Originally from Springfield, Missouri, Jonny now lives in Denton, Texas. A saxophonist since fifth grade, Jonny is primarily tenor player. Jonny obtained a B.

M. in Jazz studies from Loyola University in New Orleans and has recently been awarded the Masters of Music from the University of North Texas. A few of Jonny's accomplishments at the University of North Texas include playing 1st alto in the prestigious One O'Clock Lab Band as well as serving as the director of the Four O'Clock Lab Band. Jonny plans to obtain his doctorate in jazz studies.

Over the years, musical opportunities have taken him to Europe, Asia, the Caribbean, Australia, New York, Boston, Miami, Seattle, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Phoenix, Houston, Austin, Chicago and Branson.

So you there you goyou learn something new every day. Thanks for the idea Alex!

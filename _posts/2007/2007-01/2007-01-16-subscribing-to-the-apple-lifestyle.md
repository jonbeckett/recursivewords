While talking about my imminent purchase of a MacBook last night, W commented that I cannot be seen with a MacBook unless I subscribe to the "Apple Lifestyle".

After finishing snorting my drink through my nose, we tried to figure out what the "Apple" person looks like. The stereotype says clean shaven (for a guy), either shaved head or long (but tidy) hair (again, for a guy), and a black polo neck... or maybe carefully scruffy cargo pants, deck shoes, and a ThinkGeek t-shirt.

Will becoming involved in Apple products engender eastern schools of thought? Will I become minimalist - will I value well crafted tools, and abhor clutter and distraction?

After spending my entire professional career working with PCs running various flavours of Windows and Linux, how will using an Apple computer affect me? Will I be liberated? Will I miss the hours of tinkering, the hours of problem solving, and the money spent on security and virus protection?

I think not.

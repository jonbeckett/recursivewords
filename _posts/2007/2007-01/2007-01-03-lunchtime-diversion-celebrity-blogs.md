While taking a break from studying this lunchtime, I headed over to del.icio.us, and did a search for "celebrity blog" to see what came up (del.icio.us is a social bookmarking service, and is well worth checking out).

The pages below are listed exactly as they came out - I have not censored, altered, re-ordered, or anything like that. What follows is the most relevant 5 entries from the list of bookmarks people have stored for the words "celebrity" and "blog"...

Perez Hilton

"Perez Hilton" is the pseudonym of "Mario Armando Lavandeira Jr." - a celebrity gossip columnist who finds his way into all kinds of hollywood parties and events to be photographed, and photograph the various stars. Celebs such as Christina Aguilera, Jessica Simpson and Britney Spears are all covered. It's sarcastic, self absorbed and at times cruel. The main aim of the author seems to be getting photographed with his various victims.

The Superficial

"The Superficial" is a pretty generic blog covering the appearances of various celebs in the media. It's one of the more polished offerings out there, and tries to give balanced opinion on the various stories. As an example of content, there is a big feature a couple of days ago of Jessica Alba playing football in her bikini. Need I say more...

Go Fug Yourself

One of the most entertaining blogs of the group - "Go Fug Yourself" concentrates on celebrities who have been captured on camera having left their dress sense (or stylist) at home. It's funny, inventive, and sometimes a little cruel, but then these people went out to get photographed right? The current front page picture is of Courtney Love not having one of her best moments...

Pink Is The New Blog

"Pink Is The New Blog" is probably the most entertaining of the group. It's written by Trent Vanegas, and covers all celebrities everywhere. Trent is a "fan" of the celebrity set, and for many z-list celebs, getting a mention on his blog is a part of the ladder. It would appear that the site is famous enough to get tipped off with various photos sent in that should never have been taken.

Defamer

The tag line at the top of "Defamer" says it all - "LA is the world's cultural capital. This is the gossip rag it deserves". It's probably the best written of the 5 blogs featured here. It takes a huge swipe at the A-List celebs, and pulls them to bits. Witness the recent story about Tom Cruise's Christmas Doilys (yes, really). And you thought Tom was only slightly nutso...

So there you go. 5 celebrity blogs gathered together from del.icio.us. Perhaps I'll do a search for "blogs written by celebrities" soon.

It's Monday morning, and I am preparing for a busy week ahead. At least I find myself in the office this morning - unlike the last few months where I seem to have been running between pillar and post without a chance to take stock.

Tomorrow I will travel to Bishopsgate, on Wednesday and Thursday I will attend a training course at some far flung training location, and on Friday I might get a chance to sit down again. This type of schedule has probably been going on for far too long - in the end the breakneck turnovers from day to day grind you down; I have been feeling progressively more tired over the last week or so.

This weekend was a welcome respite - I stayed in, learned all about the world of the Apple Mac, and did nothing else. When I say "learned all about", I am really saying "learned that the Mac does everything for you.". It was a pleasant surprise.

Okay. Time to hit the Microsoft Outlook... (literally)

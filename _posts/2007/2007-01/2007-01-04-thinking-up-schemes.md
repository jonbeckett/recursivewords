I am sat here at work, studying books for an exam, preparing for a site visit next week (I am returning to London), and quietly trying to figure out how to amass enough money to buy an Apple MacBook.

Isn't it beautiful...Isn't it awful when you see something you would like, but you cannot justify it. I have been in love with the Apple MacBooks for a while, and after playing with one a few days ago can finally see myself untangling the Microsoft monster's tentacles from my person.

You may not have noticed, but there are Google adverts riding the margins of this blog. They make me a billionth of the price of a MacBook every time somebody happens to click on them by accident. I considered hacking the Google advert box to force mouse clicks on it, but then realised that Google employ people far more clever than me to catch just such attempts.

I am more or less resigned to the fact that there is no easy way of making money - especially for frivolous purchases that I will forget about after a few days. If I do make any money at anything, it will more than likely get swallowed up into the black hole that is our bank account. I was given money for christmas, and have been clinging to the idea that it could start the MacBook fund - with a totalizer and everything (maybe on the side of the blog, so you can share in the excitement of me never reaching the target).

The crazy thing is that I have a rare skill. I can make things on the internet. From nothing. I have tinkered from time to time with pet projects (as witnessed by the Blog script, the CMS system, the Writers website, Ws Blog, the Nexus community site (a PenPals site), and a number of commercial websites that I'm probably not allowed to name). I always end up doing stuff for nothing though - I can do pretty much anything, and yet I hardly ever charge people.

If only I was more mercenary - more of a capitalist. If I became a money grabbing greed monkey I wouldn't be the person I am though - I wouldn't spend hours each week wandering around other people's blogs, getting caught up in the story of their life, and dispensing comments like so much hand crafted confetti.

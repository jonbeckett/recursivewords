Just a few words today before heading out into the rain on the streets of London to find something to eat.

Main news as of last night is that we are moving forwards towards the next step of the adoption journey - we had a phone call from our social worker, letting us know that she had met with the various required people yesterday to discuss our potential match with "the children" (any details of which I obviously can't share at all), and that they see no problem in going forward to a matching panel in late December.

The next hurdle is to put in place all the information and plans we will need to ahead of the matching panel. Schools, doctors, that kind of thing.

All of a sudden what seemed like an infinitely far off event is racing towards us. Things to do. People to meet. Stuff to buy. Furniture to build. Ponds to fill in. Kitchens to reorganise. Ornaments to pack away.

When telling a close friend about the prospective dates "if everything works out okay", she responded with how many weeks away that is. We had never thought in terms of a number of weeks. It had been years and months until now. Now it is weeks.

I'm going to keep my fingers tightly crossed - not only that we reach the finishing line in one piece, but also that I turn out to be as good a Dad as everybody says I will be.

Following pressure from friends and family, I have updated my list on Wishlistr with the things I would like for christmas...

Just click on the image above, and you get to see all manner of things I might like. I don't usually do things like this, but with a family spread far and wide that I know read my blog, this is the most sensible way of letting them know.

If you would like to get me something, please check with W first to see if somebody else hasn't already got it. Of course, if anybody gets me anything I'll be forever grateful and talk about how wonderful they are all the time on my blog. Really... I will.

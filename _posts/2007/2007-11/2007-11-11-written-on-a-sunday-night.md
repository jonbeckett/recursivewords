Winter has announced it's imminent approach in recent days. Leaves have now fallen from trees, and a silent cold darkness races through late afternoon to blanket the evenings.

A glass of brandy and a Kate Rusby album accompany me as I sit in our study, painted with light from a single lamp - room to write scraped from a desk bedecked in all manner of miscellany. Phones, games machines, hairbrush, camera, books, pens, puzzles, magazines, and numerous notebooks surround my elbows and hands. A pot of cheap pens hides behind a photo of our honeymoon.

In another corner of the desk my fifteen year old cousin in San Francisco peers from a decade old frame. She is happy - her smile is infectious.

I have no tasks to fulfill. No reason to be here. I am freewheeling. I choose to be here instead of perched in front of the television, and am reminded of the closing lines from "A Martian Writes a Postcard Home"...

At night, when all the colours die,

they hide in pairs

and read about themselves -

in colour, with their eyelids shut.

Today has been a day for poetry. Perhaps when retreating within ourselves - as I have done today - we tap into something greater than ourselves. Perhaps not. Who knows.

What causes us to write? Why do we share these thoughts? My brother in law will no doubt question what I have been eating - or, indeed, how much brandy I have drunk. I will answer that this was my first, and ask if more might unlock further wisdom.

Of course it will not.

I am reminded of a long forgotten colleague who recounted stories of experimentation with various illegal substances in his youth - and the memory of a moment of clarity while out under the stars one summer night - when his uneducated mind grasped the true nature of the universe for a few moments. He understood gravitation and relativity for a fleeting time and remembered that moment for the rest of his life.

Is it better to have glimpsed that we cannot reach, or stretched for that we should not reach for ?

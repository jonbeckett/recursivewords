Those who visit the PluggedOut website will perhaps be wondering what on earth has happened - the website has changed considerably once again. I have been tinkering - that's what has happened.

The screenshot gives some idea of the changes. The template is called "The Morning After", and is far more magazine influenced than previous templates I have used.

If you visit the front page of the website, you will notice several sections now - the "Latest Story", a "Featured" story, and a number of "Asides". Alongside we also have a number of "Recent Posts", and the pre-requisite posting category breakdown.

Apart from that, the rest of the blog remains the same in terms of content, comments and so forth. You can reach the RSS feed either through Feedburner or via www.pluggedout.com/feed.

I'm still in the process of tinkering, so if you have any feedback on the current look and feel of PluggedOut, do leave a comment - it will be listened to. It's worth pointing out that the move away from Hemmingway was primarily driven by comments from visitors that it was difficult to read and navigate. It's easy to lose sight of the basics when seduced by design.

It's the form versus function debate, isn't it. Hopefully PluggedOut is beginning to find a balance.

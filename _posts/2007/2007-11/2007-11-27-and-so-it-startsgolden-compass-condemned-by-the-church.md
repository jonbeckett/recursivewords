I guessed this would happen some time ago, and today the headlines appeared on the BBC News website. A group called "The Catholic League" has condemned the new movie "The Golden Compass" (based on the book "Northern Lights" by Philip Pullman).

After giving it a great deal of thought, rather than ramble on with some hugely complicated discussion about the existence (or not) of God, it occurred to me that if "The Golden Compass" promotes atheism, then "The Bible" promotes religious fundamentalism.

That's all I have to say about that.

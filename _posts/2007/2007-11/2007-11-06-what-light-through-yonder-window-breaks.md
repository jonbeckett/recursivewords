Isn't it wonderful when a day starts out well, turns into a steaming pire of excrement, and then finally bursts forth into a feel good evening, with reminders of what makes you smile, who makes you smile, and what makes you happy.

Needless to say, a few difficult days are calming down, and the maxim "it's good to talk" has proved it's worth once more.

On balance, a good Tuesday to mark against the calendar of my life. One to remember perhaps, as a warning that even if a day appears to be vanishing down the tubes in quite spectacular fashion, that is a signal to firm your grip and stay the course.

There is a lesson here to remind myself during the difficult times ahead, isn't there. It brings to mind the wonderful movie "Field of Dreams" - and the ethereal voice whispering "go the distance".

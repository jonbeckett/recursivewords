I have now had a cold for a month. I should be in the Guinness book of World Records or something. If the causes of colds are to be believed, I could qualify for multiple categories - "most run down person", "weakest immune system", "most tired person". The possibilities are endless.

After taking the day off yesterday to try and give my body a fighting chance, I am back in London today (on a coffee break before you wonder about me writing during work time), sniffing and coughing like a champ. This cold seems to be coming and going - perhaps that's my immune system belatedly coming to life and starting to get some momentum up. Yesterday evening I felt great, and then this morning I felt like death once more.

Perhaps it's a new thing? A sinusoidal cold or something (ooo - I think I just made that word up).

I also have a confession. I haven't read or commented on any blogs for several days. I haven't really used the internet for several days. The Playstation 2 has provided an enormously persuasive diversion for the first time in months. Several raids of the Blockbusters bargain bin have seen me playing "Metal Gear Solid" for the first time in my life. I've also been pretending to be good at skateboarding in Tony Hawks something or other (a fun game where you brain yourself repeatedly while shouting "cool", "rad", "standard", and other such modern words). I had a skateboard the first time around - before all this hoody crap started.

I still have memories of my Mum hitting me after tearing the knees out of a brand new pair of (dark blue) denim jeans after displaying my woeful lack of talent with skateboards. Doesn't make sense really, does it - your parents buy you the skateboard, you fall off it, then you get told off for it.

I need another coffee - then I might feel up to writing the recursive procedure that's been in my head all weekend.

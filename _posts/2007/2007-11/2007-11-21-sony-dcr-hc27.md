While W was busy entertaining her friends yesterday evening (I gather it was body-shop style girlie shopping party type thing), I went looking on the internet at reviews of budget video cameras.

I ended up getting one of these...

It's a Sony DCR-HC27 video camera. I got it from Pixmania on account of them selling it along with a spare battery, six tapes, and a good bag.

Why?

Now the adoption process is reaching it's conclusion, one of the things we have been asked to prepare is a scrap book, and (if possible) a DVD of ourselves, our family and our friends that our prospective children can see.

There's also the point that we have always said we would only ever buy a video camera if we had children - we could never see why you would otherwise bother (unless of course you are a movie making geek).

So there you go - I have ordered us the above camera, I have no idea how it works, and have no idea how to make a DVD on iMovie. No doubt I will learn very quickly.

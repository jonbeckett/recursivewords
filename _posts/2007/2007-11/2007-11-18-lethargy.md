Apologies for anybody passing by my blog and expecting to read insightful stories, opinions and thoughts.

I have now been ill for two weeks, and feel worse now than at any point so far. It's getting me down. I'm trying to read blogs and comment, and am getting nowhere. I seem to have no energy or will to do anything today. I'm caught in an up and down world at the moment. I got through yesterday, but today my batteries are flat once more.

Perhaps a shower might help? (I'm still sat here in my robe with hair resembling a particularly twisted tree).

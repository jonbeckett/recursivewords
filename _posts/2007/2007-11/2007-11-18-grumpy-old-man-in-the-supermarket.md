Something happened yesterday that has cheered me up no end.

On the way home from having lunch with Blogapotamus and her chap, we stopped at a big supermarket to get groceries for the week ahead.

While waiting at the till, there was a man in front of use buying two bottles of wine. When it came time for him to pay, he started disputing the price with the young girl at the checkout. I glanced up at him for the first time, and took him in.

W laughs even now when I say that on first glance I knew he was trouble.

He had a long beige cashmere coat on, was in his late 60s, and had too many teeth in his head. He talked like he had a mouth full of snooker balls.

Apparently he thought there should have been on an offer on the two bottles of wine he was buying, and started having a go at the checkout girl about it - claiming the checkout was wrong, and he should definitely have money off. The poor girl calls her supervisor over, who tells Mr Trouble that if the checkout hasn't turned up a discount, there is none.

He pushes the two wine bottles across the counter, and walks off, mumbling something loudly to himself as the checkout girl apologises to us for the other customer's behaviour.

We get on with bagging up our groceries and paying the checkout girl, all the while having a good laugh about idiotic customers. Then, just as we are about to leave, he re-appears, leaning over the checkout girl - shouting...

Mr Trouble - "You WERE right, but SO was Ioff them, and walked off. Only he didn't go home - he went back across the supermarket to check the prices and offers for himself - then found his way back to the young girl on the checkout to shout at her what she already knew.

We passed him again in the carpark. He was driving an enormous 44, which probably cost half as much as our house. Go figure.

I turned to W and said "I feel sorry for his wife..."

It's 10:30am on Sunday morning, I am still sat in my pyjamas and robe, have still not had a wash, or shave, and look for all the world like "the missing link".

I scraped myself out of bed at 9, and have spent the morning thus far alternately playing "SSX On Tour", and eating the remains of last night's pizza. W has now taken over the PS2, and has ordered me out of the room. Apparently she is far better at games when I'm not watching.

I left the living room saying "I should really go have a shower", but find myself sat here in front of the computer, writing a load of garbage to satisfy the promise to post every day this month. I figure the earlier I get it out of the way the better.

I have no plans this Sunday at all, so apart from backing up everything on the computer to Mozy (which may take several days anyway), I have no plans. I forsee clothes washing, commenting on blogs, and perhaps some writing may well populate the day. Oh - and video games.

Excuse me while I go and do battle with my stubble.

How is your Sunday looking?

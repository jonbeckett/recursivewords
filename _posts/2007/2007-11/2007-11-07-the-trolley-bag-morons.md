From small acorns might oak trees grow - and so do annoyances that could eventually end up with me kicking somebody to the ground in the middle of a busy railway station.

I would like to think the Police will come running, and join in kicking the target of my frustrations too.

I'm guessing the picture has probably explained the cause of my annoyance - it's those damn trolley bag things that businessmen seem to have registered as the latest "thing to have" in the city.

I have no problem with the bag itself - it's a really good idea for lazy people. My problem is the effect it has on the brain of the person towing it.

In the same manner that other people don't exist for old people in supermarkets armed with trolleys, other passengers do not exist for businessmen towing their hell trolleys.

It's like the trolley causes it's owner to lose all concept of "behind them". They merrily wander along, with the crowds tripping over themselves and each other to avoid the bloody thing. They somehow always ensure they are first off the train, and then stand on the platform, pinning the rest of the passengers into the train while they unfurl the handle and sort themselves out.

The same scene plays out at the beginning and end of every flight of stairs. On more occasions than I care to remember, I wanted to shout with as much fury as I might muster that they could consider just carrying their damn bag like everybody else. Of course I don't - I just stand there. Silent. Ticking like a bomb.

I have discovered however that a gentle tap to the side of a trolley bag - by accident of course - being towed at speed is enough to cause a fatal rolling motion. While you might hope this would cause the bag to turn over, the person towing it is usually so oblivious to their own actions that they don't notice it swing wildly into people behind them.

If you own one of these hell bag devices, please take it outside and burn it now. You have no idea how much of a hidrence you are to the entire rest of the human race.

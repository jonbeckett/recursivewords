During BBC's Children In Need programming last night, in between showcasing the Spice Girls, Boyzone, and the wonderful Kylie Minogue, they aired a specially made short of Doctor Who, called "Time Crash".

You can click on the above image to see the video on YouTube. I cannot enthuse enough - seeing both the current (and perhaps best Doctor), David Tennant, alongside the Doctor of my childhood, Peter Davison, was wonderful.

I challenge anybody who grew up with Doctor Who not to have been a little bit choked up when David Tennant said "You were my Doctor". Each generation of children throughout the 1960s, 70s and 80s had "their Doctor" - the one they had rooted for while hiding behind the sofa from the Daleks and Cybermen. It has been wonderful to see this happen once more with the modern series of Doctor Who - our friend's children talk in hushed tones of the amazing powers of the sonic screwdriver, and what Doctor Who might do in a particularly sticky situation.

In closing, what a wonderful way to end a post...

"To days to come..."

"All my love to long ago."

The former Chess world champion Garry Kasparov has been arrested in Russia for daring to take part in a march against Vladimir Putin.

I'm not going to write too much about it on my blog, because I don't want the Russian authorities pulling my website down. I will link to some articles about it though...

Isn't it wonderful that we can read a cross section of a news story on the internet and gain a wide ranging view of it.

I am at home with a cold. It's been tagging along with me for the last couple of weeks, and I think somehow my body had worked a miracle to keep it away at least until the weekend just gone was over with. After that it floored me.

Of course while a part of me says "I feel like crap", another part of me says "I am letting work down here". It's the first time I can remember having more than a day off with an illness in years.

I'm off to the chemist in a bit to see what they might have to knock it on the head.

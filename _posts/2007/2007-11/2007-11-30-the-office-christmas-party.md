Tonight is the night of the office Christmas party, held at the house of our Managing Director this year.

After spending the best part of nine months working in London, it will be the first time I have seen many of my colleagues since last year's party.

I'm really looking forward to it. I regard many of my colleagues as friends too (and socialise outside of work with a few of them regularly), so tonight feels more like a relaxed evening with friends than some parties I have been to in the past.

Most memorable work Christmas Party must be with a previous employer where the barman punched one of my workmates, and we were barred from the pub for life. Granted, we did assemble an effergy to the MD at the door to the function room which everybody had to kneel down to when entering or leaving... and we also "borrowed" the paintings of half naked ladies from the mens toilet to help decorate the room too. Thinking about it, that was the same year that (at the "unofficial" christmas party) I got to the semi final of the pool tournament, and couldn't stand up without holding onto the pool table - or focus on the balls any more.

We also found the new lad from the office unconscious on the floor outside the pub. I had encountered him earlier in the evening drinking Newcastle Brown Ale (bottled Insanity) - and decided to step away from him when a line of dribble started to hang from his mouth.

Happy days...

While looking through the attic for an old piece of computer hardware earlier, I came across a shoebox full of photographs - among them the long forgotten photos of a trip to San Francisco 10 years ago to help celebrate my cousin Charlotte's 21st birthday.

What follows is a reminder to just how much fitter and younger I looked back then. It was at least a couple of years before I met W, and before I owned my own apartment.

Fantastic memories...

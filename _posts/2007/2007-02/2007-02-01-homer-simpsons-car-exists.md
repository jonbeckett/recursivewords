Am I the only person in the world who can see the similarity between these two cars?

The one on the left is the X-Hawk Flying Car, being developed by Rafi Yoeli. The one on the right is of course the car that Homer Simpson designed.

I think it's fair to say that the guy who invented the X-Hawk car is a Simpsons fan, and is going to owe Matt Groening a lot of money.

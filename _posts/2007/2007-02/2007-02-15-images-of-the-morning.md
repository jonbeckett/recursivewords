Probably the last "photo blog" for a while (I need to get back to writing proper blog posts... posting photos seems a bit too easy - a bit shallow. I talked about this a few days ago.

Here's the 7:20 train from Marlow that I'm catching most mornings at the moment.

This morning the sun was coming up and showing the flooded fields between the train track and the river Thames. I saw the reflections and thought "people are going to want to see this".

Quite some time later, I am deep underneath London travelling on the underground trains. This photo gives a pretty accurate idea of what it's usually like - you have no room to move. It is so cramped you cannot fall over, although people do try and avoid falling into one another when the train goes round corners...

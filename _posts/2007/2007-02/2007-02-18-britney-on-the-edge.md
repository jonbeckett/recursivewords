While spending my Sunday evening catching up on the various news stories doing the rounds, I saw something quite sad. It would appear the media have finally tipped Britney Spears over the edge.

Apparently she walked into a hair salon yesterday and demanded the staff shave her head. They refused, so she grabbed the shears and did it herself. When asked why she was doing it, she said "to stop people touching me".

I just hope the media are justifiably proud of themselves now. They built her up, put her on the pedestal, and made her into a "star". Then of course they started cutting her down...

I hope she's not going to be found in a hotel room. I really do.

I know I've written about her a few times in recent months - in a way I'm not writing so much about her - I'm really expressing my dissatisfaction with celebrity culture and the media in general. When was the last time you saw a news report about something good happening?

The media do not look for good stories - they look for disasters, tragedy and destruction. If they cannot find it, they try to make it happen. They wield their stick against the easiest targets, and keep hitting until they have a story.

Well done once again.

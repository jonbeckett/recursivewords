I have just spent the last three quarters of an hour walking the streets of London around the place I am working - in the spitting rain - both to stretch my legs, and to get some bearings.

While wandering along Bishopsgate, I looked along a sidestreet, and saw the "Gerkin" building towering above a row of imposing fake-edwardian offices (the photo above is an overhead of the same building). Although most people know the building as "The Gerkin", it's real name is "30 St Mary Axe" (i.e. it has no name). It was designed by Sir Normal Foster and Ken Shuttleworth.

Wandering a bit further along Bishopsgate I saw another famous street name - "Threadneedle Street" - home to the Bank of England, also known as "The Old Lady of Threadneedle Street".

It's strange, walking the streets of central London. Although London is huge, the famous buildings seem to be on top of one another - squashed into a few square miles in the middle of the city.

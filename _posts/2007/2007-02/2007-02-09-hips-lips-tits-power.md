I can't help feeling that while commuting has given me the opportunity to write endless photo blog posts, they are somehow more shallow than a normal post. Even more strangely, it would seem that photos generate more visitors to a blog than insightful commentary on your life. You can be the best writer in the world, but the appearance of a shapely body in whatever scantily clad state a female blogger might dare would seem to generate more traffic than my humble blog might in a month.

There are advantages to being female on the internet - precisely the same ones that are seen as disadvantages. Where most girls are faced with innumerable spotty idiots hitting on them at every turn on the internet, if they ever want to market something (a blog, for example), all they need to do is post a vaguely revealing photo, and shout "check out my ass!" or something similar. I'm not complaining - and I'm anticipating that this post is not going to go down well with the majority either. All it really hilights is how people like Britney and Madonna got famous.

This raises another question actually; is Britney Spears actually far more clever than she likes to appear? Is she another Madonna? Looking back at the early 1990s, Madonna became the master of manipulating the media. I have the "Sex" book in the attic somewhere - still sealed in it's aluminum foil cover. I thought it might be worth something some day. I find it rather amusing that Madonna is critical of Britney for her recent lack of underwear - maybe a little jealousy creeping in, that somebody younger can grab the headlines in exactly the same way she did?

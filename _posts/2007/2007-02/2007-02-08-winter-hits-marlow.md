I am working from home today following the skies depositing several inches of snow across most of the Thames Valley last night - it's still snowing hard now (9:30am), and doesn't look like letting up.

I was up at 6 and ready to go to London, but 10 minutes before leaving the house the BBC news announced that the train line I use to get into London was experiencing cancellations and delays - I decided to err on the side of caution and actually listen to the weather people on the television, who were telling people not to travel unless they absolutely had to.

After changing back out of my work clothes, I put my coat on and wandered down to Higginson Park in Marlow with the camera - click on the pics to see the originals on Flickr.

Once upon a time I wrote in the about pages of this blog that if anybody should ever write me an abusive email, I would almost certainly post the message in question to the blog. I never thought I would have an opportunity to do it - and then this arrived this week...

it is interesting that you feel you have a right to insert a smug, snotty little comment in [censored]'s blog, you geek.

you are a nobody, and your blog is pathetic. you come across as yet one more pasty little english person who uses other's blogs to try to generate attention. rather than focus on the goodwill of others, you chose to insert a snide comment. perhaps you should work on your own personality rather than shoot other people down.

blech.

I am not going to name names, or explain the context in which this happened - suffice to say that I found this email immensely entertaining, and thank the sender for brightening my day up.

Some people really do have far too much time on their hands...

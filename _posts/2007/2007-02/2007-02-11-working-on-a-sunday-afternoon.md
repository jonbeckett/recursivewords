Following last week's snow and falling behind with some things at work, I spent some of my Sunday afternoon trying to catch up a bit.

I didn't realise until I cropped the above image for the blog just how marked the size difference is between my work PC (the huge Dell laptop), and the MacBook. That will explain he difference in the weight of the bag I am carrying on my shoulder... Would you believe that the MacBook is more powerful than either the Dell or the Compaq desktop PC that is sat under the desk? I guess that's progress for you.

The rest of this evening is going to be spent scanning expenses from late last week, and filing them with work. What fun. Tomorrow I have to get the same piece of paper signed 5 times and fax it back to the office. How ridiculous is that?

I'm hungry. Food. I need food.

Since getting the Apple MacBook a couple of weeks ago, I have been making do with carrying it around in the bag that was bought for W's Windows laptop some time ago.

I spent several days scouring the internet for decent bags that were either directly designed for the Apple MacBook, or were just "good bags" - and was pretty horrified by the prices of some of them, and the design mistakes. Having lived with what I thought was a great messenger style laptop bag for a few weeks, I have learned that you really do need more room in the bag than for just the machine itself. Being able to store the plug and power adapter without it being in the middle of the screen is a fairly basic mistake 90% of bags make.

I have ended up buying two bags. One is a traditional messenger bag - and by far the best for the price I found on the entire internet, and the second is a protective sleeve for the MacBook to sit in while in the bag - the idea being that I can throw the big bag in the luggage rack on a train, and have the sleeve on my lap.

The main bag is a Choroka K1...

It's a classic messenger style bag, with loads of room for books...

Within the bag, there's loads of room for the MacBook encased in it's "LA Robe" protective sleeve...

And within the form-fitting sleeve, you can see the Mac is safe and well...

The sleeve is actually far better than I thought it might be - made from memory foam, which provides a hard but compressible shell.

Looking inside the Pakuma messenger bag, I realised that it will help the MacBook survive all but the most violent collisions too - it has padded cells all around the place you put the laptop...

I have been pleasantly surprised by both the bag and the sleeve. The most important part of the bag design is that it has room for junk - pockets for things like the power adapter, my mobile phone, a couple of magazines, pens, a textbook or two...

On top of the messenger bag the MacBook now has it's own protective sleeve, which gives me something to carry it around in to protect it's shiny exterior.

Hopefully my finds will help others looking for similar transport for their MacBook.

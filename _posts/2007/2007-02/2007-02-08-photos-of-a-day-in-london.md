I finally remembered to take the camera with me on my commute today. Here's the various photos - feel free to click on them to see the full size versions in Flickr...

Early Morning in Marlow

Waterloo Station

Bishopsgate

Spitalfields Market

Liverpool Street

The real story of the day is not the above photos - the real story is that I met another old friend from the internet today, and we got on wonderfully. We went for a drink after work at Kings Cross, and I got to see what London looks like at night.

We talked, we talked some more, and then we talked even more about life, the universe and everything, and we vowed to bring our other halves along next time. Proper friends are pretty rare these days, so you have to hang on to them when you find them.

It's 11pm now, and I have to be up at 6am. Snow is forecast for the morning, so I'm anticipating the trains are going to be a joke.

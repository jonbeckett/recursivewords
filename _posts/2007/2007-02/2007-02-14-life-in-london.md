Somebody asked for more photos of life in London...

The typical day starts for me at about 6:15am when I roll out of bed - wander downstairs, jump in the shower, have a shave, and put on the clothes I prepared the night before. I leave the house at 7am, and arrive at Marlow railway station to catch the 7:20 train to Bourne End, changing to the connecting train that takes me to Paddington.

Rolling in to Paddington at about 8:15am, I have a fairly long walk into the station...

Following that, if I feel I have time (and am rich enough on that particuar day). I might wander into the cafe in the station, and get a cappuccino...

Then it's back out into the main food hall of the station, to find my way through to the underground station...

Finally, I wait for the eastbound circle line train, which takes me across London to Bishopsgate, arriving at somewhere between 8:50 and 9:30, depending on if I stopped for coffee or not.

The underground train varies greatly - today (when the photo below was taken) was very quiet - it's often so crowded you cannot move. Getting a seat is very unusual.

On an evening the same journey happens in reverse - with me leaving London at 5pm, and arriving at home by about 7pm. Of course these timings only apply when the trains "work" - if any part of the journey goes wrong, you can easily add an hour to the journey.

What do I do for the 2 hours each way? I read books, write emails, play chess on my palm organiser, daydream, catnap, and anything else that seems like a good idea at the time.

There you go - a day in my commuting life. As always, if you click on the pictures you can see the originals in Flickr.

Sometimes the internet can feel very lonely. I spend the greater part of each day "connected" to the internet - writing e-mails, sending and receiving instant messages, and commenting on blog posts. Being surrounded by these imaginary cities of virtual people, newspapers, stories and conversations does nothing to stop an occasional attack of the lonelies though.

I could perhaps liken it to my visits to London - which will be starting again on Monday. For three months or more I will travel into and out of England's capital city each day. The metropolitan area of London hosts something in the region of fifteen million people, and yet during my journey each day I will interact with perhaps two of them - the ticket conductor on the train, and the girl selling coffee in Paddington Station. Everybody else has their own agenda. In London if you are even stood in somebody's path you are in their way - you would never dare talk to anybody for fear of being considered a lunatic, pervert or terrorist.

The same thing is often true of the internet. You reach out to others through your blog, sometimes write posts baring the minutiae of your life, and often get nothing in return. You keep pushing - keep swimming against the uninterested tide, and finally you start to tire.

I am tired.

I can feel this blog turning into a conversation with myself - my own sounding board. Somewhere to organise the turbulent thoughts of the day.

Perhaps I am wrong. Perhaps people do read my inane thoughts. Perhaps they might even speak out from the crowd rushing past and nudge me on the shoulder, saying "hey, you're not so bad". Perhaps they'll greet me with a "good morning" from time to time.

A couple of years ago we were given a set of magnetic words to go on the fridge - with the theme of those words being "poetry". Although our fridge is hidden away in a cupboard, we do have a metal-fronted gas boiler in the corner of our kitchen, and the sea of words has lived on it's cover ever since.

Over time, via parties, house guests, and various moments of boredom the magnetic words have arranged themselves (with a little help from human hand) into sprinklings of poetry that I thought may be fun to share.

I'm not sure these poems should be given titles, so I will just paste them into the blog - as always, you can click on them to see bigger versions. We no longer have any idea if we wrote them, or which guests were responsible. They shall forever be enigmatic.

Enjoy...

It feels like I'm on some kind of treadmill at the moment. I'm working all kinds of hours, and regardless of how interesting the work might be there is a sense that the rest of the world is starting to pass me by. I am spending my life on trains, sat in offices, or working late on programming.

I want some of my life and friends back. I miss them.

At the moment I am usually getting back in the door at home by about 7pm - but I am generally so tired that I don't really spend any quality time with W. By the time we have got dinner out of the way and various chores done it is invariably late, and time to go to bed - except of course we stay up late to "have some evening", and end up going to bed in the early hours.

Going to bed at 1am is fine, as long as you don't have to be up at 6am the next day - as I do at the moment. I honestly have no idea how I am continuing to function.

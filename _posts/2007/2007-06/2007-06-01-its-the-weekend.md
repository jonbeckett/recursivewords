Finally, it's the weekend. Before starting, I would like to promise to anybody and everybody who knows me that I will make no further mention of "Big Brother". Perhaps I didn't indicate clearly enough that I had no intention of watching any more than the hour I did while stuffing my face with pizza the night before last.

(Somehow, watching something as brainless as Big Brother, and stuffing my face with pizza seemed like compatible activities - although I guess wearing a shell suit while doing so might have completed the effect...)

So - it's the weekend. We are looking forward to doing a web conference with our amazing friend Lunesse tomorrow to throw the world's first intercontinental baby shower. We have sent a huge box of goodies to the other side of the world, and at the agreed time we will fire up the webcams, crack open a drink, and open the presents together.

Lunesse may not know it, but I mention her quite often at work - she's one of the few people I know that worked as a web designer during the "dot com boom" - and right in the middle of San Francisco too. Since then she has "escaped the hive" (as she puts it), and is now making hand crafted glassware which she sells from her own website "Juiceglass". Anniversaries, birthdays and christmases often find me asking for comissioned necklaces, bracelets and earrings for W - and they are always amazing.

Other than that, (and this finally relates to the image at the top of the post) we are going to see Pirates of the Carribbean "At World's End" tomorrow night. We're both looking forward to it, and will probably make an afternoon of it - go out for something to eat beforehand, and then creep home at whatever hour it finishes. Friends who have seen it say it's great, but more of an epic than the comedy the first movie was - which is a good thing as far as I am concerned.

p.s. I fired the first volley in my fight with T-Mobile today. So far since signing up with them they have banned me from using FTP through my phone, instant messaging through my phone, and Jaiku text messages. I'm guessing Twitter will be next. I wouldn't mind, but when I first signed up with them I was able to do all these things. I can't even call overseas without first calling them and subjecting myself to a 20 minute round of customer services idiots before removing the call barring. Grrr....

Okay. Food. I need to go and order food. I'm hungry now.

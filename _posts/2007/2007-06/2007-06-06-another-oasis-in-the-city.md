While trundling towards Liverpool Street on the London Underground this morning the driver crackled over the public address system "This train will be terminating at Moorgate due to a passenger being taken ill on the train".

It happens the Moorgate is one stop before Liverpool Street, so I decided it might be an idea to walk the rest of the way to work rather than fight with the rampaging (and now grumbling) masses. I'm glad I did.

While threading my way through the streets, following blind faith and a dash of ready-reckoning, I found myself walking through Finsbury Circus...

I have now discovered two places to dissappear to at lunchtime in one week. London is becoming just a little more bearable.

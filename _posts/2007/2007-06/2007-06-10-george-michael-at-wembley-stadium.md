We set off late this afternoon for Wembley Stadium in London to see George Michael live in concert. Here are a few of the photos from the afternoon (they are in Flickr, so click on them for better versions)...

The concert was fantastic - and as much as I might have had reservations about going (I'm not a huge fan), I have to admit that George was brilliant. Of the live music - or even recorded concerts - I have seen, this was by far the closest to an original album in terms of his vocal performance. Amazing stuff...

The new Wembley Stadium is awesome. We were right up in the gods (as you can see from the photos), but it didn't really matter. Don't take any notice of what the NME is writing either - the sound quality was fantastic for a stadium.

I'll write more later in the week. I have work in the morning and it's already 12:30am.

It's 7:16, it's Monday morning, and the train will be leaving Marlow at any minute. I'm ready to fall asleep right here and now while sat on the train, but better not - I need to arrive somewhere near on-time this morning if I possibly can.

There's this scary guy sat two seats in front of me, peering over the top of the seats with beady eyes.

This weekend was a blur from start to finish. I can't even remember Friday night. On Saturday morning friends came over from W's home town for lunch, so we went to the big pub in town that has a restaurant (they had children with them, and this particular pub is very child friendly). We all ate too much and didn't really notice the slowest service in the world because we were too busy catching up with each other's news.

After lunch we went for a walk in Higginson Park - there was a church fate on, and thought it might be fun for the kids. We never got that far though. While walking through the park (throwing a frisbee back and forth) it started spotting with rain. By the time we reached the huge old oak trees alongside the river it had turned into a full-on thunderstorm. We spent five minutes huddled under mine and W's waterproofs before I decided enough was enough - they all ran for the car, and I ran for home (knowing I would not fit in the car). It's about a mile run home from the park, and I surprised myself - I can still runsession of Mariokart, and Smash Brothers Melee. I would like to say I did well, but that would be a bare faced lie. Why is it the prettiest (non video game playing) people always do best - usually Mums too? Perhaps it's because they too grew up in the era of coin-op space invaders, and have latent skills that they don't admit to.

The hilarity finally ended with Super Monkey Ball at 1am, and we said our goodnights. They had a long journey home (at least 200 yards), and we had a bed calling us.

Hmmm... "Hilarity" - strange word. Is that the feeling that you know Hilary Clinton is going to be the next US president?

Sunday was filled with washing clothes, washing more clothes, helping W sort out books to sell on the internet, and washing even more clothes. I now have lots of un-ironed clothes, as evidenced by getting up at 6am this morning, having a wash, shave, and then pressing a shirt and trousers. Somehow those few things took up nearly an hour - probably because my trousers looked like they had been to the world "see how much you can crease up your trousers in the dryer" competition.

I did nothing yesterday afternoon - save watching the MotoGP race on the television (Casey Stoner won - woohoo!). I guess I did change the washing over several times, but that's not really hard, is it.

Anyway. The train is about to fill up with people and any semblence of free-space will dissappear. I better finish this quickly.

I will post photos of the late-night Nintendo tournament later.

The place - Sloe, Paddington Station

The time - 8:30am

The date - Thursday 28th June 2007

I'm sat enjoying the comfortable surroundings of the new bar above Paddington station. It's been undergoing a refit for the last month or so, but is now very, very nice indeed (it wasn't bad before, but go figure...)

If anybody that reads this and works in London wants to bump into me here, feel free. Just no stalkerish people please. Shout me on Facebook (link at the foot of the page).

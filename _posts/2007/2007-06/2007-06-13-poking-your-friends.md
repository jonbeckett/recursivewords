Does nobody else think it's a little weird to "poke" your friends on Facebook?

I'm not sure of the connotations elsewhere in the world, but to "poke" in England means something somewhat more intimate that prodding somebody with your finger.

This is where somebody's going to inform me that street slang defines "prod" as the same intimate act that I'm awkwardly avoiding spelling out.

Interestingly, I just looked up "poke" in the dictionary, and discovered that "pokable" is a real word. The opportunities to use it are exploding throughout my unused brain cells (most of them). "She's rather pokable"...

This all serves to remind me of Petite Anglaise's t-shirt competition. The word "pokable" may be a rather clever t-shirt slogan (don't worry if this went straight over your head).

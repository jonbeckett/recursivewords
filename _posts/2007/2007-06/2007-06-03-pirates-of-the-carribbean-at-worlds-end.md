Arriving at the cinema a week after it opened, we finally went to see the final "Pirates of the Carribbean" movie last night - "At World's End".

I would like to say that I loved it, but I cannot. It was good - it just wasn't great. There were great moments, there were funny moments, and there were thrilling moments. They were moments though - that was the problem.

It wasn't helped by us having three people sat in front of us who insisted on talking throughout the first hour of the movie. It's worth explaining that the movie was 3 hours long, and the first hour and a half is very slow and involved - which was made impossible for me due to the distraction I had in front of me. W finally came to my rescue and told them to be quiet (which thankfully they did) - and the second half proved to be everything we had hoped it would be.

I didn't want to make a scene in the cinema because a guy usually cannot - there was a guy with the two girls in front of us who met all the stereotypes of putting up a show for the girls. Luckily if a girl is the one telling them to shut up then convention dictates that he cannot make any threats to a girl.

The thing that really puzzles me is why the people in front of us would have spent the extra money for the "gallery" seats at the cinema and then talked all the way through the movie? Our tickets cost 17 pounds each - that's just over 30 dollars for those of you in the US. Usually the gallery means you get comfy chairs and you are sat among people who love the cinema - so they will be silent while the movie is on.

Perhaps it's just me. Perhaps my natural concern for others means I cannot ignore people easily. That's not really true though, becuase I often block out people around me while concentrating on things. Why doesn't that work for the cinema?

Anyway - back to Pirates.

Best moment of the movie - for me - was probably the entrance of Keith Richards as Jack's Dad. If anybody looked like the genuine article, Keith did.

In a way "At World's End" was annoying - while the first 2 hours were ponderous, the last hour was perhaps the most exciting, thrilling hour I have spent in the cinema in years.

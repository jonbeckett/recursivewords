While out having a wander in the nearby streets at lunchtime, I happened upon perhaps the only green area for miles in central London, and while sat eating my lunch decided it might be an idea to take photos for your interest and amusement (click on them to see the originals in Flickr)

The Green Behind Liverpool Street

Telling the truth, I happened on this green some time ago, but it was very cold and deserted - what a change a little sunshine brings.

The Sculpture

Turning 180 degrees, and this rather fabulous sculpture takes pride of place. I love sculpture... always have.

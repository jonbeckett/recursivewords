A few evenings ago, W and I sat down to watch a movie I bought several weeks ago - "The Prestige".

I can't say a great deal about the plot - purely because it would ruin it for you. We watched it with no preconceptions of it other than the trailer (which you watch via YouTube below), and I would recommend that other people do the same.

It's by far the best movie I have seen over the last couple of years. It's the first time in a long time that I have seen a star studded movie with a script and story to match. It's brave enough to be original, and it pays off in spades.

If you buy one DVD over the next few months, really think about getting "The Prestige".

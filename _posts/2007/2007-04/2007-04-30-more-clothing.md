While crashed out on the couch (I am off work with a virus today), it turns out W (who is also off work) was buying things on the internet.

I am now apparently the soon to be proud owner of the following garments from Joe Browns...

Joe Browns T-Shirt

Joe Browns Trousers

Joe Browns Jeans

While it may look like W has taken over the decision of what clothes I am getting, in reality she watched me go through the catalogue a couple of days ago, and took notice of the things I liked. She's sneaky like that.

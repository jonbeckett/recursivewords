I'm not at work today. I'm sure if I appeared in the computer game "Theme Hospital", they would diagnose me with some weird sounding thing called "thick head", or similar. It's probably just a head cold, but has been enough to make me feel awful...

Just what I needed really... falling even further behind with work, and so far behind with reading and commenting on friend's blogs now that the pile of unread posts is starting to resemble the rubbish mountain in Idiocracy.

After talking to W this afternoon it looks very much like I will be heading out over the next couple of weeks to do my spectacular wardobe renewal. Although I have titled this post "The Annual", this is probable more accurately bi or tri annual... where I throw out a lot of worn out clothes, and buy a whole stack of new clothes - usually with a style change on the way.

I thought it might be fun if I involved people who read my blog in the clothes I choose. I'm rubbish at choosing clothes, and am hoping that the girls out there can take me in hand.

I'm asking you to put your "style guru" hat on, and comment this post with links to clothes in internet clothing stores that you like, and you think I might like. I will photograph the clothes I actually buy, and thank people for their help in finding me a direction.

The only brief I would possibly put forward is that I now have an iPod and a MacBook. Quite what that translates to in the way of clothes I will leave up to you. I'm 6'3C/3 tall, and average build (photo above is a guide).

(oh god... what have I done...)

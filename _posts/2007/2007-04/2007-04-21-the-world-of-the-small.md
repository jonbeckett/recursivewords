It's a wonderful afternoon in the UK - the sun is out, birds are singing, and things are growing in the garden. I grabbed the camera, switched it onto "macro" (hence the title of this post), and had a wander around our back garden - here are the results...

(they are in Flickr - click on them to see bigger versions)

Japanese Acer

This plant stands on the decking just outside the back door, and appears to die each winter - withering away to a lonely stick - but by mid March it comes back to life and sprouts these wonderful red leaves.

Cherry Tree Blossom

We planted three trees at the far end of the garden last year - one of them being this cherry tree. By the time I'm 80 I expect it will start bearing fruit (it had one cherry last year)

Apple Tree Blossom

Alongside the cherry tree is an apple tree. It's not very big yet, but we're hoping one day we'll be able to pick apples from it.

Tadpoles

The pond is raging with tadpoles at the moment. Thousands of them. Here's a little gang that appear to be making a break for dry land... somebody tell them their legs haven't grown yet.

More Tadpoles

Wriggle wriggle wriggle. That's all they do all day - honest.

Ceanothus

W confirmed the name of this plant from a book. These bugs are about the same size as a pencil eraser in reality. The wonders of Macro photography make them look far larger than they really are.

Dandelions

Apparently most gardeners hate dandelions with a vengeance. I like them. They are natural. I can't imagine anything worse than a manicured garden with neat flower beds, and a striped lawn.

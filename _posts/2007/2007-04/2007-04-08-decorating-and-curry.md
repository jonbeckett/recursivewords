While spending 90% of the weekend transforming our two spare bedrooms into liveable (and safe) future bedrooms for children, the other 10% was spent taking time out to spend with family who came to visit en-route across the country...

My cousin Charlotte, her boyfriend Jake and her mum Betty came to visit on Saturday night for a couple of hours to break their journey travelling between Oxford and east London. I went and collected an Indian take-away and some wine, and we had a fantastic evening catching up with one another.

Today was filled with more paint, more gloss paint (finally the woodwork!), cheese sandwiches, and easter eggs. I've just had a shower (and washed gloss paint out of my hair - don't ask), and am going to try and enjoy the rest of the evening. Feet up. Television on. Laptop on my lap.

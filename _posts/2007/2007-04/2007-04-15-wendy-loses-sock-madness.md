W (my wonderful other half) has been taking part in a sock knitting competition on the internet recently called "Sock Madness". It would appear there are far too many people out there though that have either (a) no life, or (b) take competitions far too seriously.

The idea of the competition seems to be to knit a pair of socks of a given pattern as fast as possible. W started as soon as we got back from her parents last night, stayed up until the early hours working on them, and was back up at 8 this morning to carry on.

It's worth pointing out that W is a fast knitter. She also takes great care - the things she knits are often mistaken for machine knitted garments.

About ten minutes ago she checked the photo board where progress was being posted in the competition, and discovered the girl she was in competition was had already finished both socks.

The only was this was remotely possible was by the other girl starting as soon as the pattern was made available, and either working straight through the night, or getting a friend to knit the second sock in parallel.

I just wish those remaining in the competition luck - it would appear to be an arms race now - who can cheat or deprive themselves of sleep the most effectively.

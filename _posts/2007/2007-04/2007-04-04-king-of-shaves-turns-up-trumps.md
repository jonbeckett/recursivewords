"Turns up trumps"? I'm wondering if I need to define what these words mean before continuing with this blog entry... perhaps not - perhaps they use the term elsewhere in the world.

I picked the parcel up from the post office this morning that King of Shaves sent me following their taking an interest in my blog the other day. W was sent a parcel too after we were a little cheeky and told them if they did a girls range, W would try it - they do, and they sent her some goodies too.

In the true spirit of the royal mail, hers arrived before mine, and mine didn't even get delivered to the house. Typical (please, somebody launch a second postal service in the UK). The fact that I am off work with a cold didn't really help my cause either - I called into the post office en-route to buy Lucozade.

So - what arrived in the parcel? Starting with W, she got...

Ted Baker Eu de Toilette, King of Shaves "Woman" cirtus shaving gel, "Woman" Vanish Hair Deo (apparently a deodorant that slows the re-growth of hair), "Woman" shave and scrub shaving gel, Active Skin Control Moisturiser, and "Woman" moisturising hair minimiser.

I got...

King of Shaves XCD Defender (moisturiser), Advanced Shaving Oil, UltraGel ULX Advanced Shave Serum, UltraGel ULX Advanced SHave Gel, and K2 eye cream.

I have no idea what the benefits are of half this stuff - but I'm going to have fun trying them out.

We were both laughing, looking at the various labels - the girls range is very simply packaged, with the name reflecting exactly what the contents does. The mens range is obviously being targetted at the early twenties guys who own good cars, and read car magazines... it's all very macho and techy sounding. Example - "New XCD Defender SPF8 AAD Facial Moisturiser is your first line in defence against UV light, pollution, stress, and lifestyle". Perhaps it's being done for the American market (or they have hired a Microsoft marketing guy).

Right. I'm back off to sit down and have my headache in peace.

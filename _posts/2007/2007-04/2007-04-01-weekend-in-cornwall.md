It's 8am on Sunday morning, and I have been up since 7 this morning when the dogs asked to go out. We are staying in the south west of England - Cornwall - with my parents who live just above Talland Bay.

We are having some proper "us" time for the first time in weeks - spending our days here either holed up in front of the fire, visiting the boat, or with friends.

Here's a photo of W's exploits yesterday...

We winched her up the mast of my Dad's yacht 'Nell' to help thread a new halyard through for the ensign - and clean the various electrical gear while up there.

Last night was probably the highlight of the trip - we visited our friends Tracey (of Gwelva Kernewek fame), Graham and their children in the evening. They supplied pizza, and we supplied beer. I first bumped into Tracey on the internet some time ago, and since then both of our families have met and got on wonderfully. She has rapidly become one of my closest friends - a valued face and voice in the instant messenger and emails during the stressed moments of the working week.

Apparently I walk on hallowed ground after displaying my Gran Turismo powers for Tracey and Graham's daughters last night. They started the evening with a Pontiac Sapphire, and ended the evening with a 700bhp super car. Job done.

I also have a number of photos on the MacBook as a result of myself, Tracey and Steve drinking rather a lot of lager and then playing with Photo Booth. I'll email them to Tracey and let her decide if she want's to subject the world to them. We were in tears more than once while taking them.

This morning I'm looking outside at the weather, and wondering if I'm really going to wander out along the coast path with W. She is hoping to do another training walk towards her Moon Walk training (before you ask, the Moon Walk is a marathon length walk through London during May in aid of Breast Cancer research).

Right. I feel some bacon and eggs coming on. (p.s. check out my Flickr page for pictures of my Mum and Dad's Newfoundlands - www.flickr.com/photos/jonbeckett73/tags/newfoundland.

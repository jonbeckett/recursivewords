We won our local pub quiz last night for the first time. We have come joint first before, but last night they changed the format of the quiz - meaning the music and tabloid newspaper questions vanished, and it was a true "trivia" quiz...

We had hopes of winning the "Best Team Name" too - with "Ken Dodd's Dad's Dog's Dead", but as we won the main quiz, they obviously didn't want to award that to us too.

Our team (myself, W, and our friends Andrew and Emma) took a bottle of Jacob's Creek Chardonnay home with us.

As I was falling asleep last night, W whispered "We won!" into my ear.

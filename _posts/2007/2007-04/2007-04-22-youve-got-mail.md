We are just sat here watching one of the many "100 best" programmes on television. This particular programme is the 100 most romantic movies. At number 30 they had "You've Got Mail" - the movie starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.

I'm not really sure how many people know, but W and I met on the internet - back when it was rare to do so. In many ways, You've Got Mail became "our movie" - we could associate so much with Meg Ryan when she described the anticipation of seeing new e-mail arrive.

The anticipation and excitement of receiving new email from close friends has stayed with me. After a difficult day at work, there is often nothing quite as uplifting as a few words from a loved one or close friend - asking how you are, how your day has been, and perhaps sharing with you a part of their day.

If you have somebody you care about - why not find the time right now to write them an email, a text message, a letter - anthing. They'll know they were on your mind, and you will have made the world a little better for somebody, somewhere.

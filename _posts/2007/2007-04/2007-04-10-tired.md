I woke at 5am this morning, and didn't go back to sleep. This would have been fine if I hadn't gone to bed at 1am. 4 hours sleep can't be good, can it.

Apologies to those who normally receive a "morning post" email from me - my head was buried in "Tyrannosaur Canyon" this morning on the train. I had forgotten how much I enjoy reading pulp fiction.

In other news, I spent an hour last night playing the various games I bought yesterday - and still ended up shutting it down and talking to friends on the internet. Perhaps I'm growing out of games? Perhaps not.

I keep wandering into shops in London at lunchtime, and seeing Nintendo DS Lites for sale, and thinking what a great idea they would be to carry with me on the train.

The thought was brought into sharper focus today by the release of this...

Yep - the Legend of Zelda has finally been released on the DS. I saw it in London today (I'm not paying full price for it though). I knew W probably had it on pre-order so I wasn't about to buy it for her either.

The thing is, W has a Nintendo DS. She's had one for about a year now, and has most of the good games for it. It goes everywhere with her in her handbag.

The reasons for not buying myself a Nintendo DS sound very grown up indeed...

It's a lot of money

There are only a few games I would play

The money could be better spent on other things

Do I really need it?

This growing up and becoming responsible lark is no fun at all, is it.

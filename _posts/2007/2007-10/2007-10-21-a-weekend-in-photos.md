For one reason or another I have had no time to write a blog over the last few days. A mixture of apathy, real life getting in the way, and fun stuff (such as going to see Ratatoille) conspired to keep me away from the keyboard.

It seemed the least I could do is post some photos from the last few days.

Cat's Eye View

A moment caught this morning of Simpson cleaning himself.

Macbooks and Knitting

W caught multi-tasking while waiting for her parents to arrive this morning.

Morning Dew

A drip of water hangs from a leaf of one of the trees in the garden.

Green

Dew sparkles in the grass as the first sunlight of the morning hits it.

On Patrol

Simpson appears once more - this time keeping a watchful eye on the blundering human (me) in his garden.

Harleyford

The main house at Harleyford in the mist on Friday morning.

Contemporary Dance

He's there all month - in front of Liverpool Street Station, come rain or shine.

Coffee and Cake

What better way to start the day when you arrive in London earlier than you had anticipated?

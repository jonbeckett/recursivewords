While wandering back towards Liverpool Street from Moorgate this lunchtime, I came across a street performer...

While watching in a slightly bemused manner, a rather pretty young girl (a fellow performer no doubt) handed me the brochure to the right. The performer is Paul-Andr Fortier, and he is performing "Solo 30 x 30" at 1:30pm each day in Liverpool Street until Thursday 1st November.

Apparently this is part of "Dance Umbrella 2007C/3, a part of Lonon's International Festival of Contemporary Dance".

I fished my camera from my pocket, set it to record video (which it is appalling at), and set about recording some of Monsieur Fortier for your interest and amusement. As I began filming he marched straight towards me in a threatening manner - I thought I was in trouble but it turned out to be a part of the act. When I first showed the clip below to colleagues at work, we tried to come up with suitably unsuitable music to dub over the street sounds, but I have decided to leave well alone. Enjoy...

(I promise to return with my proper camera later in the week).

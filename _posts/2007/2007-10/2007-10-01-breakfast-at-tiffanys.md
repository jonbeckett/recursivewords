Inbetween perusing the internet (which Leo Laporte quite wonderfully described as a "drinking from the firehose" recently), I have been watching "Breakfast at Tiffanys" on Joost.

For those who have not heard of it, Joost is on-demand television, on your computer - and it's completely free (there endeth the advert).

Note to self - don't start watching such wonderful old movies so late in the evening. Breakfast at Tiffanys ranks up there as one of my favourite movies of all time. It rubs shoulders with "Barefoot in the Park", and "The Apartment" in my affections of that era. They really don't make movies like them any more.

Finally, after watching my other half play on hers for several years, I have succumbed to temptation. It happened while wandering around Gamestation in Maidenhead earlier today. The neat little white boxes began talking to me. Whispering "you know you want me" - just like the voice in Field of Dreams.

I am a huge fan of Nintendo. Of all the video game companies, they are the only ones who really "get it". In the face of the Microsoft and Sony corporate behemoths who seem intent on inviting us to witness death, destruction and mayhem in as stark reality and audiophile clarity as possible, Nintendo are intent on making things that are fun. Games that can be picked up and played. Games that your friends can pick up and play. Games that children can pick up and play.

Of course I fully anticipate I will swear out loud on the train after losing at Tetris. I also anticipate being reprimanded by W after Brain Training accuses me of having the brain of a geriatric.

I'll let you all know how it goes.

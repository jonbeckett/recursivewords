While reading the newspaper this weekend, I happened upon the story involving the Archbishop of Caterbury - Dr. Rowan Williams - attacking Richard Dawkins, his book "The God Delusion", and his ideas about "Memes". I settled back in my chair, and started rubbing my hands. This was going to be good.

For those who have no idea what this is all about, some background...

Richard Dawkins is a celebrated evolutionary biologist and popular science writer who holds the "Chair for the Public Understanding of Science" at Oxford University. Among the books he has written are "The Selfish Gene", "The Blind Watchmaker", and of course "The God Delusion" - all of them best sellers. It should be pointed out that Dawkins is an outspoken critic of "creationism" and an ardent proponent of atheism.

Dr Rowan Williams is the Archbishop of Canterbury. Wikipedia describes him as "A Churchman of considerable intellectual powers". He has published many essays on theology, divinity, and the role of the church in modern society. He is also a noted poet, and translator of Welsh poetry. Early in his career, Williams was questioned following his past involvement with a Pagan organisation. As the "Archbishop of Canterbury", he is the spritual leader of the Church of England.

Firstly, I am somewhat shocked that the Archbishop of Canterbury has felt a need to ridicule Richard Dawkins. In light of the supposed resurgence of the Church and faith in (a) god in recent years, it seems very strange.

Secondly, I was amused to read the arguments Williams put forward. Rather than compare Christian and Atheist beliefs, he side-stepped the issue at the heart of the argument. Go read it for yourself.

I've read "The God Delusion", and personally think it's a fantastic book. It's open minded, it presents opinions, views, and observations in a totally unbiased manner, and makes an awful lot of sense. Perhaps that's the reason for the attack - Dawkins book makes a bit too much sense for the Church of England's liking.

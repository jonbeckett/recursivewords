While out buying some lunch in London yesterday lunchtime I wandered into the Virgin Megastore and bought W the game she has been waiting almost 2 years for - "The Legend of Zelda - The Phantom Hourglass".

I handed the game to her a few moments after walking in the door last night, and apart from loitering in the kitchen while dinner was cooking (pumpkin risotto, which was the perfect thing after a cold day in the city), it was the last peep I heard from her for the evening.

For the first few minutes I watched over her shoulder to see just how good "Phantom Hourglass" might be - and was immediately struck by the quality of the sound and graphics. This is by far the best looking, and best sounding Nintendo DS game I have seen. Granted, it was developed by Nintendo themselves and is two years late, but the time appears to have been spent well.

I gather from the furrowed brow and look of intense concentration on her face (for several hours) that the game itself is very, very good.

Finally at about 11pm the DS was folded shut, W sat down next to me, and kissed me on the cheek. I'll have to buy her games for the DS more often.

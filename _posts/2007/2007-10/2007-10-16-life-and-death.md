While stopping for a cup of coffee earlier today I checked in to a writing group I have been fostering and was dismayed to find that somebody I thought of as experienced and wise role model had torn somebody's writing to shreds in the most calculated, cruel, and tactless display of snobbery I had ever seen on the internet.

Prior to leaving work, several of my colleagues who live in London swapped experiences of travelling home from work late - and not wanting to exit the train at particular stations on their own after dark for fear of being mugged.

While travelling home the the speakers crackled into life over the heads of the commuters beneath London and informed us that several underground lines would be subject to severe delays due to a "body on the line". Somebody killed themselves. Almost unbelievably, the majority of the people around me started cursing and complaining. Nobody expressed concern or regret.

What is happening to the world?

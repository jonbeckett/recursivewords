We started out on a great new idea last night - spending an evening each week either at our house or a friend's house playing board games - helped along with pizza, chinese takeaway, or any other easy to obtain / bad for you / tastes great food we can lay our hands on.

Last night we did the visiting, and provided the board games - in this case 'Word Blind', and 'Scattegories'.

'Word Blind' is a pretty strange game that probably appeals to the same people that like doing crossword puzzles. The cards you answer have a word on them, and a number of definitions, which are read in turn - getting easier each time. The earlier you guess the word, the more points you win. You pick up a number of board pieces matching the points you score, and lay the board out like a road as you go (so the person in the lead is making the board). The trick is that some board pieces have special functions - like allowing you to have a second go, but you have to nominate one definition... or force everybody to guess a definition at once.

It was good fun, but we were all too brain-dead to do very well - so moved on to 'Scattegories'.

Scattegories is a team game. You move round a board, and have to describe words on the cards against a sand timer without saying the word, what letter it begins with, or what it sounds like. For example - for "George Bush Jr" you might start blurting out "American war-monger president - still in power but not for much longer". It's great fun, and causes some quite, quite bizarre descriptions when you run out of ideas.

I can already see that the problem rolling into the weeks ahead is going to be finding new and fun games to play. If you have any suggestions, now is the time to start making some noise.

Here's a challenge. Ask me anything you like in the comments to this post, and I will answer in the next post.

I will try to answer all questions in a fair and truthful manner - but if they are too invasive (e.g. "can you go all night like a lumberjack"), expect an inventively sarcastic response (e.g. "yes, and I can do your housekeeper too").

p.s. you have to have seen the movie "Hot Shots" to get that joke.

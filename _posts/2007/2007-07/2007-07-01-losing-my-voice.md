Over the last few days I have struggled to find things to write about - to find my voice.

I am continually caught - there are things I would like to write about, and reservations about doing so.

While I sometimes write about our journey towards adoption I am aware that I will not be able to write about our children when they finally arrive - or at least I won't be able to say anything specific or post any pictures.

My professional life has become a complete "no go" with regards to blogging - both contractually and ethically.

This leaves me with very little to write about at present. I always fear this blog becoming just another "me me" blog. There are too many people writing self absorbed attention seeking journals on the internet - and yet in saying that, I look for the reasons I write - why I put my thoughts out there.

I have no idea why I do this. I find that I rarely have anything important to communicate - or at least if I do, other considerations preclude me from doing so.

I just got back from a 2 mile run.

If pressed, I might describe my level of fitness at the moment as somewhere similar to Homer Simpson.

I used to go running two or three times a week, running 5 or 6 miles each time. After starting up again last Friday I'm finding it hard to last for 2 miles. The end product from running isn't to lose weight - it's to change my body shape. Sitting on my backside all day, every day is turning me into Homer Simpson. I'm doing something about it before the situation becomes too dire.

I have no doubt - now I'm only working in London three days a week (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday) that the running will become easier and the results will begin to show. Of course half the problem at the moment is that I'm carrying excess weight while running, which isn't doing joints any good either.

Hopefully within a couple of weeks I'll be back on the 5 mile route, and see the results happen.

It's funny - while out running the one thing that keeps me running normally is the thought of how annoyed I will be with myself if I stop to walk. I wonder what motivation other people have?

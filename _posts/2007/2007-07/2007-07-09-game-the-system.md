I have just been taking a look at the Bloggers Choice Awards website, and never realised before that the number of votes received by the "top blogs" tails off so rapidly.

This blog - "Life and Times" - is listed under the "Geek" category, and only has 5 votes - but that elevates it to the 10th page of 68 pages.

70 votes would get it onto the front page (almost unbelievably).

I am tempted to encourage people to vote in order to "game the system", but that wouldn't be fair, would it...

I promise to write a proper blog post soon. p.s. I walked into work today - three miles with an incredibly heavy rucksack on (containing two laptops, their chargers, and clothes). If this doesn't help me lose weight, I have no idea what will. It's funny - I have a feeling that suddenly "trying" to lose weight is going to have no effect. I'm getting close to my "natural weight", so losing much now is going to be a question of either starving myself, or doing a very strenuous sport.

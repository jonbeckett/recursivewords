A few weeks ago while browsing through the book store at Paddington Station in London, I came across a book where the author had "traded up" from a paper clip to a house over the course of several hundred trades, and had written about his adventures.

It got me thinking - about how delightfully funny, and slightly eccentric it might be to attempt something similar. Perhaps make everything a little more innocent, and a little more fun though.

This is what I came up with...

Swap Everything

I have started a new blog at wordpress, called Swap Everything. To get things started, I am offering up a bag of marbles to swap, and would like people to comment with things they will swap me for it.

I will pick a winner every few weeks, and "do the swap" - and then offer up the thing I just swapped for anybody and everybody to offer swaps against. And so on. Each time a swap happens I will of course keep track in the blog of where an item came from, and where the previous item went to.

I don't want to get anything out of doing this - I just thought it might be a fun thing to do.

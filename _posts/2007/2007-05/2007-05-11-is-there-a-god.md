Something is happening to one of my friends on the other side of the world that is giving me a perfect reason to set out my stand and start arguing to anybody who wishes to have the fight with me that there is no god. No such thing. Or at least I have serious doubts.

She is trying damn hard to bring her kid up on her own, and the world, it's brother, and it's dog keeps kicking dirt in her face. Her son's father left shortly after birth after subjecting her to an abusive relationship. She then had to give up one of her children in order to keep the other, the house she rents is being sold out from under her, she desperately needs dental work that she cannot afford, and is judged by just about anybody and everybody. She tries to hold multiple jobs down to make ends meet and repeatedly ends up dropping the ball as we all would in her situation.

The real shame - for anybody that gets to know her - is that she is intelligent, wise, funny, knowledgeable, beautiful, and a fantastic friend. She also tries to believe in God - and clings on to her belief through the world of shit that has been thrown at her (for several years now). Over that time the world has become steadily worse.

This is one of those situations where religious people will claim that the events happening in her life are "god's will". If this is god's will then he, she, or it is not a very nice thing/being/f*ckwad at all. It's the equivalent of kicking somebody, then kicking somebody some more, then repeating until the job is finished.

I just hope she knows that there are people in the world that care about her - even if they are on the other side of the world and cannot easily bring pizza and a shoulder to lessen the load.

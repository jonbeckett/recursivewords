Sometimes the internet can be a very lonely place - especially when you keep in touch with most of your friends via the internet, and their names don't light up, or appear in your in-box.

This hasn't been helped by T-Mobile seemingly barring Jaiku from sending me text messages (Jaiku is a service similar to Twitter, only better).

I have now been writing a blog in one form or another for about 5 years. The press have continually stated that blogging is a fad, and that it would not survive. It has. Blogging has evolved, and expanded - there are more people sharing their life online than ever before either through blogs, instant messaging or social networks. Perhaps it's a reflection on society as a whole that we are connecting via this remote method rather than face-to-face. Who knows... we are still reaching out though, and still finding each other.

While the luddites may think of communities forged through the internet as "imaginary", the sense of remoteness experienced when your "imaginary friends" are not around is very real.

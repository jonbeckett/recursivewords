Early tomorrow morning we will leave home with a car packed full of tents, sleeping bags, waterproofs, warm clothes, walking boots, camping stove, and various other bits and pieces to travel to the Lake District for the week.

We will be staying at a camp site near Boot, about 15 miles south west of Keswick. I checked the weather last night, and it's forcast for showers throughout the entire week - but I'm hoping we will be lucky. We have re-proofed our waterproofs, and tonight I need to clean and wax our boots. We are not going to get wet.

Friends are already remarking "how will you survive without the internet?", and my answer is "very easily". I'll take a couple of good books with me, turn my phone off, and vanish. I will take the phone with me, but it will be for emergency use only.

I wonder if I can find anywhere to cut all my hair off this afternoon? I'm not looking forward to going camping with long hair.

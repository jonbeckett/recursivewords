After something in the region of 6 years I fished a sketchbook out of the attic tonight, and started drawing. I've been meaning to do this for a LONG time... and I've been intending to learn how to draw Manga characters for a very long time too.

Drawing isn't the issue for me - that's the easy bit. Drawing in the Manga style is the hard thing for me. I always used to end up drawing "real" people - they are easier because you can just look at a person to see how a part of their body should go.

Here's the result of tonight anyway - both photos taken with my camera phone, so I apologise in advance for the crappy quality...

I was just trying to figure out how to draw a Manga face - I looked at several examples, to see how they do eyes, nose, and so on - and think I got it fairly close. High tech media used was a ballpoint pen...

This is very much "work in progress" - a full figure. It's much bigger than it looks too - just fitting on a sheet of A3. I noticed in the Manga pictures I have seen that female "assets" are always exaggerated, so I did that too. Once I've added some clothes, and some big swirly hair, I'll ink it and then scan it - then try something I've only ever done once - colour it with Photoshop. If anybody has any tips, I'll be glad to hear them.

I just sat down to watch television for a bit before going to bed, and it would appear a new series of Big Brother is starting this evening in the UK.

They have filled the house with women. All women. The arguments have already started. Most of them are wannabe models, and they are furious that there are no men in the house.

One of them appears to be an "it" girl, and I confidently predict that a million 14 year old girls will use their parent's phone bills to vote her out after she started putting the knife into prettier girls within the first hour.

I have no idea if I'll see any more of Big Brother this time (hopefully not) but at least tonight was quite entertaining - but perhaps for all the wrong reasons.

Update after another 20 minutes... the house mates have had a basket of food given to them. All but one of them has left the food (much of it perishable) to go off while they drink wine. They don't care, and they probably don't know any different. They seem to have more knowledge of makeup and celebrity culture than anything useful... like surviving... making food... you know, practical things.

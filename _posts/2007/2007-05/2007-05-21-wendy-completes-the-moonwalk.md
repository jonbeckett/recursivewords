My considerably better half travelled into London on Saturday night in order to do the "Moonwalk" - a charity 26.2 mile power walk through the streets of London starting at Midnight wearing her bra to raise money for breast cancer research.

She joined fifteen thousand other women, set off at midnight, and finished shortly after 7am in the morning at Hyde Park - with many stories to tell about mismanagement, and perhaps the worst organised charity even she has ever taken part in (the Police didn't close any roads - at times it took twenty minutes to cross busy roads via normal pedestrial crossings). A great deal of her sponsorship was based on how fast she completed the course...

At the end - just to cap things off, and even though W finished very quickly indeed - there were no hot drinks left at the finish.

Good job I took a flask of tea for her.

The end result of the weekend is that breast cancer research is several hundred pounds better funded as a result of W's efforts, and neither of us have had much sleep. W of course didn't sleep at all on Saturday night - and I go about 4 hours. Myself and her Dad got up at 3:45 in order to meet W and her Mum at the finish line.

I now find myself half asleep on the train towards London, with no ticket because there has been nobody to buy one from yet. I also need to replenish my season ticket for another month - which will entail missing the train home tonight unless I leave early.

Welcome to my world.

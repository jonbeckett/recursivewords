My grand plans to use the day more productively haven't got off to a very good start - I am therefore drinking a huge cappucino in the cafe above the concorse at Paddington Station.

It all started when I got in last night. W had told some friends of hers that I would re-build their laptop for them. I started at half past seven, and finished at about eleven last night. Following that, W had asked me to help her make a webpage advertising her raffle for Breakthrough Breast Cancer. We finally went to bed at 1:30am.

The raffle is being done to raise money for breast cancer research - it's a worthy cause, so why not head on over and have a look?

The end result of doing that is that I had 4 hours of sleep last night. Not good. I can't even remember switching my alarm clock off this morning. I think it went off.

Oh well - better drink my coffee and descend into the Underground again.

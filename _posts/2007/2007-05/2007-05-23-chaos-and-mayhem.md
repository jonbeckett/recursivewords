Last night I put my "other" pair of work trousers in the dryer, and set it for 2 hours just before going to bed. This morning I checked them, and they were still damp. Great - the safety cut-off on the dryer must have kicked in and switched off the heating element.

When I get in from work tonight - at 7pm - I have no choice but to spend perhaps until 1am doing washing, drying and ironing. I am almost completely out of clean clothes, and the house is a tip. This is what happens when both of you work full time and you had one weekend where you were not here... and you were both so tired on Monday night that you didn't lift a finger to do any chores.

Our house has an evil mind all of it's own. If I don't spend the next couple of entire evenings fighting against it, the entire weekend will be lost doing it. Washing clothes. Throwing things away. Tidying things up. Taking stuff to the dump. And then it will be Monday again and it will start turning to hell once more.

It is done. I have finally finished reading the last of J.

K.

Rowling's Harry Potter books. I read the greater part of it while commuting in and out of London this week, and thoroughly enjoyed it. With reflection, I think perhaps the final book beats even "The Goblet of Fire" in my opinion as the best of the series.

I'm not going to write anything about the plot, because I think it would spoil it for those who are still reading it. I will however say that Deathly Hallows is not suitable for young children, and it became obvious while reading it that recent memory of the earlier books would have helped. It's been a long time since the last bookand I've read a lot of books in that time. A lot of good books.

Deathly Hallows finishes the series off nicely. A fitting end. I will even admit to having a tear in my eye during the final chapterbut I'm not letting on why, or what the final chapter is about.

As a series of book, I have found the Harry Potter books mixed. While continually reminding myself that they are childrens books, I found myself struggling to "be bothered" several timesperhaps most of all in the 5th bookof which the movie "Order of the Phoenix" has just been released.

In a somewhat Potter filled week, we went to the cinema on Wednesday night to see Order of the Phoenix. We had not intended to go at allI was on my way home on the train when a car hit a railway bridge somewhere further up the line. I found myself stranded in Maidenhead (many miles from home) with no trains and a queue several hundred deep for taxis. I did what any sensible person wouldI went to the pub.

It just so happens that the pub I went to is just around the corner from a multiplex cinema, so I gave W a call and she came out to go and see "something". Our choice fell between Harry Potter, Transformers and the Simpsons Movie. We chose Harry as the lesser of the three evils.

I do want to go and see Transformers though, even if the cinema will be full of men in their early 30s, probably all working in IT, some of them accompanied by their male children.

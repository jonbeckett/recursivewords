I discovered a new video podcast this morning - Webdrifter. It's part of the Revision 3 network, which also put out Diggnation and GigaOM.

The lastest episode sees the host, Martin, visit 91 year old Allen Michael - the founder of the One World Family Commune. They talk about Michael's belief that we are all derived from extra-terrestrials, and that those beings are still in contact with him today.

While the show is firmly tongue-in-cheek, I couldn't help wondering while watching it how different people would react to it. No doubt somebody with conventional religious beliefs would look down their nose at the ageing hippie in the film. They may openly criticise and/or laugh at the commune's views.

Why?

Being judgemental is not an instinctive behaviour - it is learned.

This is getting beyond a joke - I have now been ill for nearly a month and a half. I'm inclined to think that I have actually had three different colds back to back.

Why am I suddenly catching colds? I have a pretty straightforward answer - spending upwards of four hours each day crammed into a filthy train carriage with several hundred similarly ill people. It became pretty obvious on Monday when I cycled to the normal office for the first time in six months; a few miles of fresh air being rammed into my nose and mouth made me feel better than I have in weeks. Of course, at 6am the next morning I found myself back on a train.

Yesterday evening while walking through the kitchen I coughed violently and nearly passed out. On the train this morning I nearly passed out again, and contemplated turning around and coming home. I carried on.

Tonight we have a meeting with the adoption services. Tomorrow night we are supposed to be going to W's work Christmas party. On Friday a lorry load of dirt will be delivered to fill the pond in with. We also have a gate to fit onto the side of the house this weekend, and a bathroom to finish decorating.

Where's that switch that makes the world stop for a while?

The stress of the adoption process, allied with commuting, work, and just about everything at the moment seems to be contributing to the most prolongued illness I have had in my entire life.

People talk about being "run down", don't they. I think I know what they are talking about now.

The long hair that once adorned my head has now gone. Consigned to history. A footnote in my life story.

The lady that cut my hair at 9:30 this morning seemed genuinely worried about what she was doing. I have gone from shoulder length caveman locks to what you can see in the photo above. There was an impressive mess on the floor of the salon afterwards... the scissor lady piped up "I'm going to leave that there because it makes me look like I've been really busy".

There is a practical side to the haircut too. I have a new mountain bike. Long hair and bike helmets do not go together. You end up with a sweaty, tangled mess after a few miles.

For those with an interest in all things two-wheeled and pedal powered, it's a GT hard tail, with disc brakes, rock shocks, and a pretty good Shimano group set on it. After my old bike (an ancient Scott), it's remarkably light. I'm still wallowing in the novelty of front shocks that actually seem to work.

God knows what my colleagues in London will think when I walk in tomorrow morning minus my "alternative" look. I'll have to find some other way to rebel against the cloned look of most commuters. Perhaps I'll read Manga books on the train.

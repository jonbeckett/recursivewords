I don't normally take part in Memes, but seeing as this was passed on by Ashley, who's blog I like rather a lot, I thought it might serve as a good distraction.

7 Random Facts

I am red-green colourblind. While this didn't stop me breezing my way through art at college, it does mean that I pick up the blue shirt when W asks for the purple one. They look the same to me.

I can remember the quadratic formula. I have never had occaision to use it since leaving college, but I may do one day. You never know! (in plain english, it reads : minus b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus 4ac, all divided by 2a).

I once got so drunk that I was found in the back garden curled up around the base of the washing line by my Mum - in the rain.

I love playing Chess, but know I am never going to be any better than I already am at it - mainly because I can't be bothered to put the time and effort in. I feel the same way about lots of pursuits.

When I was five years old I tried to flush our fully grown cat down the toilet. She survived for decades, and fulfilled her twilight years by shitting in my bedroom.

I spend most of my life trying to make other people happy. It's not a conscious decision - I do it automatically, and it regularly gets me into trouble (the old "you can't please all the people all the time" maxim).

We never had a computer when I was a little kid. I was at least 13 by the time a proper computer arrived in our house. Until then my brother had an Atari 2600 which I wasn't interested in at all (my time seems to have been filled with climbing trees, and riding my bike all over town to visit friends).

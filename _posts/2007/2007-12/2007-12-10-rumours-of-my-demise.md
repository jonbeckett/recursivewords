The reason for so few blog posts - and so few comments from me on other's blogs over the last several days - has been the finale in the saga of my body's defences versus every cold and cough type virus in Great Britain trying to attack me.

It would appear (and I don't want to tempt fate) that I am finally getting better.

The worst point was probably last Friday - when I was coughing so violently it gave me a headache so bad I didn't know what to do with myself. My body effectively shut down in the early afternoon - I went to bed with my clothes on after lunch, and didn't wakeup until lunchtime on Saturday.

The weekend basically didn't happen for me. I spent most of it coughing, unblocking my nose, taking headache tablets, or sleeping.

It's now Monday night, after another day spent huddled up in the warm (apart from a trip into sub-zero town earlier for food - cheers to whoever invents the weather), I am contemplating returning to work tomorrow. This entails bringing some of our house back online - like ironing some clothes, packing my work bag, and so on. It's going to take most of the evening. Neither of us has done any of our "normal routine" for days while we have been ill.

At the moment we are both on the maximum dosage of over-the-counter cold and flu remedies. In combination with lucozade and cough medicine, it seems to be working slowly.

I have never been ill for so long in my entire life. November hasn't really happened - or the start of December. We have done nothing to prepare for Christmas yet. The decorations are still in the attic. It doesn't even feel like Christmas.

Tomorrow morning I face something of a vertical hill. I'll be back at work with a week and a half until the end of my contract. There will be problems to solve, documentation to write, and handovers to prepare. I need to be well. I haven't been for well over a month. I need a clear head. I need energy and drive. Quite where I'm going to find them are anybody's guess.

For some reason, Christmas isn't happening in our house. Neither of us have any will to do anything remotely connected with Christmas. We're wondering if it's because all of our attention, effort, money and thought has been directed into the adoption journey over the last few months - which will all happen of course after Christmas.

We haven't got any decorations out yet, and have only today begun Christmas shopping. On the way home W held my leg and said "cheer up?". I hadn't realised I had been down, but I still have this cough (7 weeks, and counting), and I guess it's sucking the fun out of me.

I haven't bought W anything for Christmas yet. I either have to order something off the internet tonight - and pray it arrives in time - or go out in London at lunchtime this week and find her something. I have NEVER been this unprepared for Christmas before.

We even had a conversation earlier about not putting any decorations up this year - we are not going to be here either at Christmas or New Year. It seems a bit pointless to put lots of things up when we are only going to be here for a couple of days. We finally decided to put a tree up on Tuesday.

While Christmas shopping earlier, we picked up "Guitar Hero". I'm not going to try and describe it - I'll let you watch this YouTube video instead...

I'll post a photo of W stood in the middle of our lounge with the Guitar soon. It is a sight to behold.

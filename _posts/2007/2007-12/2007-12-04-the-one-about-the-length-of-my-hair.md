Following a request to put up images comparing the various lengths of my hair over the last two years, I put together a "montage" of sorts.

At the top left we have long the first time around - summer 2006. Top right is summer 2007. Bottom left is late autumn 2007, and bottom right is present day.

It's worth pointing out that my hair is now the length it has been for years up until I let it grow out over the last couple of years. I'm probably never going to do it again because it's way too much hassle. I was getting through a huge bottle of conditioner every week, and it still looked a complete mess most days.

Time spent in the bathroom on a morning has reduced from half an hour down to ten minutes - purely because I have (nearly) no hair to wash and dry now.

Most amusing comment so far has been from our friend's little girl, who thought I should shave it all off.

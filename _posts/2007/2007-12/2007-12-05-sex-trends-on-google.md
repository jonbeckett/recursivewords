Give me ten minutes free time on the internet, and look what I come up with. I typed the word "sex" into Google Trends to see how often it gets searched for on the internet (hint : ten times more than "Britney" or "Paris").

Here's the results...

At first glance, it doesn't look that special. There are a few spikes. I started comparing it against various celebrity names to see if the spikes correlated (adding the usual celebrity suspects to the mix). No dice.

Then I noticed that the spikes are at christmas time every year. What on earth is going on? It would appear that searches on Google for the word "sex" go up dramatically at the end of each year. Surely this can't all be husbands searching for "sexy underwear" for their better halves?

Any ideas?

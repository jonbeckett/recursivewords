We are both at home ill now, and made to feel even worse by the knowledge that we missed W's work's christmas party last night - which was held at Pinewood studios in among all the James Bond props. Dress code was formal. Apparently it was a brilliant night.

I'm totally blaming the London Underground for both of us being ill. I have never been as frequently ill as I have been during my stay in London in my entire life. We both have continual headaches. We both ache all over from continually coughing. Neither of us has slept properly for days.

Last night I lent down to pick up a cup off the floor - and my nose filled with snot in about a quarter of a second. And you know all these lozenge type things they advertise on television? They are all crap.

That's all I have to say about that.

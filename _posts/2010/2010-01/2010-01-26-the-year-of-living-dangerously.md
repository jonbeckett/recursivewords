Today marks both the end of something, and the beginning of something new.

Today marks the beginning of a real, proper blog. The beginning of an effort to regularly expound words of interest to the passing crowd from a platform built of the best virtual boxwood (in reality it's built on Apache, PHP, MySQL and WordPress, but that doesn't have the same ring to it).

With a little luck, and a little effort, "Cheese and Beans" will become a regular literary performance charged with humility, honesty, wit, intelligence, eccentricity, annoyance, aggravation, hilarity, and perhaps an occasional spoon of levity.

I will screw my courage to the sticking place, and set about deconstructing the walls I have built over recent years; walls that conceal the real story. The interesting story. The story never told. The dark thoughts, the idiotic opinions, the damn fool escapades, and the inappropriate situations.

I'm not saying I'll be leaving to fight in a foreign civil war, contract syphilis in Venice, or wooing statesmen's wives (as a certain famous literary figure did a few hundred years ago), but I might at least have very pointed things to say about the school run, idiot car drivers, old people, religious zealots, and the remarkably interesting statistical relationship between the size of the hole in the o-zone layer, and the number of Pirates in the world.

I will encourage you, my audience, as you accompany me on this journey of discovery - we will come to know each other, you and I, to laugh, to commiserate, and to share confidences.

It's going to be fun. It's also going to be difficult, but mostly fun, on the whole, I think...

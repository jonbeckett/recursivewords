In mid February, my iPhone contract runs out - I am therefore starting to think about what I will do. Anybody who knows me (in the real world) will know I have not been the biggest fan of the iPhone for quite some time;My main issues with the iPhone are; The O2 network in the UK is pretty poorThe unlimited data plan is expensiveBattery life is pathetic - I have to charge my iPhone 3G every night The camera is very poorThe handset is fragile - I am on my second 3G handset; wireless has broken on both of themGoogle Mail only supports push by simulating Microsoft ExchangeApple rule their walled garden like Nazis It's not all doom and gloom though;The iPhone user interface is still much better than anything else on the marketiTunes integration is naturally very, very goodThe various Twitter and Facebook applications are very good The decision over what to do comes down to a few observations of what I use a phone for these days - having owned an iPhone for the last 18 months, the novelty of being able to run all manner of crap on my phone has pretty much gone; I would rather have a phone that does a few core things well. I would like a phone that has the following; Good battery lifeAn inexpensive data planGood email clientGood task list applicationGood SMS clientGood cameraGood social network client (Twitter and Facebook) I'm seriously considering a Blackberry. If I switch to Vodaphone it will be a third cheaper than an iPhone each month, the handset will be free, the camera will be better, and it will have akeyboardappears to be the first goodopen platform for mobile devices. What to do... what to do...

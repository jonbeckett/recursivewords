The next sentence is going to cause a number of people to slap their own foreheads with their hands - perhaps the entire readership - you know, all six of you. I'm just warning you in advance so you don't try and blame me for personal injury.

I'm considering buying a domain name and webspace to build a "proper" blog.

If I'm going to live up to my word and put effort into the words I share, I may as well attempt to do soproperly.This whole crackpot plan will of course mean moving everything again, and will probably cause a number of people who have half heartedly followed my various utterings to throw their arms in the air, and wander off to do something more interesting - you know, like cutting their toenails.

A little voice on one of my shoulders is shouting something about the platform not being important. Apparently it's all about content - or rather words - and they better be damn interesting if an audience is going to be enticed towards them.

I have no problem writing - with a little application I know damn well I can compose far better words than I typically spew out.

If I do this, I'm going to have to lower my guard significantly. People are most interested inreally weird shit - the deep, dark thoughts you wouldn't normally share. The controversial opinions. The personality hatchet jobs you might normally keep to yourself. Without the honesty, the words lose their power, and the story becomes mundane.

I'm aware that since having children I've been busily building walls. Those will have to come down. If I do get the wrecking ball out, it will be scary as hell to start with, but might also be rather fun.

Oh crap. If I do this, I have to think of a name...

After much thought and deliberation - at least a twenty minutes during the cycle home from work - I have decided that it might be prudent to resurrect "cheeseandbeans.com", which I already own.Truth be told, I can't think up a better name than "Cheese and Beans"

"kingoftheidiots.com" is available, if you're interested, as is "secondtotheleft.com"

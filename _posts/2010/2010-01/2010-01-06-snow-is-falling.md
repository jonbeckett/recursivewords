I'm working from home today. On reflection this morning I probably couldhave walked the 3 miles across the fields to work, but knowing that further heavy snow was forecast throughout the entire day, and that I have a cold already, I didn't fancy trudging home through it. I can work at home pretty much unimpeded, which makes the decision much easier than it might have been.

While we all know that advertising standards exist for a reason, I can't help thinking that advertisements were better when the world was morenaive, even if they were all full of shit.

I'm guessing the message this Pepsi advert communicates is that if you have a James Bond physique, and walk the beach with your frogman kit, you will invariably happen upon any number of catwalk model types of easy virtue, who you will easily impress as they stand, legs apart, quaffing fizzy drinks until their teeth fall out.

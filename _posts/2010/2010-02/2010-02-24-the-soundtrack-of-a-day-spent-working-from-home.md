After a steady decline through yesterday afternoon and evening, I woke this morning with rather more aches and pains than I normally have - the kind that normally accompany some virus or other. Given the advance warning (and the absence of colleagues for the same reason in recent days), I worked from home. Working from home releases me from the silent world of the office and allows a soundtrack for the day. The only question therefore was what to listen to.

I decided - after at least half a minute's thought - to give Katherine Jenkins another try. She became incredibly famous during the time I worked in London - her face (and body) were emblazoned across billboards all over the city for months. She appeared from time to time on television - singing at New Year, at big football matches, and on various television chat shows. I hated her. Sure, she's beautiful, but much of the time I thought she sounded like a trumpet rammed up a very large nose.

Perhaps I know nothing about classical music. Perhaps I have no clue what a mezzo-soprano is supposed to sound like ?

This morning I downloaded the "Believe" album, principally because I listened to a sample on Amazon of the track "Bring Me To Life", and realised that she didn't always sound like a trumpet jammed up a very large nose. When she sings away from those particular registers, she sounds lovely. Wonderful even.

So - I'm not converted, but I am enjoying the album.

As an insurance policy I also got hold of some Tony Bennett, and confidently predict I'll be forcing it on the kids later. I'm often aware that the children like any music, so if I can use that opportunity to expose them to some of the great talents, then I will do so.

Work went okay too

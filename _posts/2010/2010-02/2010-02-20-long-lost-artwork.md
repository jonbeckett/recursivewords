While rooting around for something in our bookshelves yesterday I found an old sketchbook tucked down the back of a row of books - a sketchbook I had presumed lost years ago. Here are a few of the sketches I did 11 years ago;

I'm just trying to remember where I was, and what I would have been doing 11 years ago. 1999. I still lived with my parents in Oxfordshire, and worked for a local company as their IT manager. The drawings were probably done around the same time that I started attending night classes to force myself into drawing more (an attempt that lasted about a month).

We also unearthed all my childhood school books and christmas cards last night - I'll post a few of them up over the coming days.

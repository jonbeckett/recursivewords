In a stunningly transparent example of the hilariously shallow nature of the global geek army spread throughout the internet , I would like to report that whereas I have had a tiny trickle of new Twitter followers in recent days, I have had so many new Google Buzz followers that I don't know what to do with them.

I'm guessing the focus of the feeding frenzy is going to switch today towards lusting after Windows 7 Mobile Series - the long dumped on "next generation" phone operating system from the Redmond behemoth. The very same analysts, pundits and "technologists" (arf!) that proclaimed the iPhone as the second coming are now roundly denouncing it as old, staid, and decrepit.

Twitter exploded with a thousand technology commentators salivating over Windows 7 Mobile earlier - convulsing to be the first to report its arrival. Why they all had to chip in is anybody's guess - a bit like cheering "hooray!" thirty seconds after a goal is scored in a football match.

The gadget fanboy crowd both annoy me and amuse me at the same time - it's like they are all stood in a sweet shop where a new bag of sweets is dropped in through a hole in the roof every so often - and they collectively drop whatever they were eating, and run after the new tasty thing immediately, licking their lips as they go.

Even worse, the fanboy crowd start rumors among themselves about the purported features of new bags of sweets yet to fall... "they say the next bag is made of unicorn wings!"... "oooOOOoo"... "and it cures webbed feet too!"

Ho hum. Perhaps I'm just getting old and cynical. Having already ditched my iPhone, I took one look at the Windows 7 prototype and thought "I bet it doesn't last until lunchtime on a single charge".

Yep - I am quite the curmugeon.

In my valentine card for my other half (which I don't actually agree with buying, but convention forces me to), I wrote "thankyou for putting up with me being such a grumpy old git - signed Mr Grumpy Pants".

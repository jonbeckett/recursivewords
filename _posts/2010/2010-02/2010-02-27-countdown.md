I just caught our youngest stood on a foot stool alongside the toilet, doing a very loud and enthusiastic Thunderbirds style count-down towards flushing it.

As she pushed the lever she bellowed "BLAST OFF!" at the top of her voice.

She then spotted me watching her in the doorway and slid down looking very guilty.

I never said a word.

While attempting to catch up on the increasingly worrisome mountain of unread blogs that cast a dark shadow over much of my online presence, I read something interesting. I would like to share it, but cannot remember for the life of me who wrote it, or where it came from.

The basic recollection is that the person in question had drawn a line through their blog at some point in their past, and consigned the pre-written archive to history. They had not disposed of the words, so much as packed them in mothballs.

I have been wondering if I should do the same - draw a line. Although I have an archive page, I wonder what utility it really serves, aside from providing stalkers or obsessed morons an opportunity to dig through my every published thought in search of ammunition for some kind of idiotic feud.

In among the vast collection of garbage - and let's face it, most of it is garbage - there are odd posts that would be of interest to others. While talking to a friend online earlier, it became obvious that the various posts I wrote throughout our IVF and adoption journey would be invaluable for others treading the same path.

The rest of my writing is invariably crap though. Not worth recalling. The narcisistic ramblings of tired Mondays, grumpy commuting, and wasted weekends.

In the same way that print publications sometimes unearth historical articles, I could re-visit my thoughts from years past and make them fresh again. A conversation of sorts with my past self.

Drawing a line seems like a brave thing to do though, and I'm not altogether sure it's the best thing to do. Is the internet about the present, or the past ? Reflecting on the past seems like a rather introspective activity, and while it's good to look back and learn, it's also exciting to look forward with anticipation.

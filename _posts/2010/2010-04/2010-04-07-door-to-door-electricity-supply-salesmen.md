We just had a guy turn up at the door selling electricity. Only he wasn't of course. He was conducting a door-to-door survey on behalf of Scottish Power to make sure people were paying the correct tariff after "numerous" local complaints about the tariff people have been paying for their electricity and gas supplies. Yeah right.

Horseshit.

In somewhat bizarre fashion I opened the door, and there was nobody stood there. He walked sideways into view. Now don't get me wrong, but if you don't want to be trusted from the first moment I see you, that's the perfect way to do it, moron. You've already picked the worst time possible (the moment I've arrived home from work) - no doubt praying on those that will say anything to get rid of you because they are cooking dinner, and don't want to offend you by shutting the door in your face.

Before he started speaking, I started the conversation for him...

"We are not interested in changing our power supply"

He smiled, closed his eyes, and tried to gesture that I had got it all wrong. He trotted out the survey story.

"I'm sorry, I don't believe you. Anyway - I have nothing to do with paying the bills in this house - I go to work, my other half does the paperwork. She's not in. Bad luck."

He was a bit lost for words (amazing!), so I said goodbye and shut the door in his face.

Aaarrrgggghhh!

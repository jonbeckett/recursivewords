Our youngest received money from "Grandad at the Seaside" for her birthday - yesterday was her first chance to spend it. Little did we know that we would be bringing another person into the house.

We are reliably informed that he is a boy monster, and his name is "Big Blue One". He likes being tickled, likes tickling people, and causes endless hilarity around the house with his antics.

I expect he will be visiting family very soon to wreak havoc.

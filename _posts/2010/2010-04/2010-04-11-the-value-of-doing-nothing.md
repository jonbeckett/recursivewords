"Doing nothing" is a misnomer, isn't it. There's no such thing as "doing nothing". Our hearts keep beating, our lungs keep inflating, and our nails keep growing.

While I might think I've been "doing nothing" today, in reality I've been up to all sorts...

Got up and put groceries away (that arrived late last night after the nice supermarket delivery man went above and beyond the call of duty to deliver to us at about 10:45pm).

Did washing up and tidied the kitchen up while listening to MacBreak weekly, and passed time of day with W's brother who stayed over last night.

Had a shower, brushed teeth, de-smelled myself, and attempted to rejoin the civilised human race once more

Took younger children for wander into town to buy a birthday present for a party this afternoon, and some toothpaste.

Also bought a frisbee, badminton rackets, foam rocket launcher, and ball game (it's sunny out, and the outdoor stuff is still cheap in the shops)

Ran around the garden like a lunatic playing football, frisbee, and dodging the foam rocket - much to the hilarity of the girls.

Ran around the green in front of our house like a lunatic - throwing, catching and running after the frisbee with the girls. Attempts to teach the younger children to throw it "properly" were at least partially successful.

In-between all of these various activities I picked away at a web development thing called "CakePHP". I won't describe it much further than that for fear of sending you to sleep - but I will mention that it allows you to "bake" websites. That appeals to me somehow.

While messing with the computer, I reminded myself how much I like Jean Michel Jarre, Leigh Nash, and Lene Marlin.

So you see, although I report "doing nothing" today, in reality I've done nothing of the sort.

It's now 5pm and I'm not entirely sure where the day has gone. I promise to have something more thoughtful to write about soon. This post feels like some kind of bizarre "check in" with star command.

Today I lifted the world onto my shoulders (figuratively speaking), arranged it into a configuration of my choosing, and set it down again.

You're probably wondering what on earth I am talking about. I've been working on something incredibly complex all day long, and rather than explain any of it to you - which might induce a sudden attack of narcalepsy - I thought it best to dress up my struggles in some kind of literary analogy.

In essence; it was difficult, I figured it out, therefore I rock.

Rather than spend another evening continuing to headbang, I figured a night off might be in order. For anybody else (and me, several nights ago), this would mean rubbish television, alcohol, and junk food. This evening you find me downloading the latest build of Ubuntu, reading blogs, writing this, and thinking about playing a video game.

Would you believe I haven't played any video games in months? I've not even picked up the DS. It's time I re-acquainted myself with Ratchet and Clank, Jak and Daxter, and Mario.

Finally taking a night off from development work. Listening to podcasts, scribbling in my notebook. Life is good.

I wish I had something insightful and somewhat thoughtful to expound about, but there really isn't much in my head at the moment.

I'm sat here listening to Macbreak weekly (a fantastic podcast) - they are talking about the Apple engineer who "lost" a next generation iPhone prototype while celebrating his birthday. Turns out the story more complex that it first appears. The phone was stolen - not lost. This is where it gets interesting - Gawker Media, owners of Gizmodo, bought the stolen phone. Under California law that lands them in a world of brown smelly stuff.

Knowing that there is a new iPhone coming is interesting - and possibly changes the story for all competing phones over the next year or two. The lost iPhone had front and rear cameras, high resolution screen (double the existing one), and far more industrial design. I'm thinking this is the business iPhone that would kill the Microsoft and RIM market stone dead.

Anyway. Enough thought about technology. Earlier this evening I sat and watched the first half of "My Neighbour Totoro" again. It's an interesting movie - the more times I watch it, the more impressed I become with it. There is so much hidden away in the behaviour of the children in the story - so much thought and observation wrapped up in their creation. Now I want to go back and watch some of the other Ghibli movies with fresh eyes.

Perhaps this "Sunday evening off" should become a rule around here.

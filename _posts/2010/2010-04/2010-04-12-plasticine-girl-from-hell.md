Shortly before leaving work this evening my other half called my mobile. I noticed it vibrating, and picked it up just in time to hear the following...

... yes, he has it on his desk on silent, because the people he works with get really annoyed with the sound of message alerts all the time

At the end of the sentence I said "hello" 

We were invited for dinner at friends just around the corner from us, and after dinner were roped into helping make plasticine figures from some kind of animation kit that they are helping to do the marketing for. The photo-shoot happens tomorrow with their kids.

Knowing that I went to art college once upon a time, I was instructed to make a pretty little girl. The photo above was the result of at least ten minutes hard work.

Isn't she beautiful?

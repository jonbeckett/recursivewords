I forgot to report this one - I got told off on the way to school this morning by another parent. Shouted at. W didn't hear because she was busy dealing with our eldest who was doing her best to appear sick to avoid another day of school.

Backstory - our youngest learned to ride a bicycle about a month ago. She learned on a bike so small she looked like a clown riding it - knees around her chin, pedals whizzing round like a sewing machine. The advantage of the small bike was she could plant her feet when things got out of control (which they did/do every half a minute).

So - she falls off this bike several times a day. Every day. Her knees look like a map of the world made out of scabs. If she doesn't notice the blood, she doesn't mind, and carries on with whatever she is doing.

This morning we had got perhaps a third of the way to school, and met another parent (from the same school) who was overtaking our gaggle of kids. I say gaggle - it's more a random assortment of stress, untidiness, and mayhem - you try arranging three opinionated little madams before 8 in the morning.

Cue Little Miss 5 falling off her bike.

I walk over, and pick her up bodily by her upper arm (through a thick coat - it was damn cold this morning). Helper Mum doesn't really help, but does notice Little Miss 5's knees, and is somewhat shocked.

"THERE'S GOING TO BE NOTHING LEFT OF HER KNEES!"

I'm sorry?

This little girl started life with us having no balance what-so-ever because she had been strapped in a buggy from birth. She could hardly walk. She now runs everywhere (admittedly out of control), pushes her TWO WHEELED scooter at breakneck speed, climbs climbing frames, and CAN RIDE A BIKE at FIVE (if you want to be pedantic, she could ride a bike at four!).

Of course I said nothing in defence of our willingness to let the kids hurt themselves to a certain extent. It doesn't mean I wasn't angry though.

We don't push our kids - we encourage them. There's an old saying that we adhere to most of the time - you've not had fun unless you come home muddy, bruised, or battered. Yes, Little Miss 5 did cry this morning - but only after she noticed the blood, which Mrs Helpful pointed out.

For what it's worth, Little Miss 5 rode all the way home from school without a single accident. Take that Mrs Perfect Mom with kids who have never got dirty (probably).

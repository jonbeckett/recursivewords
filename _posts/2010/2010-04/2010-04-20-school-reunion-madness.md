While taking a few minutes out at lunchtime today, I checked Facebook and discovered a message about the laughable attempts to organise a school reunion of my year, and the year that followed. I say laughable because it's already fallen through at least twice, and has now moved dates several times.

Today brought the funniest message yet...

please could you let me know if you are intending to bring partners with you

Ahem. It was supposed to be a School Reunion - when were partners ever invited? Quite apart from causing all kinds of confusion with people thinking "wow - can't remember half these people!", I really just don't get it.

I'm guessing partners are being allowed because a vocal minority are either incredibly untrusting of their other half, or insanely jealous of anybody who might have ever known their other half.

It's ridiculous, and just shows that some people never grow up - and then wonder why they have so few friends.

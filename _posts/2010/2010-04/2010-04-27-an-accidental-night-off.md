Throughout the recent overtime madness I have been subjecting myself to, I have been working on a laptop with a "virtual machine" running on an external hard drive. The idea behind the external drive is speed - running a pretend computer inside your own requires serious resources, and the hard drive is the thing that gets it worst.

So - to work from home you need a laptop and your external drive. I brought the laptop home from work. I didn't bring the external drive home.

Oops.

So - I get an unexpected night off. While I'm happy that I get a chance to write a blog post (you're reading it!), have a drink, and chill out with rubbish TV, I am also aware that I've lost several hours of development time. It's a no-win.

A voice on my shoulder keeps trying to tell the more rational side of my head that a night off will be good - that it's time I had a break.

I forsee an evening sat on the couch, eating rubbish, coveting my Macbook, and reading all your blogs. Feel free to give me a shout.

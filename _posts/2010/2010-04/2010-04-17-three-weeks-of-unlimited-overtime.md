There will be very little in the way of deep insightful posts from me over the next three weeks (not that there ever is anyway). I have been given approval for unlimited overtime over the next three weeks in order to deliver a project on-time.

I'm not going to make comment about the factors that contributed to it happening in a public forum. I am going to thank my wonderful other half, and whoever says "hello" from time to time over the coming weeks. I'm basically going to be camped out in front of the computer at home every evening, and every weekend. At least I'm being paid for it.

If you're wondering why I'm writing this now, and not working - I'm waiting for my work laptop to defrag. It just mysteriously slowed to a crawl, so I thought I should investigate.

I really have nothing to report of any interest, and don't anticipate having anything else beyond my work to report any time soon.

The shorter form of the lifestream will probably suit me more over the coming weeks - so if you really want to stalk me, that will be the place to do it.

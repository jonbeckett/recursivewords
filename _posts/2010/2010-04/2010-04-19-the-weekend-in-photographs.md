I just found time at work to stop for something to eat, and to splurge something into here.

Apart from Saturday, which found me locked away in a dark room with my laptop for much of the day (as will be the case for several weeks to come), the rest of the weekend was absolutely fantastic. The weather was kind to us, and we survived 12 little people charging around our garden, celebrating the occasion of our youngest turning 5.

I lose count of the hours I spend scribbling while listening to things. My notepads at work invariably end up looking like the genius plans of a lunatic while sat on conference calls.

At home the moleskine gets scrawled in - usually while catching up on podcasts, or sat quietly after the kids have gone to bed.

After staying at home yesterday with a virus, I ventured back into the office this morning. Upon watching the beads of sweat running from my hair, one of my colleagues asked if I was running a fever...

"Um... yeah."

I will admit that thoughts went through my head this morning about my own idiocy. I had a fleece zipped up one minute, and stripped back to a t-shirt minutes later. The irony of choosing to wear the Superman t-shirt wasn't lost on me.

After writing a thousand lines or so of Javascript for a top secret project, I looked up and discovered that it was home time. On my way out of the building, I noticed it was raining outside - and had been doing so for hours.

Arriving at home in a somewhat bedraggled state, the children took no notice of me what-so-ever. W made a few veiled threats in their direction while I shed backpack, waterproofs, and helmet in the study. While depositing them atop the heap of stuff that will one day fall over and bury whoever is sitting at the desk, I noticed a new parcel.

Our eldest daughter is away this week on her first residential trip with school - four days away from home, with her entire year group and many teachers.

I noticed this evening how quiet the house seems; it's interesting how different the dynamic is without her.

We haven't really worried about her in the way many other parents perhaps are with their children; we have always encouraged all three of our children to stand on their own two feet (although usually with us watching - unknown to them - from the wings). We have camped out together, walked in the woods together, played in the dark, stayed away from home...

We're terrifically proud of her growing independence, and confident that she will be fine. It doesn't stop us wondering how she is though, hoping she is having fun, and not missing home too much.

We're expecting letters home later in the week.

Arrived home from client site at 12:30am last night (or should that be "this morning"?), after a 5 hour trip across the country.

Clothes are still in our kitchen, in the suitcase. I'm guessing I won't get as far as putting them through the washing machine until the weekend.

Being pulled in several directions at once at work. Will write more later.

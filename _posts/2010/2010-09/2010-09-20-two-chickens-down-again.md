Our spectacularly bad record keeping chickens continued earlier tonight.

With the arrival of colder weather, we removed the fence from the chicken run at the end of the garden this week. Two days in, two of our four chickens are dead.We're pretty sure it wasn't a fox - We found their bodies in the grass - one of them still barely alive. We've seen what a fox is capable of.

There have been several big cats in the neighbourhood recently - we're wondering, given the dark, and more opportunity to sneak up on the chickens - that this might have been the work of cats. There was no outward signs of damage on the chickens; it was like they had been scared to death.

Guess who drew the short straw and had to dispose of their remains...

At first we thought all of them had been killed, but then W found one hiding next to the house, and another arrived out of the undergrowth half an hour later.

I'm guessing tomorrow morning will involve a trip to the local farm for W to get a couple more; we're not going to tell the children until the replacements are already here.

Over the past several months I have been experimenting, playing, exploring, and basically screwing around with all manner of social networking and blogging solutions. Along the way, I've pretty much nailed down the four services that really matter;

Twitter - the here and now

Tumblr - the inspiration and insightful

WordPress - the thoughtful and introspective

Facebook - the friends, family, and colleagues

I've laughingly begunreferringto the above quartet as "the four cornered triangle of the blogopalypse". Everything else is pretty much useless for my use case.

Although I have named "WordPress", it could easily by supplanted by Blogger, Squarespace, Posterous, or Typepad based on the user in question - people choose these platforms based on their ownpreference(or ignorance, or indifference). The important point is that the content of traditional blogs stands the test of time - when you post a tweet, you're spitting into a rainstorm when you post a tumblog, you're tipping coffee into the bath when you write a blog post, you're adding a page to a book that other's may discover for years to come.

I've not talked about Facebook. It's no different than twitter really - except instead of everybody being in the rainstorm, you are segregated into houses with no roof - the spit you contribute goes through the floor and is forgotten just as quickly as if you were stood in the street.

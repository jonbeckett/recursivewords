While commuting into and out of London throughout much of 2007 and 2008, I became a regular listener of several podcasts. The bug has stayed with me, and I often choose them over television on an evening.

The podcasts being automagically piped down to my MP3 player are (in no particular order)...

Buzz Out Loud

FLOSS Weekly

BBC Friday Night Comedy

The Tech Guy

Linux Outlaws

Mac Break Weekly

Net at Night

Tech News Today

This Week in Google

This Week in Tech

Windows Weekly

Over the entire time I have been listening to podcasts, by far my favourite was theLUG Radio Podcast - which unfortunately ceased to exist in 2008. It was easily the most interesting, funniest, and most opinionated podcast of them all - search for it on the net, and enjoy.

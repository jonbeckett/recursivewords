I just caught myself looking at a Yoyo on Amazon, and nearly buying it. What on earth was I doing. Suddenly the thought of taking up this kids toy as a stress relieving hobby began to appeal to me - a way to leave my desk and go do something completely unrelated for a few minutes.

Perhaps it isn't such a bad idea, but I need to find something a little less... how do we put this? Geeky?

(this is where everybody shouts "But you're the biggest geek I know! This is perfect for you!").

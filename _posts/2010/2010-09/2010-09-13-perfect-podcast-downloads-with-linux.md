If using Windows, I would have perhaps looked at WinAmp - which will handle the download of podcasts now, but does so in a rather half baked manner. I also looked at GPodder for Linux, which is very, very good - but lacks one feature that I want; it can't delete podcasts older than a certain date.

Downloads all new episodes from the podcasts I specify in the config file

Delete all episodes older than N days

Copy all episodes to the MP3 player

While reading the blog of a good friend late last night, it occurred to me that I've written very little about myself for rather a long time. Rather than dream up some atrophy inducing journal of the recent past, I set out across the barren wastes of the internet to find questions - good questions - which I might answer in a random, and hopefully entertaining manner. I should perhaps warn you that I have one hundred of these questions, but will only subject you to ten at a time.

You might call this a lazy way to write a blog post, but in the absence of anybody remotely interested in my life that might volunteer questions (I know this to be the case - I invited questions on Tumblr some time ago), it's as good as it's going to get.

Enjoy 

"Of those, some 35,000, fully 10% lost their lives" - from "First Man, the Life of Neil Armstrong" by James R Hansen - talking about his family coming from Ohio, where 10% of the population were killed in the American Civil War. It's a fantastic book, and gives a real insight into the first man to walk on the Moon.

Stretch your left arm out as far as you can, What can you touch?

While stretching my arm out across the darkness of the study, my hand blundered into a metal tin that once held a "Jamie Oliver" mug that I received for Father's Day some time ago, emblazoned with "Top Dad". The tin is now full of spare change, which accumulates because I was bought a wallet for a present once upon a time - that I still use - that has no room for coins. Therefore my pockets get emptied every time I walk into the house.

Before you started this survey, what were you doing?

Listening to "Buzz Out Loud" and "Tech News Today", which I began listening to while washing up the dinner things. Once I finished, I wandered into the study to catch up on email, and write a blog post.

What is the last thing you watched on TV?

After finishing work on a freelance project at about 1:30am the night before last (or is that this morning?), I switched the TV on in the lounge for a few minutes to try and empty my head of all things work related, and ended up watching the second half of the movie "The Girl in the Park". Got completely sucked in by it, and only realised what the time was when I got into bed, and looked at the bedside clock... nearly 3am!

Without looking, guess what time it is

Right now, about 8:30pm perhaps?

Now look at the clock. What is the actual time?

Ok. It's 9pm. Shows how bad I am at keeping track of time when I'm absorbed in something. I even thought I was over-estimating when I said 8:30pm...

With the exception of the computer, what can you hear?

In the distance, I can hear a car accelerating through town. I can hear my own fingers drumming on the keyboard (a stock Dell keyboard that came with the Inspiron under the desk). There is a gentle hum from the computer under the desk - the laptop which is also on is silent. Now and again the heating makes a creaking noise - we've turned the heat up tonight for the first time tonight - Autumn is definitely on its way.

When did you last step outside? What were you doing?

I arrived home from work on my mountain bike at about 6pm. Work (when I'm in the office) is about 3 miles away. The bike keeps me fit - given than I would otherwise sit on my backside all day and all evening, it's pretty useful. It was cold on the way home this evening - I must remember to put some gloves back in my backpack.

Did you dream last night?

Probably. I have a vague recollection of some vast and improbable story that was in my head before the radio alarm clock kicked in.

Do you remember your dreams?

I forget what I have dreamed about within minutes - and if I do analyse my dreams, they never make any sense at all. I tend to have random characters in bizarre situations - like our back garden flooding up to shoulder level, and mice floating past on model sailing ships, heaving the sails as they go. Perhaps the strangeness means I am creative?

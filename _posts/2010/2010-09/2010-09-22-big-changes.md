Today I did something rather drastic, rather brave, and a little bit silly. I killed the blog I have been writing for the past four years. The content lives on (I migrated everything to here), but the blog - known as "Cheese and Beans" is no more. It was time.

"Cheese and Beans" was created when I had more time, more readers, and still harboured half baked ideas that I was creating a destination of sorts. Over the course of the last year I have retreated ever further from such lofty goals.

In a rather perverse manner, I am only telling a select few that the blog has moved - it will be interesting to discover who notices - who asks. I doubt very much that I will be missed, and that will provide the ultimate validation for what I've done.

I cannot guarantee from this point forwards that I will write here anywhere near as regularly as I once did, but I will try.

This isn't so much a "reinvention", as a "deconstruction" - a simplification of sorts. I'm still me, and these are still my words.

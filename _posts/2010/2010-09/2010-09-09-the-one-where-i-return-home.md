For the last month I have been either holed up in hotels, on client sites, or travelling across the country on a variety of trains. At some point during the hostilities, I took it upon myself to begin recording the various things I saw along the way... enjoy!

First, we have Paddington Station - my morning destination a couple of years ago while commuting back and forth from London. I often saw this view on the way into the station on a morning, and thought it might make a nice photograph.

The court house in Preston... walked past this while making my way to a client site last week, and was struck by the decorative facade.

Wolverhampton Station, late on Tuesday night - taken during my marathon journey home - the Virgin train arrives out of the darkness.

Early this morning I found myself whistling across the English countryside towards another client site, and saw perhaps the first cold mists - is this really the coming of autumn and winter already ?

In a back street in Guildford, I came across the bronze statues of children, and a rabbit - and a plaque a little further on about Lewis Carroll. I'm guessing he lived there for a period of his life...

Finally on the way home this evening, after buying a cappuccino, I spotted this message on the sleeve of the cup, and it made me smile...

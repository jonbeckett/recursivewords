Today has been a remarkably good day. It began at 7am, jumping into a worryingly flexible shower, before donning work clothes and calling for a taxi to take me to the "coal face" (as mentioned previously, I can't talk with too much detail about work...)

Arriving far too early in town, I wandered through the market, which was just setting up for the day, and found a good coffee shop. A guy sat in the far corner with a Macbook just like the one I sold a few months back. I smiled as I stirred chocolate powder into mycappuccino- he was wearing a black polo neck.

The rest of the day went better than any has done for quite some time. I hit a few issues that required homework, but for once a product set came up trumps this evening, and I have all manner of quick wins, tips, and eye opening features to run through tomorrow morning.

Isn't it nice when things "just work" ?

Lunchtime found me back in the same coffee shop, eating a chicken salad, drinking more coffee, munching on chocolate brownies, and watching the world go by. I like coffee shops; in my normal life, I never get to visit them (let along wander into town). I always seem to be going somewhere, getting something, or running an errand.

Anyway. It's getting late. I need to stop writing.

No doubt my enthusiastic tones will be worn away by the journey home tomorrow. Enjoy the happiness while it lasts.

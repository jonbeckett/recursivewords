The weekends seem like some kind of "turnaround", or "pitstop" at the moment. Rather than go into some huge and boring story covering the last few days, I think perhaps a few bullet points might suffice;

Monday - work in office all day, freelance all evening

Tuesday - office in morning, 5 hour journey to client city in afternoon (arriving 9pm)

Wednesday - on-site with client all day, hotel room preparing for next day all evening

Thursday - on-site with client all day, 5 hour journey home in evening (arriving home at 11pm)

Friday - work in office all day, freelance all evening

Saturday - work on freelance work all day, also help wash up, tidy up house, and start washing clothes

Sunday (tomorrow) - leave mid-afternoon for 5 hour trip to client site again.

After nextThursday(another day at a client site), the world should slow down a bit for me. By "slow down", I mean doing the kids breakfasts and lunches, walking to school with them, arriving home in time for dinner, and all the other things that signal "normal" around here.

I am pretty bummed that I'm missing the kids first day at school next week.

In other news, we watched "The Last King of Scotland" last night. Interesting movie. While watching it, I happened to glance at the IMDB page about it, and discovered that the entire story is a fabrication - which kind of killed it for me. Lead character? Never existed. Third wife affair? Didn't happen. Butchering of third wife? Didn't happen. Epileptic son? Didn't exist. WHY does the movie industry insist on re-writing history ?

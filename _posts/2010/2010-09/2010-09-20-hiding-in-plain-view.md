Why do so many people hide behind pseudonyms online? Why are they so scared of being themselves?

Our story, who we are, and what we think are the most interesting things we have to share. While we may choose to conceal what we look like by either not sharing photos, our actions and interactions portray far more about us than any superficial image we might wish to construct.

Why would you choose to hide the best of yourself?

Robin Williams character in Good Will Hunting described the little things we learn about each other once the facade has been torn down. The strange habits, the ticks, the weird things we do. The things only those closest to us know about. Those things are the good stuff.

Be yourself. The most interesting thing about you is you.

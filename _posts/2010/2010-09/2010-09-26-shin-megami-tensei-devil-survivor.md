For the last several weeks I've been planning on getting a role playing game for the DS. Having sold the Playstation 2 and XBox, and not being able to warrant the money for either a PS3 or 360, the DS is my primary gaming device.

Of course it doesn't help that invariably I'm working. I had planned on keeping well away from freelance stuff today (Sunday), but guess what I've been doing for the past half hour, after receiving an email from a client.

So - "Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor" - anybody played it?

Speaking as somebody that refreshes his wardrobe perhaps once every three years (much to the chagrin of my better half), I've been scouting out new websites to buy some clothes from.

Who knew that the brands I typically buy from discount stores actually have new lines!? Who knew that you can actually get stuff in your size ?! Stop laughing.

For years now, my wardrobe has invariably been populated at the lowest cost possible - that usually results in not being able to pick a first choice, or a second - usually because all stock of anything vaguely half decent was bought in nanoseconds by everybody else.Obviously everybody else spends hours waiting for clothes websites to update - perhaps these are the same people that somehow find hours and hours to update Facebook throughout the day.

I digress.

Perhaps it is time I spent some money on some clothes. I notice a couple of stores even have Alexander McQueenlisted. I wondered if this was going to be some kind of bizarre Lady GaGa-esque gallery of mad woman/man costumes, but thankfully not - it's T-Shirts in the same vein as those made famous by Vivienne Westwood (how old does that knowledge make me sound?).

So. Clothes. If I buy nice stuff for a change, what should I be looking at?

After working on freelance stuff into the early hours for the last three nights in a row, I vowed not to this evening. It's rapidly heading towards 1:30am, and here I am again... just downing tools for the night. I can't really complain about it though; I'm doing it out of my own choice, and there is a definite reason for doing it; money!

I'm always amused when people remark "it's only money", when talking about the cost of something; it's a quote only afforded to those with money to spare - with three daughters, a house, and a better half to feed and look after, my mind if pretty much concentrated on making money all the time at the moment - a sentiment shared I suspect with most other parents of small children.

I sometimes wonder if it will all become easier at some point. I looked around friends, and wonder how on earth they can afford to do the things they do. I suppose they are all working like maniacs too.

The madness of the last few days has reminded me of the importance of keeping things in some kind of orderly fashion - be that paperwork, tasks, notes, files, or whatever. Working a day job, doing freelance work, making breakfasts, lunches, washing up, and so on tends to unravel everything after a while. It feels like plate spinning.

So. Like I said - it's racing towards 1:30am. Perhaps I'll put the kettle on - make a cup of tea.

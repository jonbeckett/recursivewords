Maybe it has something to do with not posting anything recently - which has something to do with life and work taking over. Maybe.

Maybe it's time to start reblogging?

I don't actually like to reblog though - I tend to prefer originality over any other content on the internet, and re-hashing other people's stuff seems a bit too viral - a bit too lazy.

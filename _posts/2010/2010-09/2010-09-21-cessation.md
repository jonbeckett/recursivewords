I've been sat here this evening, considering closing the doors to my wordpress blog for the time being. I've been struggling to find anything to write about for months, and consequently the readership has fallen through the floor.

It's a difficult call - writing is often cathartic. I've had the blog for years too - there are perhaps millions of words. Stories about trying for children, IVF, adoption, children, school, work, life, and everything inbetween.

While talking to a friend earlier, I mentioned that WordPress is increasingly becoming life stories only - interests and random thoughts are a better fit with Tumblr and/or Twitter.

I've changed blogging platforms too often though; flitting from one to another as new features got announced. When blogging was popular I had in the region of 300 visitors a day - now it's down to three or four.

I really don't have a clue what to do.

Perhaps sitting on my hands for the moment might be the best idea.

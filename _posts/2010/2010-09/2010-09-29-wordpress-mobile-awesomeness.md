Who knew that WordPress blogs automagically convert themselves for mobile devices?

It's all based on a plugin called WPTouch that's been around for quite some time, but it's still pretty damn clever. Granted, it doesn't work for all devices - but if you're using any of the better smartphones, it will look fantastic. The above image is an HTC Desire, owned by one of my colleagues.

Before you mention it, I know "awesomeness" is not a real word.

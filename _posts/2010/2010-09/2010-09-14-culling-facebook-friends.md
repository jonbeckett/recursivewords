This lunchtime I culled my "friends" on Facebook pretty spectacularly - I realised I was losing touch with people I care about (in the real world, or online) because the vast majority of the news feed was filled with all manner of garbage from old school friends, ex colleagues, people I met at a party several years ago, extended family that I will never meet again, and so forth.

Cutting the bonds - no matter how slight - has been difficult. I always fear hurting any feelings, but when it comes down to it the people I have severed will probably not notice.

It seems to be a month for ending things.

While thinking about the closure of Vox and Bloglines over the weekend (yes, you read it here - Bloglines is closing too!), I started thinking about the various bloggers I have known over the years. Some of them still write, some of them have stopped, some of them "live" in Facebook, others in Twitter, and some of them died.

It seems odd to miss somebody who has died that you never met in the real world.

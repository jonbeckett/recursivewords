It's time to reach out once more across the blogosphere / tumblrsphere / twittersphere, and take note of others.

Being head-down (both day and night) with work for the last week hasn't exactly been the most inclusive experience.

What better way to go on a discovery, reading, reblogging, retweeting, and commenting expedition than to invent a meme for it?

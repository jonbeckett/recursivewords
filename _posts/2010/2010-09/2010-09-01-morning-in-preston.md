8:30am - sitting in Cafe Nero in the middle of Preston - a few minutes walk from my eventual destination (which of course I cannot name for all sorts of professional reasons).

Taxi from hotel to city center was quick, painless, and strangely cheaper than last night. I'm guessing there's some kind of preferential rate going on with a particular company.

I may come out earlier tomorrow morning - watching a city wake up is one of my favourite pastimes - seeing people on their way to work, the newspapers being delivered, the shops opening It reminds me of the time when I ran in the early morning. Perhaps I should make time to do that once more.

There was a guy sitting across from me with a Macbook earlier - identical to the one I used to have. I wonder what Apple are going to release this evening in the US? (they are banging on about a media event). No doubt Leo Laporte and the guys at MacBreak will weigh in on the announcements.

Better finish this coffee and get on with my day

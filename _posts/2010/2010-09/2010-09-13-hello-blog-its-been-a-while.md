Hello blog - it's been a while.

I've not really been writing about anything to do with my life recently, have I. Half of the reason for that has been a conspicuous lack of life to report on - I've been busy working for Sprocket Industries here and there, far and near, for the last few weeks.

Today I am at home, off work with a virus of some kind (I thought it was a bad cold this morning, but am not so sure now - I won't bore you with an amateur diagnosis. Lets just settle on "I feel like shit")

The kids are doing well. They are all back at school now - I missed all of the return due to being here, there and everywhere on Sprocket business - you can imagine how amused I was about that. I heard Little Miss 5 tell the cat that she loved it earlier - that's the first time we have ever heard her use the "L" word. Usually "I like you" is the most you will get from her.

Little Miss 9 has asked for a camera for her 10th birthday. She's worried to death - following our doubts about finding one in time - that she's not going to get one. Little does she know it arrived last week, and is squirrelled away on a bookshelf in the study. We decided to get her a rather more basic camera than we might have; if she can prove to us that it will be looked after, an upgrade might happen. In typical girl fashion, she asked for "a blue one".

My head isn't working today. I imagine that if I revisit this post in days to come, I will discover all manner of spelling, punctuation and grammar horrors. Who cares. I guess this is what professional bloggers might term a "stream of consciousness" - a "life stream".

I wonder if we have any more Batman anti-flu tablets ?

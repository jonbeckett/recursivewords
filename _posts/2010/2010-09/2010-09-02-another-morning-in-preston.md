Sat in Cafe Nero in Preston city center once more, just around the corner from the office I will be working today. Watching the world go by, sipping at a cappuccino, and wondering what the day has in store for me.

A pretty girl sits across from me, with her mobile phone cradled between the pages of a book, texting somebody. Nearer the door two retired guys are sat smiling - relating stories of the recent past to each other. Outside the window a shaven headed guy with a huge ear piercing and bright red shades is sat in the cold morning air.

The girl serving in the cafe yesterday isn't here today. She stuck in my mind because of her tattoos. She was slim, with red hair pulled up on top of her head, and a swallow and a star peaking out above the back of her collar. I wanted to ask if I could take a photo for the blog, but wasn't brave (or stupid) enough.

Perhaps I'm not cut out for this blogging lark.

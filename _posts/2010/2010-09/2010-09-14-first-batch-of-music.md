After much digging around, listening, sorting, and choosing, I have settled on the first few albums to make their way onto the MP3 player that travels with me every day (I just bought a Sandisk Sansa Clip+ for myself).

There is somemethod to the madness - I'm trying not to put too much music on it in one go; I would rather have a restricted set of tracks, and really get to know them. I've done the "entire music collection" thing before, and don't think it's necessarily a good idea.

So - the first few albums;

Biffy Clyro - Only Revolutions

John Mayer - Battle Studies

Katy Perry - Teenage Dream

Owl City - Ocean Eyes

Train - Save Me San Francisco

Of the above albums, Ocean Eyes is obviously the odd-one-out - I had it on my old iPod Nano for a year or so. It's a wonderful, wonderful album.

What are you listening to at the moment?

I've been using WordPress.com for something like 5 years now. During that time I've often tried other blogging solutions out, and always returned. It's getting just a bit bloody silly though...

You can now "like" and "share" posts. Why have both options?

You can change fonts in your chosen template, but it requires an account with another website.

You can add polls to your blog, but it requires an account with another website.

You can now use WordPress to keep track of other blogs (read: RSS aggregator) but it's slow, and nowhere near as good as Google Reader.

My main objection to the world of crap that keeps being stuck onto the core codebase is the lack of thought that's going into its integration. The blogs are starting to look like little link farms... the comment form, and associated like and share buttons stretch on further than most posts. Not the best idea.

A part of me is saying "fck them - I'm moving the blog". Another part of me is saying "who gives a sht - nobody reads this anyway". Yet another part of me is saying "I can't move this damn thing AGAIN".

For the moment I'm sitting on my hands. We all know the best solution out there is probably either self hosting something like WordPress or Habari (which I don't want to do), or paying for SquareSpace (which I also don't want to do). The next best option is probably blogspot...

Or I just stop blogging.

Postscript - I've switched off all the sharing and liking functionality. It doesn't seem to be directly related to any repurcussions (disallowing related posts does, however).

Just watching "The Breakfast Club" (turns out it's 25 years since it's original release), and I started thinking about the age of the cast - given that Judd Nelson was obviously so much older than the rest.

If you've ever wondered how old the cast actually were when the movie was made, wonder no more;

Judd Nelson - 26

Emilio Esteves - 17

Molly Ringwald - 17

Ally Sheedy - 23

Anthony Michael Hall - 17

Only real surprise is probably Ally Sheedy; had no idea she was so much older than the rest - although saying that, shestill looks incredible now.

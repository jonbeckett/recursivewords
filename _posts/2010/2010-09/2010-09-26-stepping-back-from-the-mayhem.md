It's Sunday afternoon, and I have been attempting to avoid anything work related for the day. It occurred to me late last night while tinkering with a freelance project that it's too easy to become focussed on making money, and only engaging in activities aimed towards that end.

Taking a step back is probably a good thing to do. Talking about it, and doing it are two very different things though - and I'm not good at all when it comes to leaving things alone (witness me moving this blog between platforms and addresses every five minutes).

So what has Sunday engaged and entertained with so far? Not much, is the rather successful answer.

While making lunch earlier, upon retrieving a tin of baked beans from the cupboard I discovered all the tinned food was submerged in a huge puddle of brown liquid. Cue half an hour of furiously emptying the cupboard, and trying to figure out (a) what the liquid was, and (b) how the hell to clean it up. It was only while dropping numberous previously dirty tea-towels into the puddle that I began questioning how on earth it had happened. How do you spill something into a cupboard - and why the hell wouldn't you clean it up when it happened ?

Emptying the cupboard ended up causing quite some amusement. I washed all the tins of food, and while doing so checked their dates. Given that tinned food is usually only dated for logistical reasons, I expected to find some museum exhibits. I didn't expect 1998 though. Somehow we had managed to move house ten years ago, and hold on to a number of tins of food. Figure that one out. I figured that some things - prunes, for example, were probably still fine - whereas the five year old tin of custard was probably not so good.

It has got me thinking though - which foods do survive in tins, and which do not ? I'm not stupid enough to think all tinned food lasts for decades, because I've seen soup come out of two year old tins as a congealed mass. Although I was told cooking it would return it to being soup, I didn't want to poison myself trying on that occasion.

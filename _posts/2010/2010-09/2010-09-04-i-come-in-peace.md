Greetings to those who have stumbled upon me following my mass followage of many this evening. I've been quietly existing withing the massed ranks of the tumblrati for years, under various names, and in various guizes.

If you were wondering about the real name on the account, it's basically because I've always appeared as myself on the net - never (well hardly ever) under a pseudonym. I've thought about it lots of times, but it always gets too restrictive before I've even done anything.

So. This is me. Regular guy. Work as a software and web developer - building the sites you complain about both at work, and in the wild. I've been at this stuff long enough to be deservedly cynical about it, and occasionally vent in public. Enjoy it when I do.

I will endeavour to follow your contribution to the tumblrsphere, and if you suspect I am not listening, feel free to hassle the crap out of me via the means splurged all over the contact page.

I'm always online say hello

While spending the last hour or so of my weekend at home with my family this afternoon, I promised the children I would take photographs during my journey north, and post them up for them to see.

The journey began with a walk towards the railway station in town - lugging a backpack full of computers, and a travel bag full of clothes to last a couple of days.

Arriving a few minutes before the train arrived, I joined the other passengers on the platform...

The journey into London took about an hour, via Bourne End and Maidenhead.

Finally we arrive in Paddington Station, where many railway lines leave to head west across the country...

The next leg of the journey took me underneath London - I have no photographs of it, because you are not allowed to use cameras on the Underground (found this out while taking a holiday photo for my cousin) - but I did get this photo at my eventual destination when I came back up - Euston Station...

And following 2 more hours on a wonderful Virgin train (that makes our local trains look like museum pieces), I arrived in Preston...

The hotel I'm staying in is better than expected - basic, but roomy and clean. I have a small desk, satellite television, and a friendly girl working on reception downstairs. The above photo was taken while walking to a nearby store to buy food for dinner.

Most people would have headed to the pub for a meal, but sitting on your own in a pub isn't the most fun in the world. Tomorrow I will be saying hello via Skype - the 3G signal here is strong - which will allow me to find out about a first day back at school from three amazing little girls.

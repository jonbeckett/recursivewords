At 5:45am the younger children woke up, and decided it was a fine time to get up and switch their bedroom light on - this despite the fact that we recently installed a children's alarm clock that shows a sleeping rabbit - you're not supposed to get up until the rabbit wakes up (signalled by birds singing, a cockerel crowing, etc).

After returning to their room seventimes, I removed all the lamps from their room, and threatened to take the lightbulb out of the main light fitting.

At 7:10am I was in the corner shop buying bread and milk to make packed lunches, and breakfast. Arriving home, W presented me with another two-pinter of milk that she found in the children's fridge (yes, we have two fridges in our mad, mad kitchen).

Making a bowl of cereals, I couldn't find a clean bowl so ended up washing up a sink full of stuff.

It's now racing towards 8am, I'm checking emails, and wondering why Twitter has still not rolled the new interface out to me.

Please excuse me while I pack my bag, let the chickens out, and carry on with the morning routine from hell.

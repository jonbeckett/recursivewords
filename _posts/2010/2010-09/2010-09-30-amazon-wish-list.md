Seeing as I can't think of anything to share with the world in general today (earache has something to do with that), perhaps a rather random post might fit the bill. How about a listing of some of the books on my Amazon wish list ?

Unfolding the Napkin, by Dan Roam

Code : Version 2.0, by Lawrence Lessig

Everything is Miscellaneous, by David Weinberger

Here Comes Everybody, by Clay Shirkey

We Think, by Charles Leadbetter

Hackers and Painters, by Paul Graham

Open Sources, by Chris DiBona

Trust Agents, by Chris Brogan

Sidetracks, by Richard Holmes

Leviathan, by Philip Hoare

Yes, yes, I know the geek quotient is massively high among the books listed - but then it's me you're talking about, remember? The same guy that thinks "The Big Bang Theory" is the best television show in years, and struggles to understand why nobody else can see this.

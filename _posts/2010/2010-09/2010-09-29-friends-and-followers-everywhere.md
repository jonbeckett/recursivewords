When I started taking a more pro-active part in the Tumblr community a few months ago, I had no idea what I was going to use it for, or there it might lead. I knew very few people on Tumblr, and had no idea how to engage with others - given that there is no commenting system built in.

It's been a revelation of sorts.

While I have continued to write a personal blog at WordPress, Tumblr has quickly established itself as a great place for the more random recordings of the day; and quite unexpectedly, a source of endless inspiration.

Being able to follow so many creative and thoughtful people, and have their streams of consciousness piped through the dashboard for perusal over coffee has been and continues to be a wonderful diversion.

Something I had not expected at all was the number of followers I have begun to attract. All I'm doing is trying to be original, trying to share interesting stuff, and trying to take the time to look over the content of those I'm following as often as I can.

What am I saying?

Maybe a huge thankyou to Tumblr for providing the platform, and another huge thankyou to the community that I've crossed paths with so far. You are all fantastic.

It's all change again for my personal blog - gone with the minimalist theme, and in with the loud, in your face theme. I would like to say this was all planned, but of course it wasn't. During a fit of "what can I do next" last night, I ended up looking at the free themes over at WooThemes, and came away with this one - it's called "Mainstream" if you are insterested in slapping it on your wordpress install.

I'm not sure that it's any easier or more difficult to read than previous incarnations of "Cheese and Beans", but at least it mixes things up a little. I guess I got bored with the blog being mundane.

Better to be "something" rather than "something of nothing". Feel free to tear into me, and accuse me of being a serial tinkerer (I'll freely admit to it).

At some point over the coming weekend I promise to begin writing "real, proper" posts again - instead of these self interested sidenotes about all manner of geekery.

It's about time I caught my few remaining readers (thankyou for your perseverence, by the way) up on happenings in our menagerie.

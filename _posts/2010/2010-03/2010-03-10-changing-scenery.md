A higher power than myself has dictated that I must move locations in the office once more - and I find myself sat back at the desk I had early last year. I'm well on my way towards having worked in every office of the entire building over the last nine (years.

I have moved early. The rest of the staff are moving around tomorrow (well... those that are in the office will). Beyond one of the new girls, I'm not really sure who else is sharing the office with me - my other half is expressing sympathy for whoever it is.

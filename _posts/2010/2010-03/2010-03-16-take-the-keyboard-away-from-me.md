It would appear that if a computer keyboard is within reach of my insane fingers, I will meddle with the theme of this blog. Given a little reflection, it seems the years of studying, industry experience and hard bitten cynicism were eventually intended to service my WordPress theme fiddling problem.

It's terrible. I have the knowledge to build WordPress (many moons ago I did just that - and I expect none of my readers will know too much about that) - and yet I spend spare moments tinkering. No grand plans and projects for me - if given the opportunity I won't so much as start building the next Apollo 11, as make sure all the wheelnuts on the rocket tractor are shiny.

It's pretty bad, isn't it.

In other news I'm sat here - just gone 10pm GMT in the UK - listening to a band I found called "Owl City". I discovered them quite randomly the other day. Calling "them" a "band" is something of a misnomer. It's one very talented guy and his computer. Sounds good though. It's on now... except of course you can't hear it because (a) you're not here, and (b) you're probably reading this hours or days after I went to bed.

I'm trying hard not to think about theme fiddlage, honest. I know "fiddlage" isn't a real word, before the English police jump on me. It's quite a responsibility you know - maintaining language standards - especially when you are English, and expected to write and speak your native tongue wonderfully.

I'm no Shakespeare.

Heh. This is an achievement - I've written an appallingly constructed post that has no real subject, no direction, and no point. That's got to be worth something hasn't it ?

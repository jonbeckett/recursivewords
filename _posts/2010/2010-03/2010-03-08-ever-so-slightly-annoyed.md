While skimming the various news outlets around the internet before turning in for the night, I happened upon a news story relating the frustration of home schooling parents who cannot find faith related science books that teach the same thing that their children would have been taught in school.

One of the biology textbooks promoted by several of the faith schooling institutions has the following printed in it's preface;

The Christian worldview is the only correct view of reality; anyone who rejects it will not only fail to reach heaven but also fail to see the world as it truly is.

I could write an awful lot about this, but am struggling to cling to my fence top position. Perhaps a few observations might be in order...

If you want your children to have a rounded education where they learn not only about real science, but also about the variety and richness of beliefs and faiths that the many peoples of the world follow, you should have let them go to the same school as everybody else.

Just how threatened are those preaching faith as any kind of answer when they do not encourage free will? Oh, sorry - I forgot - if you encourage free will, you end up with no "followers", and that's what it's all about really, isn't it... your gang. Everybody likes to be in the biggest gang, don't they - so they can claim the high ground, which proves their view is the truth...

Bah humbug.

I know this post will annoy a few people. I make no apology for having written it - I happen to believe in free speech, freedom of thought, and free will. You are free to complain vociferously in the comments in just the same way that I was free to write this.

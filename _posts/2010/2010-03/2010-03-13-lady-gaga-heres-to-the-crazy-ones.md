This week the video for "Telephone" by Lady Gaga was released. There are not enough adjectives. It's inventive, loud, original, and perhaps most importantly, it's different. The famous quote from the annuls of Apple comments on the crazy ones; that they change things. Love her, or hate her, Lady Gaga is changing pop music as we know it - dragging us with her as she turns the machinery.

She polarises audiences in the same way Madonna did. The major difference this time is perhaps that she is a much better singer, and more driven (who thought that was possible?). Once you read past the popular music press headlines, you find a workaholic who keeps her act up through every waking hour, travelling the world every day, endlessly turning the crank handle of a global marketing machine.

When not in front of the cameras or on stage, she is posting to the social networks - sharing her thoughts with her "Little Monsters".

The world has never seen this kind of star. If a person is the sum of her parts, you might say she is the first successful composite of all that have come before; there are shades of Blondie, Britney Spears, Madonna, Christina Aguilera, and many more.

I just wonder how long she can keep it up for.

I don't quite know why I chose the mustard theme. It seemed like a good idea at the time. On reflection, it was pretty crap, wasn't it. Awful in fact. I suspect a few kind words were said by those who quietly had their fingers down their throat.

You will no doubt notice the "Subminimal" theme that I hand wrote is back, while I search for something better.

I'm actually wondering what useful purpose the sidebar serves. I could probably remove the entire thing, and put the content into pages. That would allow the main articles to be bigger.

Of course 99% of this reasoning takes the blog closer to Depo Masthead - a theme I have liked for a long time.

On reflection, my hand made theme isn't too bad at all - it just needs a bit of work on the sidebar to make it presentable... and maybe increase the leading and font size of the main articles...

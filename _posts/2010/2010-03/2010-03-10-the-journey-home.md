1st Mile

Thankyou to the fat little man on the rusty racing bike who must have puffed and wheezed his self down the road in an effort to overtake me as dangerously as possible, and having completed said act of bravado, slowed to an asthmatic crawl. Confronted by traffic (which I stayed in line with), he first wobbled into oncoming traffic, and then onto the footpath - causing families to take avoiding action.

2nd Mile

Thankyou to the driver of the silver Ford that thought it was a good idea to try and pass me while approaching both a narrowing in the road, and an oncoming car. Well done indeed. I particularly liked the bit when you realised (while alongside me) that (a) I wasn't going to slow down, and (b) you were on the wrong side of the road.

3rd Mile

Congratulations to the driver of the people carrier that became stuck behind me while waiting for oncoming traffic to pass. The few seconds you spent waiting - with me - for a gap must have been the reason you then did perhaps 50 miles an hour in as erratic a manner as possible for the next 100 yards.

This stuff happens almost every night. For some reason this evening I thought it worthy of recording in words - especially given a conversation earlier in the afternoon about the struggle to find anything worth writing about.

The "big" computer at home - the desktop one with printers and various other doo dads attached - is busy checking for monsters in it's own closet. It's been acting up for a little while, and I'm giving Microsoft the benefit of the doubt at least until the monster hunt finishes.

I have been running Windows 7 without any form of virus protection since I installed it several months ago. I never give it much thought - I don't download email, and I don't download hacked software from the interwebs.

If it turns out that Windows is free of nasties, I will of course focus my sights on Redmond, and begin venting scorn, spite, bile and any other unwanted fluids in it's general direction. Exorcist style. This lone (aggravated) voice will not be noticed among the millions, but I'll feel a whole lot better about it.

Every time I find something else wrong with Windows, I edge a little closer to Ubuntu. Before kids that sentence would have read "OSX", but the cult of Apple is one we can no longer afford - given the regular fiscal requirements around here for shiny little shoes, jam, hair clips by the thousand, and other such little girl army paraphernalia.

I still use the Macbook. I still use the iPod. I don't pick the iPhone up any more (even though it now exists on a pay-as-you-go SIM), mainly because it's broken. I only know one person who's had an iPhone that didn't stop working properly in some way or another... I guess that's the price of the bleeding edge.

p.s. the Blackberry still rocks - for no other reason than it just works.

While reading other people's blogs I always find myself making mental notes to take more photos - and to share more of them. This is an attempt to do just that - with a little text to accompany. Enjoy!

My birthday happened a little earlier in the month, and following a cake disaster of sorts, pudding got turned into a trifle instead. It didn't last long, so you could say it was a success.

Last weekend we visited my aunt in Oxfordshire and the girls got to see some horses up-close. We're praying that our youngest loses interest in learning to ride by the time she is old enough to do so.

A candid moment on Saturday afternoon, lined up in front of the TV with snacks and no sock on, apparently.

Our eldest, who I am terrifically proud of (hey, I'm allowed!). You would never guess the nervous, shy little girl that came to us two years ago would have blossomed into the headstrong, sarcastic, funny, sulky, bouncy normal girl that we have on our hands.

I spent much of last night installing the latest version of Ubuntu Linux on the netbook. I shouldn't have really - it's not been released yet, and is about as reliable as a baby's bottom.

There are far more on Flickr if you're nosy.

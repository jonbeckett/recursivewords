For many of my friends on the other side of the ball of mud we inhabit, Thursday is "Thanksgiving". Due to my geographical displacement, which leads to an entirely different history, culture, and customs, I will not be eating Turkey (well, I might, but it will be ready sliced in sandwiches).

It might surprise some of my American friends to learn that hardly any of the rest of the world celebrate "Thanksgiving", and even the mighty Wikipedia has little to say on the subject. The photo they posted made me smile though;

I don't mind about losing out on the day off though - I'm getting a day off work next April to celebrate Prince William and Catherine Middleton getting married 

In all seriousness, I have no idea what the true surname of our future monarch really is - I suspect I am right (and am bound sure to be corrected), but it's hard to find anything definitive.

You can imagine the speeches in Church;

Do you, William Arthur Philip Lewis Sax Coburg Golgotha Windsor, take her, Catherine Middleton, to be your lawfully wedded wife?

Do you, Catherine Middleton, agree to give up all of your privacy, friends, acquaintances, family, and safety? Do you agree to be photographed from 500 yards by a camoflaged photographer while in your swimsuit, and then the photographs sold worldwide?

I'm not so sure I don't feel sorry for Kate - but then I guess she knows exactly what she's in for, and the "split" a couple of years ago was more than likely a planned chance to go to the pub with her friends and be "normal" before throwing life as she has known it on top of a very big bonfire.

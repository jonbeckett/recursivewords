Is this a final "look and feel" for the blog? Probably not, but it's a step in the right direction. Something a little more personal; a little less abstract. It will do.

I seem to have been on something of an artistic streak in recent days; either photographing, tweaking, or monkeying with a couple of friends about.me pages. Feel free to go take a look;

http://about.me/jonbeckett (yours truly)

http://about.me/pamlewis (long time interweb buddy)

http://about.me/amhawkins (colleague, and long time friend)

Andrew (amhawkins) has also built himself a wordpress blog, using a slice of the same image seen at about.me - in a roundabout way it's the main influence for the new banner here, because I was so impressed with it.

In other news, I've continued dabbling with Google Buzz today, while not being pulled in ten directions at once and getting nowhere fast. It was a relief to come home and just do one thing at a time.

Finally, the following arrived through the post today;

It's a "Rothco HW Classic Messenger Bag" - apparently very similar to the one Jack Bauer carries around in the "24" - which probably means something to somebody, but unfortunately not me; I've not seen a single episode of it. Ever.

The bag will be helping me carry the netbook, a paper notebook, and various other miscellaneous crap around. Watch out for the inevitable "101 things wrong with my new messenger bag" post some time soon.

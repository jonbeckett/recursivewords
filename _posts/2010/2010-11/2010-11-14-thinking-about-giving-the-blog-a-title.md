This blog doesn't really have a title, does it. "jonbeckett @ wordpress" kind of states the obvious. Although the URL is deliberately in-line with my twitter, facebook, and tumblr accounts, I'm guessing that the title doesn't have to match, does it ?

This of course opens a can of worms, because I will have to think up a title. A few that immediately come to mind;

Life and Times (it used to be called this, many moons ago)

The Enormous Waste of Webspace (it used to be called this too!)

Turtles, All The Way Down (a reference to a funny evolution lecture story)

Foaming Invective (one of my posts was once described thus by a colleague)

I really have no idea... suggestions ?

Postscript - trying out "no title" for a while - replicating the URL into the top of the page... the blog is about my life and thoughts, so why not just leave the URL up there?

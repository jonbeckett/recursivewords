It's just gone 1am at the time of writing, and I should be asleep - I guess this post proves I am not.Not quite sure why I am becoming such a night owl of late. An unquiet mind perhaps.For the first time in a couple of weeks I blew the evening off, doing not much at all. Turns out this "not doing much" is a fun activity - one that should be promoted.

Of course "not doing much" is a misnomer. My version of "not doing much" this evening amounted to the following;

Catching up with iJustine's ridiculous exploits

Trying out the 2011 incarnation of Windows Live Writer

Installing LibreOffice on the netbook

Fiddled a tiny bit with a freelance project

Read about the hilarious marketing failure surrounding Windows Phone 7 (no - seriously - you need to go read about the promoted hashtag on twitter - or better still, just go read twitter itself...)

Almost got a chess set out

Almost sat down with a book

Ate a frozen pizza

Drank the last alcohol left in the fridge

I guess the sudden lack of pizza and/or alcohol in the house is cause for mad panic. Better remember to buy something on the way home from work tomorrow.

Must also remember it's my turn to buy biscuits for the office!

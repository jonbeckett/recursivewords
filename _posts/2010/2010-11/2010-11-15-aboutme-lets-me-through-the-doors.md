A little while ago I signed up for a new internet "landing page" service thing, and then promptly forgot all about it. Just before collapsing into bed last night, while switching the Blackberry into silent mode, a new email arrived.

I'm in! I now have the landing page http://about.me/jonbeckett !

The above was created in a couple of minutes. The basic idea is whenever anything asks for a hompage URL, you point them at your about.me page, which then links through to everywhere you might be found online (or at least the places you want to be found).

Interestingly, the site also keeps statistics on how many people have visited your homepage, and also delves into your twitter and facebook interactions; figuring out who follows you most closely, and who you happen to be following most closely at the moment. It reminds me of the Klout website in some ways.

Anyway - go visit about.me and reserve your username before they all get taken!

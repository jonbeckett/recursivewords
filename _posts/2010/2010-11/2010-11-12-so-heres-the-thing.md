This month I'm taking part in "National Blog Posting Month" - also known as NaBloPoMo. There's a website hosted at Ning, and a lot of bloggers taking part... only you would never know - even if you visited the damn website.

The first time NaBloPoMo ran, it was fun. There was a directory of people taking part, and a real sense of community formed around the central hub website. None of that is happening this time, and it's a little bit sad.

In many ways, taking part this year is being driven by the past, and the friends I still have that I made in Novembers past - perhaps not the best motivation. That being said, over recent weeksI've discovered a number of fantastic writers online, and am having a blast sharing their stories, thoughts and opinions when I get the chance.

Time seems to be the enemy. Oh to lead a life of leisure frequenting coffee shops during the daytime, armed with the netbook, a roving eye, a quick wit, and an acerbic tongue...

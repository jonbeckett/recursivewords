When I first saw the photo below, I thought "YES!"...

I have no idea how the above photo has entered the public domain, but it has, and provides something of a relief for all of us that witness the polished sermons from Mount Apple every year or so.

He is human. His study is just as untidy as everybody elses. He can't throw old crap away either. There is hope for us yet!

After a quick check, it would appear the image comes from the April 2010 issue of Time Magazine... I wonder how you buy back copies?

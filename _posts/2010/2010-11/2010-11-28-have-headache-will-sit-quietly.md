It's Sunday afternoon, and the rest of the family have headed off to visit their grandparents. Owing to me being pretty fantastically ill, but not really going on about it, I'm staying home - in the warm - and trying not to do too much with myself. That being said, I still spent the first couple of hours after getting up this morning tidying the house up, washing up, and the rest of the chores that tend to fall in my direction.

Sitting quietly in the warm probably means television, movies, or books for most people. Not me - or rather, not me at the moment. I have been picking away at odds and ends on the internet most of the day so far; the fruits of this noodling has so far been the following;

The Google Buzz Wall of Awesome

A very silly utility, that you saw the results of yesterday, if you're a regular reader of my blog.

The Google Buzz Deep Dig

Another silly utility that does have a useful function - it digs through all your Google Buzz followers (or those you follow), and figures out who hasn't posted in ages... meaning you can bring themachetedown on your association with them, and live a calm, peaceful, cruft free life... yeah, right.

This is the problem with being a software developer - pretty much anything can be regarded as a blank canvas, as an opportunity - and before you know it, half the day is gone, and all you have to show for your toil is a semi-useful party trick webpage that a minority of people will ever find, let alone find useful.

I guess in some ways the above webpages are no different than my Grandad tinkering in his shed years ago... I like that idea.

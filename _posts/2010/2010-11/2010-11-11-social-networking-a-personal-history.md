I don't often think of myself as using social networking much. Sure, I have accounts almost everywhere, but that's more to do with reserving my name should I want to use whatever the service is in the future (Oklahoma land rush mentality).

Thinking back through this morning, perhaps I should revise things somewhat;

Checked in on Windows Live, and Yahoo Pulse to confirm friend requests

Logged in to Facebook to share a photo of our youngest with friends and family

Touched base with far flung SysAdmin friend, who was deriding my recent dalliances with Windows Live

Replied to a private message on Twitter

Had a conversation with my cousin in Oxfordshire via Facebook, SMS, and email

Caught up with W via Google Talk

I do use a lot of this stuff, don't I...

It's got me thinking; about the services I have used over the years - the communities I've been an active part of - before my addled brain forgets everything about those early days, I thought it might be fun to see just how much I can remember.

Bulletin Boards

Back in the days of 56K modems, my first interactions "online" were with members of bulletin board systems, talking about all manner of garbage. I remember the character based interfaces seeming tremendously clever, when in reality they were utterly hopeless.

Compuserve

The first real community I joined in the early 90s. In many ways Facebook is only now beginning to foster the same community spirit that Compuserve had then.

CiX (Compulink Information Exchange)

A UK based social network over dial-up. The client software - called "Ameol" - was the best "off line reader" application I have ever seen, before or since. The community was fantastic too.

LiveJournal

I guess LiveJournal might count as my first "blog" - and the first website I regularly visited in the early days of the Web. It's easy to forget now that until 1994 the web was not the primary means of consuming information from the internet. I still have friends now from those early days on LiveJournal.

Yahoo 360

In it's day, Yahoo 360 was better than Facebook. It was open, full of interesting people, and a genuinely exciting place to share and communicate online. As far as I recall it never officially left "beta" status.

MySpace

Oh MySpace - how did it all go so wrong? Once upon a time you counted something like a third of all people on the internet as your members, and forged many amazing friendships that I still have today all over the world.

Vox

Once upon a time Vox was going to be the successor to LiveJournal, and became the place to write, to share, and to communicate online among the higherechelonsof the web populance. It looked great, worked great, but was a walled garden.It shut down earlier this year - ironically LiveJournal still lives.

Flickr

Still going strong, many people forget that Flickr does far more than just photo sharing - it has many of the features of the big social networks, and often better security features. I never really got into the whole photography-snob side of it, but have always used it as a repository of family photos.

Orkut

I can still remember the day a web designer friend in San Francisco showed me Orkut (way before Facebook was opened up to the non-academic world). I still don't really know why it didn't take off - it has essentially the same functions as the modern social networks. Perhaps the name? Who knows...Of course in some parts of the world, Orkut is the most popular social network.

Digg

Social bookmarking site par-excellence, and recent victim of it's own past failings. Holes in the Digg design allowed it to be gamed by those who might make money from greater exposure of their material within the site. When the holes were plugged recently, the gamer faithful turned rogue. It's a shame - Digg was always the best place (pre twitter) to find out about breaking news.

Facebook

I was a member of Facebook from their earliest days - when they opened to the outside world as a "Beta" service. I still remember the banner with Zuckerberg's silhouetted face in it. They have many detractors, but there's no denying the brilliance of their creation...

Twitter

Perhaps because of my job, the news I read, and the podcasts I listen to, I was a member of Twitter from the very start too. I remember the early outages, and the emergence of competing services such as Jaiku and Identi.ca. I still find it amazing that it continues to grow in the manner it does.

LinkedIn

More a directory of business associates than a social network - I have an account at LinkedIn, but rarely use it beyond finding the email address for old colleagues. The more career focussed of my friends use it far more, and sing it's praises.

Windows Live

I think it appeared for the first time back in 2008, and first impressions looked like Microsoft were copying Facebook to the last detail. The 2011 repaint looks much more like a portal than a service, and that's good news. It's just a shame that it doesn't quite do everything you might like it to.

Yahoo Pulse

In the same way that many things appear to have happened at Yahoo over the last few years, Yahoo Pulse is a poorimitationof both Facebook, and Windows Live. It's clunky, difficult to navigate around, and seems badly thought out, which is a huge shame - Yahoo 360 was so good!

Holy crap that's a lot of social networks - but then I guess their existence and popularity spans from the late 1980s right through to the present day - over 20 years !

Where have you lived online? Where do you miss the most ?

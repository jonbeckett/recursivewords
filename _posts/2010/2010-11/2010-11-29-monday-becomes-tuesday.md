This is probably the closest I have come to failure at this whole "post every day during November" malarky. It's approaching 11pm, and I've finally got the chance to sit here and write a few words. They're not going to be tremendously insightful, or memorable, but they are words, and they mean I don't fail the challenge.

So what have I been so busy being busy at?

7:00am to 8:40am

Child wrangler, and not-woken-up-yet Dad

8:40am to 9:00am

Grumpy, yawning cyclist, narrowly avoiding certain death

9:00am to 5:30pm

Stressed software developer, making huge progress and ageing in the process

5:30pm to 5:50pm

Grumpy, tired cyclist, trudging through the sub-zero temperatures

5:50pm to 8:00pm

Tired eater of dinner, and story teller to the children

8:00pm to 11:00pm

Incredibly tired freelance web developer, fighting the urge to publicly complain about how badly built Drupal is.

So there you go. My day has mostly consisted of staring at computers - and now I'm doing it again. I will do it again tomorrow, and the next day, and the next day... you get the idea. This cannot be good, can it ?

Change of subject.

Did you know WordPress used to sell mugs?

It would appear you could only buy them in the US, and you can't buy them any more anyway - at least not "official" ones. I'm wondering about writing to Sir Matt of Mullenweg to see if he would mind me making a couple of my own with the downloadable logo.

There's a quote about balance in Nature, isn't there. I was reminded of it this morning while peering out of the landing window across the green where we live. Where yesterday the world outside had been filled with sunshine, green grass, blue skies, and birds singing, this morning somebody had turned the colour knob right down, and poured several billion gallons of water over everything.

A quick look at the weather forecast confirmed my fears. Severe weather warnings across the entire country - predictions of the great flood, and widespread carnage.

After arriving at work a few moments ago, I would say the predictions were a little bit enthusiastic. Yes, it is wet, but I haven't seen any large wooden boats filled with animals.

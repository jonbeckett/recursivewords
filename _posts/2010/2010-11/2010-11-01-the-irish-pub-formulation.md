My other half takes great delight in making parallels between Sheldon Cooper, one of the principal characters in the TV show "The Big Bang Theory", and me. While this might not sound too bad, if you're familiar with the show, you'll know that being like Sheldon is nothing to be proud of at all...quite the reverse actually...

How best to explain? How about a few choice quotes from Dr Sheldon Cooper over the past few seasons of the show;

Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors.

Excuse me, but the sun is essential for all life on earth. Frosty is merely a bit of frozen, supernatural ephemera in a stolen hat.

Lois Lane is falling, accelerating at an initial rate of 32ft per second, per second. Superman swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Ms. Lane, who is now traveling at approximately 120 miles per hour, hits them, and is immediately sliced into three equal pieces.

So why am I thinking about Sheldon today? Because we watched the latest episode of the show late last night (which finally explains the title of the post!), and my better half was nearly in tears when Sheldon "discovered" text adventure games on the computer - a subject I wrote about on this very blog last week.

Even before I turned to look at her, she was inconsolable.

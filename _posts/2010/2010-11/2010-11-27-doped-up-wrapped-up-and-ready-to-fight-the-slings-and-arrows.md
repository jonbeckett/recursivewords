It's Saturday morning, I'm doped up on "Max Strength" cold and flu remedy, wrapped up like an eskimo, and facing the prospect of taking the children to the local primary school "Christmas Bazaar" after lunch, where Mrs B is running the Grotto, and doing face painting.

Light snow fell overnight, greeted with excited shouts of "it's snowing!" from atop the sewing machine box on the landing this morning (it affords small people a view from the landing window across the green we live next to).

When I let the chickens out this morning, they didn't seem altogether pleased about their water being frozen solid; they now have a cat bowl as well as their normal drinker. I must remember to give them some fresh bedding... they're going to need it as the temperatures plummet over the coming days.

I can't believe Christmas is so close now.

Every time I login to the Amazon online storewhere I freely admit to buying most thingspurely because I trust their logistics and distribution more than anybody elseI am confronted by the advertisement for the Kindle. I'm torn. There is an obvious argument behind me not buying a Kindlethe DRM. Amazon have created the same idiotically walled garden for electronic books that Apple has for music. It's the main reason I've dropped iTunes at home, and given my iPod to my other half. There's another reason I'm resisting an ebook reader thoughI just don't read many books any more and that makes me kind of sad. Most of my free time in the last few years has been spent either involved with the children, working on freelance projects, or blogging. If anything, bloggingboth writing, reading, and contributing a little to the social networksis encroaching more and more on other activities. The last book I remember sitting down and reading cover to cover was a couple of years ago nowwhile still commuting into and out of London. Ever since, the reading has ground to a halt. I bought a huge stack of (paper) books from Amazon to kick-start me into reading at about the same timebooks I had been wanting to read for yearsand I've not read any of them yet. If I spin around in my chair, they are neatly stacked behind me on a book shelf. How much do you read? Do you read as much, or more than you used to?

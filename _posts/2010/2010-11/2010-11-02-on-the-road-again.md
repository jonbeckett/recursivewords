Tiredness. That's the overriding feeling. It's been a while since I've done a 6am start, and a day pretending to know what I'm on about in front of professional clients. Two more similarly brain crushing days to go (in truth, it's been a good day - the hours flew by).

It's heading towards 9:30pm now. I'm sat in the study, and I've been procrastinating for the last half hour - trying to convince myself that finding a good track to listen to will help me also find something worth writing about. Turns out I was half right - anything with words does nothing but help me sit back in the chair and listen.

Jean Michel Jarre it is then. Mr Wallpaper Music himself.

There must have been something worth relating from the day... come on brain - help me out here...

Ah yes... the girl in the lycra leggins.

While waiting for the train at Maidenhead station this morning, a tall modelly type in her twenties with impossibly long legs and salon perfect hair strode down the platform past me. I will completely admit I noticed her because of her legs - I'm human after all (shock horror).

She was followed along the platform by a woman in her forties with a trench coat on, and a handbag that looked suspiciously like it might be filled with bricks. As is normal in these situations, I lost interest in Miss Long Legs, and watched the woman behind her, who seemed to be looking her up and down in the way Professor Snape might while spitting incantations at her.

I smiled.

As luck would have it, among the melee getting off the train at Reading, the girl ended up a few people ahead of me climbing the stairs towards the overhead walkway into the terminal building. This time a woman I'm guessing was in her late thirties climbed the stairs behind her - and looked her up and down with perhaps the most disgustedly jealous expression on her face I think I have ever seen.

Too funny.

The disgusting coffee I purchased in the station wiped the smile clean off my face. When I discovered that one coffee shop was much cheaper than the other, I became unbearably smug. I obviously didn't notice that the expensive coffee shop was really busy, and the other one not so much. I found out whythe moment I tasted it.

Served me right really.

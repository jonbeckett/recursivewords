Partly as a result of my other half being "Brown Owl", and party so our kids didn't miss out, I took part in the annual Brownies father's day event this evening.

It was serious stuff - a three legged race, a wheelbarrow race, a piggy back race, a dressing up race, and perhaps the most fun - "welly wanging" (otherwise known as welly throwing).

They say a photo speaks more than a thousand words...

I think I came third in the piggy back race (which was a miracle, seeing as I had to react to everybody else moving - I couldn't hear the starter because all the girls waiting for the next heat were making such a noise screaming, laughing, and shouting).

Technically I won the welly throwing - mine landed far further down range than anybody elses, but the girls measuring it for some unknown reason measured where they finished skidding to... I didn't say anything because we'd already won a sticker for the piggy back race.

I'm not going to talk about the dressing up race... for some reason other Dads got old granny dresses to wear - I suspect W nobbled my pile of clothes to make sure I had some lycra girls dress to slide into.

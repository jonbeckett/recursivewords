Each year the infant school hosts a "camping on the school field" father's day event. I did it last year single handed with the kids - this time W came along too.

What a difference a year makes - we hardly saw the children last night, and got a chance to catch up with a few of the other parents that we know. I don't know many of them because I rarely pick the children up from school, but it was still interesting to see so many come together as an outsider - to see the various cliques going on around the field.

I have a few aches and pains this morning - mostly as a result of sleeping on the ground. We only have two thermarests, and we gave those to the children. Somehow during the night W managed to hijack the blankets our sleeping bags were on top of too.

All the efforts were repaid this morning when I arrived home, unpacked the car, threw all the camping stuff back in the loft, and came downstairs to receive the contents of the photo above - a case of custom labelled "Dad" beer.

In other news, I was going to get my Dad an iTunes voucher for fathers day (he got a Nano a little while ago), but the legion of idiots trying to pre-order the new iPhone are making it impossible to order anything from Apple at the moment...

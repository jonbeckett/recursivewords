Do you ever get the feeling that the world has carried on quite well without you, thankyou very much, and that you're involvement in it isn't really needed at all ?

I went back to work today after a week away. Quite apart from the waves of tiredness effected by a 5am wake up (from our chickens - who had escaped their run), I just can't get interested in anything.

I'm sure the funk will pass, and I'll wakeup tomorrow happier, more awake, more talkative, and perhaps a little more approachable than I am today.

Here's hoping.

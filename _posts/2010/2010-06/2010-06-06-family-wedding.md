We just got back from spending the afternoon and evening at Knebworth manor attending a family wedding. It was a privilage, and a pleasure to be invited to such a great wedding, and to share some time with a wonderful family. It was perhaps the first family wedding I have attended where I have been on the outside looking in - a distant relation, through marriage - rather than a blood relative of one of the happy couple.

A few photos are perhaps the order of the day;

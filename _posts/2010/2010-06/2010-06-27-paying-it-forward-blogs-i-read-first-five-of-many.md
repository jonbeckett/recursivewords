In the spirit of "paying it forward", I have listed below five of the blogs I regularly read. They are not listed in any particular order, and if you're suddenly thinking "where's my blog?" (in a suitably disgruntled tone), think not - I will repeat this post over the coming weeks with another five, and another five, and so-on until I have covered everybody.

Nobody is going to miss out!

So... while I might not manage to comment reliably on every post everybody writes (that's a bit too close to stalking in my mind), here are some fantastic blogs;

Cheaty Monkey

Cheaty Monkey is fantastic. It's written by a girl called Haley in Canada, and is remarkably candid, witty, anarchic at times, but always brutally honest. Check it out at cheatymonkey.com.

Blogapotamus Rex

I can't remember how long I have been reading Blogapotamus for. It's one of the rare blogs where I've met the author (and her family). It's going to be mightily interesting over the coming months as they up-sticks are move to the US from small town England. By turns it's funny, honest, head-noddingly topical, and fantastically written. Head on over to blogapotamus.com to check it outseemed to stick - following each other's ramblings now for better or worse. It's another wonderfully written blog (are you seeing a theme here?), and provides thoughtful insight into the everyday stuff that we all write about. Head over to aepage.net/weblog to check it out.

Advice from a Single Girl

Written by "Victoria", I've been reading "Advice from a Single Girl" for a very long time now. I can't actually remember how long it's been... I think perhaps (apart from the great writing) the thing that keeps me coming back is the honesty, and the candid moments shared with the readers about dates that went wrong, memories of past relationships, and the same worries, fears, and hopes that I had before a nuclear family landed on top of me. Head over to advicefromasinglegirl.blogspot.com and check it out!

A Right Grapesnest

Here comes another one that ticks all the boxes - fantastic writing, funny, and above all really great content. I can draw a lot of parallels from the author's personality and my own - which is perhaps why I love it so much. By turns it's funny, candid, and thought provoking - talking about everything from raising children, to blogging, to day-to-day work. Head on over to arightgapesnest.blogspot.com and check it out.

So there you go. The first 5 blogs from the blogroll, cherry picked for your interest and amusement by my good self - mainly because I couldn't think of anything to write about this evening.

Enjoy!

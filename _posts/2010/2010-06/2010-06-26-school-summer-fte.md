We just got back from the junior school summer fte - part of our annual jam packed itinerary of school fund raisers, parents evenings, sports days, PTA events, and other stuff that conspires to make sure we never have an empty weekend.

For the first time in memory, I didn't take part in the Dads versus Mums tug-of-war - our youngest has begun reacting to pollen, and broke out in spots all over her body while on the school field - no amount of anti-histamine seemed to work.

Anyway... no time to write (how typical is that!) - taking eldest to friend's house.

I've been up since about 8, have an ever so slight hangover, and am busy watching Sunday vanish in front of my own eyes - in much the same way as the traffic to this blog. The odd thing is the ambivalence I feel towards the falling numbers.

Yesterday morning I took a good look at the Posterous blogging platform again - they have a campaign going on at the moment to switch people from competing services such as WordPress, Xanga, Blogger, Vox, or Tumblr.

I nearly switched.

In other news, we caught up with Big Bang Theory last night - here's an excerpt of the episode "The Pants Alternative" - enjoy.

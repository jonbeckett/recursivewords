Sunday morning. Kids are fed and watered, chickens are fed and watered, I'm dressed, I've brushed my teeth, the kids are playing our museum piece electric piano, and the youngest is crying. Typical Sunday morning really.

Macbreak weekly is playing on the iPod in the kitchen - not really sure why I listen to it any more - I don't own a Mac, or an iPhone any more (W still has her Macbook though). Even though I'm pretty much platform agnostic - I don't really care what I use - it's interesting to keep at least one finger in the Apple pie to see what's coming. Apple tend to do things right first time far more often than anybody else (witness the iPad).

Ok. Here's a heads up, and something you probably need to take notice of if you're interested in technology - the daily tech show "Tech News Today" has kicked off. It's a daily morning show hosted by Tom Merrit, Sarah Lane, and Becky Worley, in a very similar format to Buzz Out Loud.

It's going straight into my iTunes podcast subscriptions, but you can also listen directly on your machine via the website. If you go to TWiT Live at the right time in the day, you get to see the show being recorded live as it goes out. I'm guessing the radio networks will try to buy the show soon too.

Why am I making such a big deal about "Tech News Today"? Probably because this is the future of broadcasting. Leo Laporte was way ahead of the curve when he started the whole TWiT network, and this is just another step along the way. I'm betting the news coming out of the Apple conference on Monday will re-enforce this view - there are rumours that Apple TV is going to be revved to stream live content off the net (it's not as mad as it sounds - iTunes always had live radio - so live TV isn't the leap you might think).

Anyway - I'm going to go find some smart clothes and hang them up - we're off to a family wedding later - expect a few photos late this evening!

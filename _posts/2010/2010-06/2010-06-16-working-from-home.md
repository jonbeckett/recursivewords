There must be something about being six years old. Illness doesn't just cause a temperature - it causes hallucinations, nightmares, and a pretty good line in gibberish.

Little Miss 6 went downhill the night before last. She was supposed to be on a school trip today visiting Warwick Castle, but that went out of the window at 9 last night when she screamed, and I raced up the stairs to find a terrified little girl in the corner of her bed telling me there "were monsters".She then did pretty much the same every half an hour or so until about 2am.

Weirdness must have been a theme last night - I had a truly bizarre dream last night about missing a flight at an airport while travelling home with a Japanese gentleman. Best not to analyse that one too much.

Anyway... work to do...

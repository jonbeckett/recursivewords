I'm off work - for the first time in months. What I thought was the after-effects of too much red wine yesterday morning didn't get any better throughout the day.

When I got off my bike yesterday evening (I ride a mountain bike the six-or-so miles to and from work), I thought I was just tired - so carried on with the usual routine; washing up, tidying up, dinner, bedtime stories... it wasn't just tiredness - I very nearly passed out.

Not good.

I think somehow today is going to be a quiet day. Read a book, drink tea with honey, keep out of the way... have a rest.

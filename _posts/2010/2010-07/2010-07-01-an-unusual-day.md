I had the day off work on Tuesday, to attend our eldest daughter's school sports day. For the first time in months - if not years - I had the chance to wander into town after dropping the kids off in the morning, and spend time with W on our own.

We need to do it more often.

Sitting in a quiet cafe, sipping a nice drink, talking about anything and everything, and munching on a pastry without somebody saying "I'm hungry", or "I need a wee", or "Can I have...", was fantastic.

We both realised that our lives are consumed with the children - and that it's not good for either of us. We need to have some kind of regular "escape" - some "me" time for each of us. I'm imagining mine might be an hour on a Saturday or Sunday morning - to go sit in a cafe with my netbook, sip a drink, and watch the world go by.

Perhaps I need a hobby, or some kind of interest outside of work and family? The immediate suggestion that I know several people might throw at me is "running" - there is a running club in town, and I used to quite enjoy early morning runs, but I'm really after something easy - something relaxing, or interesting.

Perhaps I should look at nightclasses at the local schools - they will be starting up in August and September I suppose...

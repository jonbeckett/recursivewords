I'm sat here at work, watching a new product install, and reboot the machine repeatedly (thankfully I have another computer to useotherwise I would go quite, quite mad).

What is there to say? It's Friday afternoon, the weekend is nearly here, and before I know it next week will have arrived. I've noticed since having children that the weekends tend to rumble past like a juggernautusually dragging me along the road with them by my collar. Often Monday is a relief of sortsreturning to the relative peace and quiet of work once more. Weekends are brilliant fun too thoughthey let me spend time with the children, play games, go places, and share a little of their rapidly changing lives. Of course I also get sucked into delivering them to various destinations for birthday parties (we seem to be in the middle of birthday season at the moment?!), making each child different lunches because they are claiming they don't like something today that they ate a plate full of yesterday, and so on Still waiting for product install snore.

In other news, it turns out the idiot mobile phone companies in the US are filling Android phones with crapware that cannot be removed. The first phone to be seriously afflicted with it is the Droid X. It's such a shame. I thought we left the world of crapware behind years ago. The fact that you can't even remove the rubbish is a reallygood reason not to buy those handsets in the first place. Idiots.

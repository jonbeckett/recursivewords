"What would you think about 3 kittens?"Following an exchange of questions and answers via mobile phone, and a rather mystified call, it transpired that we are finally thinking about a replacement for the famous (in our house at least) "Simpson"our many adventured cat that ran out of lives last year. W had called the Cat Protection League (think "rescue center"), and enquired if they had a cat suitable for re-homing. The immediate question from them was "how do you feel about 3 kittens?". There is suddenly a huge sense of deja vucasting our mind back about three years, following our journey through the many layered labyrinth of the care system our social worked looked into the distance one morning and told us "there are these three girls" Three kittens. Ginger. All boys.

Following a pretty lengthy phone call while waiting for another train, I pretty much told my other half to say yes. She was too scared to make the decisiontherefore it all becomes my fault, and I'm fine with that. She's sneaking out this afternoon to see them.

The children have no idea.

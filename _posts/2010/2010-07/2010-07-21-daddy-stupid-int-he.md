After hearing little people stomping across the upstairs landing the other evening (long after they should have been asleep), I quietly walked upstairs and opened our younger children's bedroom door. Little Miss 6 was barking instructions at Little Miss 5, who appeared to be doing some kind of gymnastic routine, high above her bed. Little Miss 5 caught sight of me mid-leap, and somehow fell straight back under the duvet, curled up, and shut her eyes very tightly indeed. "What's going on?""Well, she keeps waking me up", said Little Miss 6 (who had been barking instructions, remember)As soon as we hear a sentence begin with "Well", we know the rest of it will be made up. "I've been stood outside the door. I heard you. You were both awake. It's bedtime. You should be asleep by now!""But""No buts - if I have to come back upstairs again, I'm going to start confiscating toys" I retreated to the landing, and stood quietly for a few moments. Suddenly Little Miss 5 broke the silence with wonderfully soft, consoling tones;"Daddy stupid int he"

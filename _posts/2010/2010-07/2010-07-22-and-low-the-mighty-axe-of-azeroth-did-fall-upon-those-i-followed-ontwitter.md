Somewhere, in the deep, dark corners of the internet, sombody is probably quite upset that I unfollowed them this morning. I brought to bear the great axe of "not following any more" (which doesn't sound very scary actually), and reduced those I stalk on Twitter from over a thousand to less than fifty. Quite an achievement. Here's the lucky remnants; If you're indignantly threatening to disinherit me due to your non-appearance in the list, let me know (twitter.com/jonbeckett) and I will instantly cave in and re-follow you. My method for clearing the list down wasn't exactly careful - it went something like this; Remove all those who are not following me back Remove all companies Remove all that I don't "know" It seems to have worked. I used an automated tool online - itweep - to clear the bulk. It wasn't perfect, but it was quick.

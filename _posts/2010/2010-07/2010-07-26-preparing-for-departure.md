I'm preparing to snap my laptop shut, wander home mid-afternoon, fold up some clothes, and head off to the south west with work for a couple of days. I will experience the delights of yet another poky hotel room for a couple of nights, and no doubt complain incessantly across the interwebs about it. I'm donning the teacher's hat once again. Time to pretend I know what I'm talking about in a room full of strangers, and wonder how professional teachers keep up the act. I live in fear of a pupil who knows more than me. This is of course an entirely baseless fear, but there it is. Destination? Salisbury. I've been there once. There's an amazing cathedral (hence the photo I'm sharing above - from the previous visit - that's W walking around), and of course just down the road is Salisbury Plain - home to Stonehenge. Somehow I expect my experience of Salisbury this time will be no more than my tiny hotel room, and perhaps a cafe nearby. Anyway. Lunch is over. Time to start thinking about shutting things down.

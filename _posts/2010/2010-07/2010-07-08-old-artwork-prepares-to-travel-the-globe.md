 After an email back and forth, it turns out the drawing isn't really what BlogHer are after for their auction, but it got me thinking... I wonder if somebody would like the drawing? Do I put it away somewhere for the girls when they grow up, or do I put it up for sale somewhere online? What do you think ?

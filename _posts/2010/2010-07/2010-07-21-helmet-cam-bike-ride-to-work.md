This will be interestingI tried out the tiny camera I bought last week this morningstrapped it to the top of my bike helmet, and recorded the journey.

It's a bit shaky in places (who knew a bike helmet gets thrown around so much!), but otherwise is incredibly good for a really cheap, really small camera. Not bad for a first attempt! Look out for the police clearing up a head-on car crash about 2/3 of the way in!

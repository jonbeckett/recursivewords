I've had an ideaan experiment of sorts. While playing around with stuff on the internet late last night, it occurred to me that rather than dictate where people read what I have written, it might make more sense for them to use whichever blog platform they preferI'll just cross-post to everywhere (actually, posterous will do all that hard work for me).

Sohere you gomy various ruminations on life, the universe and everything can be followed at the following locations;Posteroushttp://cheeseandbeans.posterous.com [http://cheeseandbeans.posterous.com/] WordPress http://cheeseandbeans.wordpress.comBlogger [http://cheeseandbeans.wordpress.comblogger/] http://cheese-and-beans.blogspot.comTumblr [http://cheese-and-beans.blogspot.comtumblr/]http://jonbeckett.tumblr.com [http://jonbeckett.tumblr.com/] Twitterhttp://twitter.com/jonbeckettPlurk http://plurk.com/jonbeckettFriendFeedhttp://friendfeed.com/jonbeckett  LiveJournalhttp://jonbeckett.livejournal.comIt's [http://jonbeckett.livejournal.comit's/] the same words and pictures appearing everywhere.

Don't know why I didn't think of this before.

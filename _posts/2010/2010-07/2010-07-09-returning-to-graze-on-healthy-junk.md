People who mistakenly find themselves reading my blog on a regular basis will remember me talking about the need to have some "me" time now and againand the hope that I might find some one weekend soon. Looking at the calendar todayover a week after I originally wrote itthe first "me" time will probably be next saturdaytwo weeks from the day I thought it might be a good idea. That's pretty quick for our house. Once upon a time I needed to take my iPhone to the store because it was brokenit took me two months to get there. So that's why I like things that arrive in the post. Getting them in the post means they actually happenrather than remain a "good idea".

I can't get away with anything thoughI ordered a box from Graze earlier, and didn't really think as I let it spam Twitter and Facebook with a free box offer to friends. An hour or so later, my other half chipped in on the facebook status "have you been buying food?". I guess I have to share it now.

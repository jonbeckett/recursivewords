I got up at 6am. Breakfast won't even be delivered to my room until 7:30.

Have no idea what to do with myself in the meantime. I'm washed, dressed, and bags are packedready to leave the hotel. Following another day pretending to be clever, I'll re-join the train network this evening to trundle home.

It turned out the hotel room wasn't actually that great after allthe hot water is competed for with the other rooms, meaning it varies between ice cold and scalding hot every few seconds. The air conditioning lets out random loud buzzing noises after it's been on for a few minutes, and carries on doing so for several hours after switching it off. The wifi signal at this end of the building is very marginal indeed I'm complaining about nothing really, aren't I. The bed was comfortable. The room was cheap. There's a TV, desk, my own bathroom, tea and coffee it could be far worse.

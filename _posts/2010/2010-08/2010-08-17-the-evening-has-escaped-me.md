It's nearly 11pm. I've been constructing a virtual machine all evening (in Sun/Oracle VirtualBox), with Alpha Five and MySQL on it for an upcoming freelance development job.

Alpha Five is very alien, but does some very clever stuff - kind of a RAD database interface tool - can do web interfaces too. Takes a little getting used to after so many years hand cranking HTML, Javascript, SQL, PHP, C#, or whatever else.

Anyway

Time for a coffee and some rubbish TV.

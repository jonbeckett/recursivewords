While figuring out how much money I had to buy lunch with today (hopefully more than I managed to find yesterday - none), I delved into all the various pockets of the backpack that accompanies me to and from work each day.

The coloured pencils kind of give away the presence of children in our house, don't they. I was stood in a meeting a while ago, and dipped into a pocket for something - and found a crayon and a hairband.

How do these things find their way into these places?

While tidying the kitchen up last night - in preparation for the arrival of three kittens on Friday - we lifted up the washing basket, and found a toy car. Our girls don't own any toy cars.

"Where did this come from?"

"Her future husband gave it to her"

Our youngest has already decided who she's going to marry. It's between four boys at the moment. They are all five years old. She changes her mind from week to week. No doubt the final days before the wedding will be rather nail biting for them.

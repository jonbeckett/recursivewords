It's Saturday morning, and the rain is falling.Hopes of cooking on the barbecue later have vanished.

The kids are watching movies (fuelled by chocolate spread on toast), W is still in bed, and I'm about to make the second coffee of the day.

Our "holiday" is slowly winding down to a close. On Monday I return to the office, and begin the trawl of my email. I could access it now, but am choosing to remain as far away as possible for as long as possible. I would rather not know.

Mission for the day? Perhaps catching up with blogs, social networks, friends, and online communities.

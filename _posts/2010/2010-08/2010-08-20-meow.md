First couple of photos of the kittens...

We have three - the third is hiding underneath one of the chairs in the lounge at the moment (I'm guessing he will show up when he gets hungry). Although I've only spent a couple of minutes around them, the differences in their characters is already pretty remarkable - one is friendly, one is timid, and the other is a little bugger.

Many more photos to come - when (a) I fell better, and (b) they are awake, and feel a little more at home. They are pretty nervous at the moment - having said that, none of them mind being picked up and fussed, which is a total change to "Simpson" who was famously bad tempered and occasionally randomly violent.

It just occurred to me that this is going to be my 150th post on Tumblr, so I thought a few words might be appropriate.

It's been slightly strange - writing a tumblog at the same time as a regular blog, posting thoughts to twitter, and catching friends on Facebook. It isbeginning to make some kind of sense though.

Twitter has become the bite size pieces of information - a few words shared with the passing crowd.

Tumblr has become the more fully formed ideas, thoughts, and rants - where some kind of justification or explanation was required. Tumblr is also the place where I find inspiration, and spend spare time - reading the thoughts, opinions, and observations of those I am choosing to follow (you're all great!).

WordPress is still the place I write the long form garbage - the navel gazing soap-box philiosophical verbiage about my day to day life. I note that I'm not writing there as often anymore though.

Facebook has become the place I avoid people. Old school friends, girls I once knew, and all manner of shadows from my past. I should perhaps "un-friend" the majority of them, but fear a backlash should I do so.

I'm guessing that - for me - Tumblr is here to stay. I've had several accounts over the past couple of years, I've experimented, and I've started over more than once. I keep coming back though.

There's something about the place that I like.

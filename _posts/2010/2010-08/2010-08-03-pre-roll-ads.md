Every time I see a video clip online that results in a pre-roll ad, I get no further than 2 or 3 seconds in before moving on.

When will the US TV networks realise that while their traditionally captive television audience might have put up with and got used to such idiocy, the rest of the world will not put up with pre-roll ads, 2 minute ads, 5 minute ads oh, what's the point.

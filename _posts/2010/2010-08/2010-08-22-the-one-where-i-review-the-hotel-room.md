Some might consider this post a surrender to boredom, and I would agree with them completely. Enjoy.

The room is at the end of a rather long corridor, which itself is at the end of a building which has been added on to in the same manner a child might when receiving new boxes of lego bricks for each new birthday. The floor height changes here and there signal the birthdays and christmases.

The room itself is pretty big. There's a bathroom with wet-room style shower, a huge wardrobe, a long desk, an enormous mirror, a table, and an arm chair.

I'm not sure who designs these tables for hotel rooms. It looks like a bullwark from a battleship - only skinnier. It weighs a similar amount (I imagine) though - perhaps table designers anticipate that the table may be placed outside in a hurricane, and should therefore exhibit tremendous stability ?

The armchair is scoop shaped, in the way that they always are in hotels. I've never seen one for sale in a shop; they must exist solely in hotel furniture outfitter's catalogues.

The television would be good if the reception was any good at all. It's utter crapness means I will most likely not switch it on at all this week.

I've not tried the bed out yet (slight pause in the authoring of this post while I first sit on it, then jump around enthusiastically). It's a good one. What's the deal with the forty thousand damn cushions on it though? Women do that too, don't they... I am reminded of the scene in "Along Came Polly" where Ben Stiller loses it with the cushions on the bed and starts killing them.

Better not do that.

Best part of the hotel room so far is the biscuits and hot chocolate - all of which I have consumed. While jamming an entire biscuit into my mouth earlier, I reasoned that I could make them last longer if I nibbled on them - but it was already too late - it was the last one. I'll try and remember tomorrow, but I can't promise anything.

Worst part about the room is the lack of air conditioning. It's unbearably hot, and there is no fresh air. I had the windows open earlier, but all manner of small flying things found their way into the room.

Oh - I have no mobile signal at all in the room, but I do have free wireless broadband. I guess that's a win of sorts. Calls home will be via Skype over the next week.

Tomorrow morning starts at 7 for me - with classroom antics beginning at 8:30. I'll no doubt have more adventures and tales of daring-do to exchange soon.

Watching the remains of Sunday vanish, and wondering what to do with myself. Choices at the moment seem to fall between;

Catching up blogs

Catching up with podcasts

Tooling around with Tumblr

Making a nuisance of myself on Twitter

Cleaning my walking boots

Polishing work shoes

Cleaning my mountain bike

Playing with Alpha Five (needed for a new project)

Not exactly an inspiring list, is it.

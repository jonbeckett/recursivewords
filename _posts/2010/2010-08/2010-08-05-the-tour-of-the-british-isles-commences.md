Tomorrow morning we depart Beckett Towers, and escape to higher ground and higher latitudes for a week of hill walking fun with W's parents and the children. It will be interesting to see how they cope with tired legs and very long, steep hills (probably better than the adults).

No doubt I will report during the trip on our various adventuresif not, expect lengthy and hopefully entertaining transcriptions from a notebook on our return.

Following my return from said adventures, I discovered today that in quick succession afterwards I will be frequenting hotels of various northern England destinations over the weeks to come in a pretend brainy person capacity (work). I have yet to tell W that I will be absent for much of late August and early September. I can almost imagine the grimace now.

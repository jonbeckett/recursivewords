I've come to realise that I'm more a consumer of Tumblr than a contributor. Sure, I post "stuff" every so often, but invariably I most enjoy looking at what other people are posting.

Being able to use Tumblr in such a way has relied on choosing an interesting and diverse band of content creators to follow - which I seem to have done so far.

Tumblr is interesting - the demographic is skewed towards teens and twenty-somethings, which brings with it hope, optimism, and angst - and yet is tinged with uncertainty, and the need for acceptance brought by youth. The tumblrati want to be noticed, but only on their own terms.

There are too many toys, and not enough time. With Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, and Posterous competing for my down time, this personal blog has been sadly neglected. Time to write something insightful, adventurous, and thought provoking? Perhaps.

Writing something interesting presumes I have anything interesting to volunteer. Bit of a problem there. Being a burb, living in a small town, working in a fairly normal job, with a fairly normal family life doesn't really contribute an exciting canon of adventures and experiences. Actually, tomorrow might provide something blog-worthy. I'm heading back into London on the morning trainrecounting the steps of my 2 year odyssey as far as Liverpool Street in order to put the "I'm clever, honest" hat on once more in front of other clever people (who I'm hoping won't see through the act). While I'm not looking forward to getting up early, I am looking forward to the commute in a bizarrely sadistic way. Commuting into the city for one day is like looking after children that are not your ownyou can enjoy the mayhem; safe in the knowledge that you will not be repeating it tomorrow.

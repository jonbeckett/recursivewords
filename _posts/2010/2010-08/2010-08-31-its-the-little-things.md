After setting out late this afternoon from the railway station in town, and having traversed Maidenhead, Paddington, and Euston, and Preston stations, I finally arrived at my destination.

It's perhaps the strangest hotel I have ever stayed in. In recent times I have become used to modern hotel designs; with every spare corner of a room used wisely. This hotel appears to believe in open spaces. My "room" is actually two rooms - one with a bed, a television, and a couch in it, and the other with a desk, a bathroom, a closet, and a trouser press.

Finding things that I expected to be "at hand" has been something of an adventure too - like tea or coffee making facilities. Who would have guessed the kettle and cups would be hidden under the TV in the bedroom? Why are they not on the desk, or near it - like any other hotel in the modern universe?

Oh - there are no biscuits either.

The cavernous bedroom has one light - near the door. To make it light enough to see across the room you have to switch on every single lamp in sight - none of which are brighter than about 20 watts.

I'm nitpicking.

The room is clean, the staff are nice, and things do seem to work. The food is hellishly expensive for what it is though, meaning I will probably buy food and bring it back with me tomorrow night. I dread to think what the pint of Guiness I bought earlier will have cost.

WiFi is not free in the hotel - which means I'm relying on a 3G dongle brought from home to get access to the internet. My regular phone has 1 bar of signal strength if I stand by a window. It is a consistent signal though, so I was able to call home.

I'm still nitpicking, aren't I.

Did I mention that I got fined on the train for having the wrong ticket (which was interesting, seeing as I bought the ticket a couple of hours earlier, specifically for the journey I was doing). I'll file an official complaint when I get back - see if I can get the money back.

I need to shut up, don't I - all I've done is bellyache and complain. Perhaps it has something to do with being away from home AGAIN - and knowing I will be missing the kids first day of school next week while away YET AGAIN. Hey - what am I saying. I have a job I'm well paid which is more than many can say.

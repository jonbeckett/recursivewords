It would appear that convention dictates the turning of the cogs behind the Tumblr Directory on a Tuesday necessitates the pimping of Tumblites that carry your favour.

Having only been present here for a few days, nobody has had a chance to turn my head yet - so it seems a little futile to choose favourites. Perhaps next week.

In the meantime, it's high time I wrote something in my sadly neglected personal blog.

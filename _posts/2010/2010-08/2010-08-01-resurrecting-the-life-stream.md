After a few months experimentation with life streaming earlier in the year, I feel that perhaps I curtailed it a little early. In recent weeks I have been wandering around the various long-form blogging solutions; WordPress, Blogger, LiveJournal, and of course Posterous, where "Cheese and Beans" lives - my personal blog.

Fitting Twitter, Tumblr, and Posterous together into a cohesive whole is therefore the problem to solve - if indeed it is a problem.

One of the great things about Tumblr is the community - thousands of individuals sharing their creativity, thoughts, and hopes with the passing world. Being a part of that community encourages you to be interesting - or at least more interesting than you otherwise might be while writing a blog post about a difficult day, or a humdrum week.

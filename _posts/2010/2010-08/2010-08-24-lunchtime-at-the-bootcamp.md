It's lunchtime of day two at the Combined Knowledge SharePoint 2010 Bootcamp, and it's been great so far. It's rare to be afforded the opportunity to learn a new product in seclusion - so I'm taking full advantage.

Evenings are being spent revising the course materials in hopes of passing an exam at the end of the week - which will give me some kind of certification (not exactly sure what - I don't think MCTS is still valid?)

Summary so far?

Loving the new features in Visual Studio 2010 for SharePoint packaging and deployment. Very nice indeed.

Still don't like the scripting in PowerShell. I understand it, but it doesn't mean I like it.

The new Client API is awesome - although not sure I will completely leave behind writing bespoke web services, purely for the unit testing and logging opportunities they present.

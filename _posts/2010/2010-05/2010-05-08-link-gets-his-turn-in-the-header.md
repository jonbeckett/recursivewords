I just took the entirely autocratic decision to install "Link" from the "Legend of Zelda" into the header of Cheese and Beans for the next month or so. Perhaps this could mark the start of a monthly rotation of something interesting in the header?

Geek alert - the next paragraph might be worth skipping over...

I just wiped my little netbook PC. Installing the latest build of Ubuntu on it a little while ago proved to be ill judged. Thankfully I don't use it for anything tremendously important, so wiping it to try out other operating systems has had no impact what-so-ever. It's been interesting to find out just how much I do use "the Cloud" to store information, and the lack of requirements I really have on a computer.

Geek alert averted - it's okay to continue reading now.

This saturday will probably go into the records as one of those days that didn't really happen. I found myself between children, housework, and mundane tasks throughout the entire day. I almost fell asleep on the couch at 8pm but have somehow woken up again now.

I suspect the several weeks spent working all kind of hours have contributed to my tiredness; and the sudden cessation has caused my body to shout "OK - TIME TO SHUT THE HELL DOWN".

Perhaps I should listen to it for a change.

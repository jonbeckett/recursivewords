I put the white Macbook up for sale on EBay this morning. We need the money more than we need yet another computer in the house. The auction is going off here if you are interested in buying it.

While sorting other stuff out, our 9 year old finally has a computer of her own. We had planned to give her the museum-piece Commodore Amiga from the attic, but the screen has blown a fuse. She now has the little EEE PC, a spare flat screen, and a keyboard and mouse I had lying around. In a fortunate twist of sorts, it's good enough to run Microsoft Word, but not good enough to watch YouTube, BBC or iCarly on the internet.

I was surprised at her reaction - or rather lack of reaction - to having her own computer. I would have been doing backflips at her age! What a difference thirty years makes.

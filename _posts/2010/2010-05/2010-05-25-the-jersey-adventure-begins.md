The day began at 5am when I woke, and quite surprisingly found myself wide awake. The alarm had been set for 5:30am. I watchedthe minutes tick by for a few minutes, and then slid out of bed, and quietly slipped past the childrens bedrooms.

As I passed Little Miss 5, I looked in and saw her sat upright in bed, wobbling around with her eyes open - not really awake at all. I smiled and whispered good morning - she collapsed back into the tangled heap of bedclothes.

Half an hour later while checking around before leaving, I passed Miss 9, who was awake and smiling at me as I passed the bedroom door.

"Goodbye Dad"

After a cuddle and a kiss, I clicked the front door shut, and left for the station. After the years spent commuting into London, the return to the train platform brought back many memories - chief among them that the ticket staff on our local train service should all be fired (another post for another day).

Perhaps more by luck than judgement, the trains connected, and delivered me to Southampton airport way earlier than I had expected. Given the presence of a rather nice restaurant in the airport, I did what any half sensible person would - ordered a full cooked breakast - my first in months - and pigged out.

Fast forwarding another hour, I had connected with my colleagues, we were checked in, and trundling towards the runway apron with the most cheerful sounding pilot in the known universe. I think commercial pilots must be put through some kind of elecution finishing school; where they learn "RAF English" - taught by wrote while repeating phrases dictated by Sir John Mills from 1940s era movies.

The flight was remarkably quick. As soon as the climb out finished, the cabin crew raced down the plane from both directions (a Dash 800 if you're interested), flogging cheap cigarettes and booze to anybody that wanted it. No sooner had they finished the swag run, it was time to strap back in for the descent into Jersey. Hardly worth bothering if you ask me.

The trip to the hotel (the Pom d'Or) provided entertainment by way of a taxi driver from North Yorkshire - "God's Own Country" as he described it - who knew everything, had been everywhere, and had an opinion on anything you mentioned. His exchange with the sales director was quite entertaining.

Having been for a wander to see the sea when we arrived, that's probably the last of Jersey I'm going to experience while here - the next two days are filled with meetings and workshops from dawn till dusk. This afternoon is filled with defragging the virtual environment I will be using tomorrow. How exciting (not).

In closing - a shot of Elizabeth Castle, on the edge of St Aubin's Bay - just off St Helier where I am staying...

The finish line is within site. For the past three weeks I have been working all day, returning home, and working most evenings - sometimes into the early hours. Weekends have not really happened for me.

The fruits of my labours was more or less completed today (and huge thanks go to my colleagues who also worked on the project with me - either directly, or in response to numerous inane questions from my about subjects I know nothing about - and there are many). The scary part happens on Monday when I arrive in front of clients to brief them, install what I have invented, and tutor them on it's inner workings. I'm crossing my fingers that all will go well, and the system will stand up (if you have no idea what I'm talking about here, some context might help - I'm a professional software developer in the daytime - I am one of the invisible army that designs and builds the systems that thousands of people in big companies use).

From late afternoon onwards I have almost continually exhaled. Although it sounds strange, I find myself at a loose end this evening. Apart from buying food on the way home from work, and sitting with the children until their bedtime, I am at a loose end - I don't know what to do with myself. I have spent so long now working through every spare moment, I seem to have forgotten how to "waste" time.

Suggestions ?

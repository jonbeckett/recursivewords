I'm sat in the lounge area of the Pom d'Or hotel in Jersey, just across from the marina. I have a couple of hours to kill before a final meeting, after which we head back to the airport.

It's been ever so slightly manic - after a first day where a meeting dropped out, leaving us free to explore the harbour area for a couple of hours, the last 48 hours have been head-down. This afternoon I am able to take stock once more before a final meeting, and then the flight home this evening.

I'm not sure I will ever be able to afford to bring the family to Jersey, and am not sure it's wonderful enough to want to do so - certainly not when two nights for one person in a hotel cost nearly 300 pounds (500 dollars).

I guess my perception of "expensive" has changed a lot since providing for a family of five.

Can't wait to get home now. You get "out of practice" at "being away", and so does the rest of the family.

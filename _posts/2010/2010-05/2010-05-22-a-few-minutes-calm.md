It's Saturday morning, and I'm enjoying a few minutes of calm before the rest of the weekend chews me up and spits me out. After today, I'm not expecting to get another chance to relax until we arrive on a campsite next weekend (I guess even then, it will be after we've put the tent up).

What's been going on in my world then?

The last week has been spent doing all kinds of web design work in my free time for people spread all over the world. It's been fun, and has reminded me how much I prefer doing "web work" than anything else.

Last night the dance company our kids are involved in did a big performance in town to several packed houses. I went to the first one with W's parents, and watched our youngest charm everybody with the biggest smile, bounciest pigtails, and wiggliest bottom on the stage. W helped back-stage, so I didn't get to see her much during the performance. During the second show she was summoned on stage to receive flowers 

Little Miss 6 arrived home at about 9pm last night (very late for her!), with stars in her eyes and music in her ears after her turn on stage.

I noticed something last night. Something unexpected. The older girls (about 16 years old) had choreographed a dance routine to a track by Lady GaGa. Although I kind of liked Lady GaGa in the past, hearing her music loud enough to make your body move turned me into a huge fan. Totally different experience to hearing it on an iPod, or a home hi-fi. Amazing voice.

Another observation from last night - two of the dancers from the entire company stood out hugely from everybody else. A girl in a pink tutu, and a boy with "perfectly scruffy" hair. I watched them throughout their routines, trying to figure out what it was that made them look so effortless, so much more graceful, and so much more elegant than anybody else. I'm sure the dance teacher could make a list a mile long of little things that seperate the talented from the good.

Anyway. The rest of the weekend is approaching. Better get on with something...

The journey home from work today was probably unremarkable. I say "probably" because I have quite obviously arrived home, and appear to be in one piece. I do not recall the journey home at all - only my arrival at the back gate of our house. It's amazing how your body can continue to function when your mind is otherwise engaged.

It's "probably" pretty dangerous to be cycling through traffic while thinking about software development problems too.

Walking through the back garden to put my bike in the shed, a small high speed blonde person in pink wellies appeared from beneath a sheet hanging on the washing line.

"Hello!"

"Hi Dad. I just goin' toilet."

Fine. I carried on a little, and discovered another little girl sat on a camping chair wearing a summer dress (which it transpires she had put on back-to-front), a warm coat, and wellington boots. Quite the ensemble.

"Hello!"

"Hi Dad. It's lovely and sunny today, isn't it?" (she said, visibly shivering).

A few minutes later found us all congregated around the dinner table. If there's one thing we do try and do every day, it's eat meals together. At the table. And the television is switched off at meal times. Yes, we are probably the most old fashioned,curmudgeonlyhouse in the street.

While waiting for dinner to arrive at the table, the topic of conversation somehow turned to dragons. Little Miss 6 (wearing the backwards dress) tried to tell me something about a wooden dragon at school that breathes fire on people being naughty. I asked what it's name was, and drew blank stares.

"Well of course dragons have names! What do you think would be a good name for a dragon?"

"Freddy!"

"Well I've never heard of a dragon called Freddy!"

"Billy!"

"Oh, now you're just coming up with anything ending in Y - Georgie, Timmy..."

She paused for thought, and looked high in the air. Her gaze focussed over my shoulder.

"Jug!"

"A dragon called Jug?"

"Yes! Look! There's one over there..."

You can't really argue with that kind of logic, can you. It's like saying you kicked somebody up the ass because it looked like your foot would fit.

When the children awoke early this morning and saw me walk past on the upstairs landing, they didn't greet me with "Dad!". They shouted "we got new chickens!".

In the photo above, you should be able to see "Mrs Chicken" (front, left), along with new additions "Henny", "Penny", and "Dotty". Dotty is the small black and white flecked one in the background.

I guess we're going to be eating a LOT of eggs from now on...

We went to the garden center earlier to buy food for the chicken - my attendance was required because my other half is not strong enough to lift the sack of feed.

While wandering around the garden center, four different people walked straight in front of me (while I was pushing an enormous trolley).

I'm coming to the conclusion I really AM invisible.

In the supermarket on Friday evening (while buying food for dinner), I got walked into by some woman while trying to call W. She blundered around a corner looking in her handbag, and crashed straight into me - knocking the phone from my hand.

In a moment on inspired hand-eye coordination I caught the phone before it hit the deck, and then received the following volley from her;

"Bloody people talking on bloody phonesbackpack on, in the middle of an aisle, and she had just walked into me, you can imagine my disbelief. I said nothing in return, and stared somewhat as she marched off even faster, and in even less control of her faculties.

I am wondering though - just how invisible I am.

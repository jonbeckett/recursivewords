If you're anything like me (and I strongly suspect you are not), you have all manner of accounts, spread all over the internet. I've been doing something about that over the last few days.

So far I have killed accounts at Friendfeed, Identi.ca, Plurk, Meebo, LiveJournal, Sprouter, Cliqset, Newsvine, Digg, Reddit, Bitly, BlogTV, Wolfsurfer, BlogExplosion, and a few more.

It feels strangely liberating - like lifting an invisible weight from my shoulders. There is an elephant in the room though.

Facebook.

What to do about Facebook? It's perhaps the least trustworthy of all the social networks - the current storm over information privacy has cemented it's position as the most dangerous place to share anything. If you thought "private message" on Facebook meant anything, think again... they're even selling information from those to third parties.

Losing Facebook will be significant unless I go through those I wish to keep in contact with, and actually expend some effort doing just that - keeping in touch.

Perhaps that's the problem - we've all become so lazy that we will choose loss of privacy over expending any of our own effort to communicate with friends.

It's scary.

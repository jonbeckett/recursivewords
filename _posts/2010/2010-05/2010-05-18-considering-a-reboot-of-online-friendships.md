CiX, Compuserve, innumerable bulletin board systems, Yahoo 360, Blogger, DiaryLand, LiveJournal, Vox, WordPress, Identica, Facebook, Cliqset, Plurk, Twitter... the list goes on and on. Places I have connected with all manner of people over the past fifteen years or so - places where friendships were forged as our lives crossed paths somewhere out in the electronic firmament.

Lately I have found myself at a crossroads. A crossroads forged by the indifference and transparency of others.

While reading and commenting on blogs recently, I have become a little less naiive. I notice that some recipients of my attention return automaton like to the places I write - unthinking, and unfeeling. Attention is given like a token from a meter. Cogs in my own mind started to turn.

These "people" - these voices half way around the world - who are they really? How much do they count? Are they really worth bothering with? How much do they care about others if it takes a prod of sorts for them to acknowledge the existence of others ?

Friendship is earned. Not traded.

I have wonderful friends I have met online - some of which have become friends in the real world too. I could name them, but I will not. They know who they are, and know I will continue to seek them out from time to time. They live in my ever shrinking blogroll, and among the sweaty masses of the social networks du jour.

The dilemma - what to do about the mercenary element? The attention seekers, and the written word prostitutes who's favour can be bought with a comment or a "like".

Perhaps it's time to say goodbye to many. A simple click will end their existence, and consign them to the memory of the search engine giants.

Perhaps it's time to remember those who really count - to visit once more and re-forge the friendships made long ago.

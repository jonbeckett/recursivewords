Yesterday was one of the most difficult days I have experienced professionally. I obviously can't explain much further than that for all kinds of reasons. At one point in the day I related my experiences to a superior, and received confirmation that "sometimes the world is just like that".

It's pretty dispiriting. The thought "is this as good as it gets?" comes to mind.

I got home (late), marched straight to the computer, connected to a far-away server, and carried on working. I stopped briefly to eat dinner, and returned once more.

The side effect of being invisible in my own house is that the kitchen - usually my job of an evening - looked like an atom bomb had hit it this morning. Given that the days are warming up, and flies are appearing en mass, you can imagine.

I have now not really spent any time with my own children since Sunday morning. Today is Thursday. Here's hoping the weekend will be filled with sunshine, and I can horse around with them outside. There are balls to be kicked, frisbees to be thrown, and running races to be had.

I can almost hear the bench in the playpark calling me. I need to go sit there - I've been running on empty for far too long now.

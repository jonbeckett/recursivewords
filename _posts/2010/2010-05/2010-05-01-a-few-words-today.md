The phrase "a few words today" reminds me of Immortal Beloved - the movie about the life of Beethoven, and his letters to a secret love who he eventually left everything to (it's a true story, if you're interested).

If only my life was as romantic!

This morning finds me preparing the children to go to "Rainbows" together for the morning single handed - my better half is off doing a charity walk so it falls on me to take all the children with me everywhere. I have a ten pound note, and a handful of change to my name.

For the last hour I have been attempting to get the kids organised - Sponge Bob Square Pants has been a wonderful ally throughout; at least keeping them in the same room while I brush hair, find socks, and so on.

Please don't rain. Please don't rain.

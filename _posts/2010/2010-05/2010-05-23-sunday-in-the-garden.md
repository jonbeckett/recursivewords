It's baking hot outside, so we're holed up on the house, doing homework, playing games, and otherwise hiding. I wandered outside briefly with the camera and snapped a few shots....

First we have Mrs Chicken - our lone surviving chicken that we hope to buy some friends for soon. Please don't feel sorry for her being alone - Chickens are incredibly brainless - when we introduce more she will no doubt bully them anyway.

The W House is still standing in the garden - I caught Little Miss 6 doing her housework early this morning (her version of housework typically consists of throwing everything into a huge trug).

Little Miss 5 appeared shortly after, on the commuter run from the W House to the back door. We keep thinking her buggy should be passed on to smaller children now, but concede that it may end up being kept for future generations as a "well loved toy".

The bees were busy pollenating anything and everything around the garden - catching one of them in a photo was more difficult than you might imagine.

So there you go. Our garden, early in the summer on a baking hot day. We were planning on having a barbecue, but it might not happen until late evening given the weather.

How's your Sunday going?

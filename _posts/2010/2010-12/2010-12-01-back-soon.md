Having completed the idiotic month of inconsequential blog posts, otherwise known rather ridiculously as NaBloPoMo, I'm slowing things down a bit.

It might be rather nice to only write when I have a story to tell once more, rather than scratching around for something to say.

Expect to find me on the social networks over coming days. This evening I connected Twitter to Facebook, highlighting the main problem for me at the moment; time. If I can contribute to Facebook purely by throwing off-hand SMS comments at twitter, it's all good, right ?

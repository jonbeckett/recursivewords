Apart from the obvious biblical references, most dictionaries define "Armageddon" as variations on "the end of all things", and that's exactly what has occurred for my technical blog.

For those of you that were not aware, for the past several years I have had two blogsthis one, and another called "Bag of Spanners" that contained all manner of code snippets, howtos, thoughts, and opinions on a variety of technical subjects.

Over the course of the last year or so, I had been sharing less and less through the technical blog, reducing it's value to anybody that might find it; the timespan within which technical knowledge has value is often very limited. It has also become more obvious over time that individual blogs are not the place to share such information; they are unstructured, and difficult for others to find.

So it is gone. "Bag of Spanners" is no more.

It didn't just hold programming though; among the many posts were some that expressed views and opinions that will stand the test of timethoughts about software development, technical books I have read, productivity, and project management methodologies. Professional stuff. Perhaps the basis for a "professional blog" ?

So it was that jonbeckett.posterous.com came into existence.

In way of explaining the thinking behind having both a personal and a professional blog, the first post provides some thoughts;

It's good to sometimes organise thoughts into writing - to rationalise, think through, and expound. (often incorrectly, but still...)

My friends and family aren't particularly interested in my thoughts on process design, design patterns, or interface design.

My professional peers certainly aren't interested in our cat's latest shock-and-awe victim, or how many teeth the kids still have left.

So there it is. Still two blogs. Still mad.

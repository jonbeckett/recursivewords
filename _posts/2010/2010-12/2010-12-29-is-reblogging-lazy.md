In recent days, while wasting time on the internet (something of a pastime around here), I have been reblogging the odd poster or cartoon that I liked. It doesn't really make for an interesting tumblr feed, does it?

In many ways I'm going against the use-case that I have employed here in the past; in my mind people on Tumblr are most interesting when they are original; when they share photographs of themselves, or their own story. Sharing pop culture material isn't about them - most times it's just a cynical ploy to attract attention - to increase followers.

Perhaps I'm being disingenuous. Perhaps not.

What do you think?

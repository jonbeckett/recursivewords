Tumblr is great fun, and the community is great, but do you ever feel that your life is just a little bit crappy from time to time, and that it's not going to be of interest to anybody, so why bother sharing anything? Especially if you know damn well that writing anything reallyinteresting will probably result in either your own family not speaking to you, or being hauled in for "a chat" at work

One of the penalties of being so amenable, so easy going, and such a great person to know is that you're quietly carrying the world on your shoulders you're quietly listening to others, being "the good listener", the "good friend", and you're just adding everybody elses crap to your load.

It's not always like that, but it feels like it sometimes.

Instead of buying an external hard drive for W to back her Mac up, I decided to be clever and bought a "Western Digital MyBook World Edition" - which is supposed to be a network storage device.

Complete. Waste. Of. Money.

It's going back whence it came under the terms of "not fit for purpose". Get this - it is advertised on the box as being gigabit ethernet enabled, yet has a transfer rate of about 1 megabit. If you do the math, that's hilariously bad. We're talking hours for a couple of gigabytes. Our photos, videos, and various other files weigh in at around 150 gigabytes.

The tell-tale in it's crap-ness is the network performance graph in Windows, which shows the data going through the box - even during download - starts out at perhaps 50 megabit, and then drops over time - this points towards all manner of buffer and memory limitations in the device.

Anyway - enough geekery. It doesn't work, and I'm annoyed.

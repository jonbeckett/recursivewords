For reasons best known to myself (read: I have no idea why), I'm building a new Tumblr theme - mainly because I didn't like the free ones I can find, and I'm a professional web developer

It's about half finished, and you're looking at it. Some bits and pieces I'll probably add over the next day or two;

Circular icons alongside the posts / quotes, etc, illustrating what they are - probably centered on the light grey border line of the left margin.

Navigation icons - probably hang a lightly shaded left and right outside the margins on either side.

Finish styling of chats, questions and answers, and so on.

Make all colours user configurable.

Allow configuration with Flickr, Twitter, etc.

Any feedback so far? Ideas?

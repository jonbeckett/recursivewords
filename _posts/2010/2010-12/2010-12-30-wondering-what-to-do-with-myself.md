It's the Thursday between Christmas and New Year, and I'm back in the office - wondering what to do with myself. I have no scheduled work as such, so I'm using the time to do housekeeping - registry cleaning, defragging and so on.

Time to draw up a list of diversions perhaps

Hit the "Directory" link in Tumblr, and search out interesting new people to follow

Hit the "Explore" link in Posterous, and similarly search for anybody providing interest and amusement

Weed out my blogroll from hell (seriously, it isthe blogroll from hell - and whittling it down should have happened a very long time ago)

Open up the multi-protocol IM clients and allow the world and their dog to engage me in riveting diversionary conversation.

Any more suggestions?

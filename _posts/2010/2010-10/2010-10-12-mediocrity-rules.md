I took a look at the visitor stats for this blog last night - hardly inspiring.

There is an easy explanation for the less than stellar figures - when I moved the blog to jonbeckett.wordpress.com, I didn't tell anybody. You might think this mad, but it was intentional; a way of finding out who was really reading.

Over the days that followed (the"Cheese and Beans" deletion), the steady stream of questioning emails, twitter posts, and facebook messages were a pleasant surprise. A validation of sorts that there are readers out there. Blogging isn't dead just yet.

In the great scheme of things, visitors don't really matter. I don't really matter.This blog is about me, my life, my story, my views. It's never going to be that interesting to others, and perhaps it shouldn't be. If somebody trips over it once in a while and writes a nice comment, that's fine - but I'm not going to go looking for attention.

So. There we have it. Mediocrity is a surprisingly comfortable suit of clothes that I wear rather easily, and requires very littlemaintenance.

This is all good, isn't it ?

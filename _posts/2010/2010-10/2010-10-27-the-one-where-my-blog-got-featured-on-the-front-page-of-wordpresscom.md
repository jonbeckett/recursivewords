While making drinks for my colleagues at lunchtime today, I was gazing out of the window (waiting for the kettle to boil) when a rather marvellous and totally random thought occurred to me.

It resulted in this;

That's my blog, appearing on the front page of WordPress.

Perhaps an explanation might be in order. When I got back to the office, I delivered the various cups of tea and coffee to their destinations, fired up wordpress, and described my idiotic thought for consumption by the world at large.

The post took all of 2 minutes to write. I peppered it with tags, and decorated it with a photo I took some time ago of my netbook at home. One click of "Publish" and it was gone.

Realisation didn't dawn on me until mid afternoon, when the comments started to roll in. Lots of comments. I popped Google Chrome open, and took a look at the visitor statistics for the blog.I believe I might have expressed my surprise with several colourful words.

Needless to say, appearing on the front page of wordpress really screws your traffic numbers. Thus far, readers of my incoherent ramblings have numbered in the 10s each day. Suddenly I am counting in the thousands.

A cynical part of me wonders how many will return tomorrow... and I'm bettingnot many. The funny thing is - until this happened I had been considering (for all kinds of reasons) slowly moving more towards Tumblr, and away from WordPress.

It's funny how the world works sometimes.

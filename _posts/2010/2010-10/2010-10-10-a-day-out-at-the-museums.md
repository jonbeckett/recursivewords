At 7am yesterday morning I turfed our eldest out of bed, threw her in the shower, and set about packing our backpacks for her first trip into London - to visitthe British Museum, theNatural History Museum, and theScience Museum. I guess ordinarily this would be the "motor racing" day out for many Dads, but for me this kind of thing is so much more interesting.

First obstacle of the day was perhaps the railway network, which Miss 10 thought was fantastic. Standing at one of the mainline stations, watching a through train rip past the platforms left her goggle eyed (the inter-city trains here do about 125mph). We arrived at Paddington some time after 9, and headed for the first of many toilet stops for the day... only to discover that it required exact change to get in... cue me running across the station to blow the cash I had in order to get coins.

Following an adventure on the London Underground, going via Oxford Circus to reach Tottenham Court Road, a few escalators and flights of steps brought us back into the daylight a few street corners from the British Museum, and the real reason we were there. Miss 10 is doing a school project on Ancient Egypt - and the British Museum has a vast collection (I'm keeping out of the argument over who SHOULD have the collection - although I tend to side with the Egyptians). Whatever - after walking into the Museum (and finding another bathroom), I pointed towards an open doorway from the central area, through which a statue of aPharaohcould just be seen. I had to run to keep up with her.

The next couple of hours were spent gazing at amazing statues, being taughthieroglyphicsby a ten year old, and shaking my head at her odd obsession with anything to do with the mummification process. She knows it all - right down to the extraction of your brain through your nose, and putting all your guts in Canopic jars... somehow I think her school project is going to be by far the most bloodthirsty.

Next stop was the Natural History Museum, following another adventure across the London Underground, and the promise of more dinosaur bones and stuffed animals than you could shake a many pronged stick at. I have no idea how much time we spent in the first gallery we came across - the "Creepy Crawlies" section - but it seemed like a lifetime (again, the fascination with anything horrible came to the fore). Following that it was time for lunch, and the first real problem of the day.

Two huge Museums, next door to one another. Many wonderful restaurants, and cafe's throughout - none of them taking card transactions. I therefore spent the best part of an hour trying to figure out where to get cash from to buy us something to eat. It didn't help that the only cashpoint for miles was being serviced... we ended up killing time in the Science Museum (or rather, I distracted Miss Ten with space rockets and astronauts while waiting for her inevitable "I'm starving and I can't take it any more" meltdown).

Isn't it amazing - what we do as parents - to head off conflict before it has even entered a child's head.

We did eventually get cash, and food, and pigged out in the bowels of the Natural History Museum - which was oddly fortuitous; our late arrival meant we avoided the many hundreds of screaming children we had seen earlier. One tuna salad, and caesarsalad later, we set off once more.

While queuing for the Dinosaur's she grew quite restless - wondering what all the fuss was about. That all got completely forgotten when presented with teeth as large as her hands, legs as tall as her body, and animatronic raptors. Point of interest (that I already knew about) - the Velociraptors in Jurassic Park are wrong - they are FAR too big. The reason for the queue lays at the end of the Dinosaur gallery - and is shielded from your eyes until you make a final turn to find out where all the floor-shaking growling and roaring is coming from - a full size robotic Tyrannosaurus Rex. I had trouble (a) stopping her eyes from popping out, (b) stopping her wetting herself, (c) picking her jaw up off the floor, and (d) dragging her out. I noticed at one point while stood right in front of it that her knuckles were white on the hand-rail. It totally made her day.

Except of course I had one trump card to play - the Blue Whale.

There is a fantastic book (that I would love for Christmas) called "Leviathan" about the construction of the Blue Whale in the National History Museum. It's a full scale model, accompanied by the skeleton that it's modelled on. It is surrounded by many other giants of the animal kingdom - Killer Whales, Elephants, Hippos, and so on. We spent the rest of the day in that hall, with all kinds of superlatives escaping Miss 10's mouth. A success, I think.

During our journey home, the universe seemed to smile on us; all the trains connected, and we made rapid progress home. The Underground was predictably idiotic, but was a good experience to show a child. I explained how the maps worked, how every train has the map printed inside it, and watched with a smile as my young charge kept glancing up, reading station signs as they whizzed past the windows, and counted down the stops to our destination.

With further perfect timing on arrival at home, I was just clearing the kitchen and starting dinner when we got a call from the rest of the brood, who were returning from their grandparents via the fish and chip shop.

Here are a few of the photos - enjoy!

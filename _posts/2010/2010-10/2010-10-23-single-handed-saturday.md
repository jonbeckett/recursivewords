Following the departure of Mrs Beckett this morning to watch the "Great South Run" with her Mum, I am single handed this weekend for the first time in ages.

It's going pretty well (so far).

Before 9 this morning everybody was fed, clothed, washing up cleared, kitchen clean, and there was a bedroom tidying competition going on - a masterstroke on my part, even if I do say so myself.

Following a morning of school projects, movies, and further tidying up attempts, lunch went without a hitch too - I sometimes wonder why children love cheese on toast so much though.

I had already promised the children a movie night tonight. For the children, this basically means they get to sit and watch a movie with me, and have the same food and drink as they might at the cinema (popcorn, fizzy drink, bag of chocolate buttons or something similar). The win for me is that doing it at home costs less for all of us than the cinema might charge for one of us.If I had to escort the children to the toilet in the middle of the movie, the experience would be complete.

Heading out to buy popcorn earlier, we stopped at the big playpark in town for an hour (hence the photo accompanying the post). Cue an hour of following them around the park, lifting them on things, lifting them off things, and covering my eyes at their death defying antics. Perhaps the most entertaining was when Little Miss 6 shouted "Dad, watch this!", and nearly fell 8ft out of a climbing frame.

As I caught her - mid fall - I asked "can you do that again - I didn't see it", to which she replied "that's NOT FUNNY!"

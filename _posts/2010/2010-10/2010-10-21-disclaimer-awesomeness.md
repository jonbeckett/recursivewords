I threw a disclaimer page onto this tumblog earlier this morning (in reality, it's a mashup of several other disclaimers that I found online). I guess covering your own ass is a wise thing to do these days.

I particularly like the "short" version, which reads thusly

This is a blog. That fact means nothing. It is not a peer-reviewed journal, a final archive of my writing, a sponsored publication, or the product of gatekeeping and editing. That does mean something it means that while the ideas and thoughts are often vital and the product of a long gestational period, the writing itself is not. It is essentially as it came from the keyboard: spontaneous, unproofed, unrevised, and corrected afterward only when necessary to address mistakes that grossly effect the intent. Where such changes have been made they are explicitly noted It would be distinctly unwisenot to mention uncharitableto play connect-the-dots with my physical life and work and my "life of the mind," as scanty as either might be. My attitude at work, my reaction to ideas, your grade (good or bad), the length and tone of my discussion at the coffee pot, the intensity and duration of my lovemaking, the time it took for me to return your letter or email, and the quality and quantity of my response to you in any medium are probably not tied to anything you read here at least not in a way that you will be able to confidently assume without sharing years of psychotherapy and the bills that come with it. I'm a human being and my blog reflects that humanity.

There is also a longer version, which you can read here if you really want to be entertained (sarcasm intended).

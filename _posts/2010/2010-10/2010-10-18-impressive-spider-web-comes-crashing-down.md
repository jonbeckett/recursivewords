I just wandered into the kitchen and discovered a 2ft diameter spider web hanging across the room - suspended on a masterpiece of spider architectural achievement; lines of web stretching out across the room.

I wondered how I had managed to walk across the kitchen without getting a face full of spider (the spider was about 3cm across), and then realised I had walked through a gap in the supporting threads

Impressive stuff.

Given that the girls would have screamed the place down in the morning had they seen it, I grabbed the broom and evicted the spider to the back garden - it lives to spin another day.

Given that I have to get up at stupid o'clock in the morning to go sit the Microsoft exam from hell, I'm wasting the end of this evening surfing Tumblr for new and interesting people.

I could sit and half-watch one of the movies I rescued from the bargain bin at Blockbusters the other day;

A Serious Man (the Cohen Brothers one)

Bright Star (the one about Keats)

Every time I walk past their store something tells me I should go buy cheap movies, because they're not going to be there much longer; the US arm has already gone into administration, and the UK can't be far behind the store hasn't been fitted out for years.

Anyway back to the Tumblr surfing it's important business, you know!

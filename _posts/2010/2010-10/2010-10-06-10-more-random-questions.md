In keeping with the recent theme of answering random questions, I thought perhaps it might be time for another ten - enjoywe found ourselves with the dance floor all to ourself, and had such a great laugh. The next morning, while sitting through the briefing for a port visit (Naples, perhaps?), an elderly lady tapped W on the shoulder and remarked "I did enjoy your exotic dancing last night"...

Would you ever consider living abroad?

I would, W wouldn't - and now we have children at school, it's gone completely off the radar. A few months before meeting W I was all set to emigrate to west coast America. At the time the dot com boom was in full swing (and about to crash), so perhaps it's not such a bad thing that the machinery of the universe kicked in and kept me here.

Does your name make any interesting anagrams?

After doing a little googling, I just discovered all manner of crap that I would otherwise never have known - apparently my name can be rearranged into the following; "A Tenant Job Ketch", "Cab Take Tent John", and "Banjo Cat The Kent". Who knew!

Who made the last incoming call on your phone?

W - while trying to find me in the shopping centre on Monday. I wandered off with my Dad, leaving my Mum and Wend peering around in search of us. I got accused of trying to avoid a school Mum that had just apprehended W outside a clothes shop.

What is the last thing you downloaded onto your computer?

Struggling to think what it might have been. Probably a graphics app on the laptop called "GIMP", in order to manipulate a photo for a website design the other evening. I tend to use Ubuntu on the laptop because it just works...

Last time you swam in a pool?

We took the children swimming a couple of months ago - which caused the memorable quote from our eldest - "how come you're not fat like the other Dads?" (I'm taking that one to my grave).

Type of music you like most?

Difficult to say - my musical moods change with the wind. I tend to like quiet, thoughtful songs by singer songwriters - so have lots of stuff by the likes of Kate Rusby, Dar Williams, Cara Dillon, and John Mayer. That being said, I love Owl City too, which is very different. Also love lots of the 80s stuff - Nik Kershaw, Howard Jones, Go West, etc.

Type of music you dislike most?

Rap. Probably because I don't think it requires any skill other than not being able to shut up. It doesn't "speak" to me at all.

Are you listening to music right now?

Yes. The soundtrack from "Hope Floats". Crappy movie, but the music is pretty good for a relaxed night in (W is having some kind of girls night out).

What color is your bedroom carpet?

Kind of a worn out beige. It's the same carpet that was in the bedroom when we moved in. Our bedroom will most likely be the last room we ever decorate - we always put ourselves last. Needless to say, the kids have great rooms.

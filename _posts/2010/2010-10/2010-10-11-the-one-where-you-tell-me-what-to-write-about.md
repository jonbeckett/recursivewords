While struggling to come up with anything informative, candid, or entertaining to share with the loyal readers of this blog earlier (both of them), a rather marvellous idea occurred to me.

Why not let the readers suggest things to write about! If you've ever wanted to know something about me, this is your chance. Be brave - ask away. I will endeavour to answer all questions (within reason), and/or impart views and opinions on suggested subjects.

A quote comes to mind;

be bold, and mighty forces will come to your aid

Goethe

I wonder how true it might be? Ask away...

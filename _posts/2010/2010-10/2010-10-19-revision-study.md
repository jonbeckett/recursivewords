Apart from half an hour wandering to the school and back this morning in order to delivery the children to their various places of learning, I've been shut away in the study at home all day - revising for a Microsoft professional certification test tomorrow.

If you're at all interested, it's the "PRO: Designing and Developing Microsoft SharePoint 2010 Applications" exam. I've had my nose in the book, on MSDN (Microsoft Developer Network), and looking at various freebie test questions I could find here and there - and think I'm about as prepared as I will ever be.

In the past I've gone into these tests stressing about getting as close to 100% as possible, but this time the drive just isn't there... a pass is a pass. Preparing for the test teaches you a certain amount, but it's nothing like real world experience.

You only really learn a lot about something when you're trying to build something.

So that was my day really - not what you might call exciting.

Will try to be more entertaining soon.

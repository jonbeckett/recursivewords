It's the weekend before "National Blog Posting Month" begins, and I've been picking away at a freelance project throughout most of the day.

I have absolutely no idea what I'm going to fill the annals of this blog with for the next 30 days, but I can't imagine it's going to be that difficult. I write almost every day anyway.

In many ways, appearing on "Freshly Pressed" did me some good - it reminded me how awesome the blogging community is, and reaffirmed why I do this - why I share. It's sometimes easy to forget that some people are reading your words, they are taking notice, and that your contribution isn't entirely useless.

The great victim in this realisation will be "jonbeckett @ tumblr" - I had been contributing quite a lot to the Tumblr blog recently. The big problem with Tumblr - which you can chose to either ignore or not - is the essentially shallow experience. The age group and mentality of the Tumblr community is younger than the rest of the blogging community, and therefore more self occupied. I'm not saying this is a bad thing - just that it's the way it is.

Anyway. I promise to try and keep away from navel gazing posts (such as this one) over the next 30 days. The challenge for me will be to write original, entertaining, and interesting posts - perhaps not always slice of life, and perhaps not too controversial.

Is this the beginnings of a manifesto for "genteel blogging" ? Maybe it is.

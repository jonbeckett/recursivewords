Have been revising solidly since 9am (after taking the kids to school). Now 2:15pm. Stopped for 10 minutes for lunch earlier. Still have a mountain to climb in terms of the material I want to cover for the exam.

Oh - and I moved the exam forward to tomorrow morning because there was a free slot in a nearby test center.

I am such an idiot.

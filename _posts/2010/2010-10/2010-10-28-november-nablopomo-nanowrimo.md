It just occurred to me that the title of this post might make you wonder about my spelling skills. I obviously can't spell November at all. I can't even lay claim to one of the cats walking across the keyboard - they are nowhere to be seen.

In truth, I couldn't think up anything clever or witty, so reverted to that which I know best, which has been occupying most of my waking hours lately, and which almost explains the reason I'm writing this in the first place - programming.

First, let's clear the non-anagrams up;

NaNoWriMo = National Novel Writing Month

An annually organised event where people try to write a 50,000 word book during the 30 days of November.

NaBloPoMo = National Blog Posting Month

An annually organised event where people try to write a blog post every day during the 30 days of November.

In reality, NaBloPoMo has become an "every month" event, which I think is a bit sad. I took part in the first running on NaBloPoMo about five years ago, and made all manner of friends through it - some of which I still have today.

I had been kicking around the idea of attempting the more idiotic challenge this year - that of writing a 50,000 word novel - principally because I am an idiot. Faced with lots going on at home and work, even I can see the futility before I start.

I think therefore pragmatism laziness wins.

I will be writing 30 blog posts during November. One a day. They will vary between unquestionable brilliance, and deplorable rubbishness (yes, I know "rubbishness" is not a real word).

If you're interested in joining me on the journey, or you were already planning on doing it, head on over to the NaBloPoMo website, and add me as a friend - let's be idiots together.

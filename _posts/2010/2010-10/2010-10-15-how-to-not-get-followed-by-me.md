While doing a little social network expansion today, I've been looking at a lot of Twitter and Tumblr profiles. It occurred to me while reading that there are particular things that cause me to completely disregard a profile;

Any mention of God or Jesus

Any mention of skills around Social Media

Any mention of being anything to do with Marketing

Any mention of being an SEO "expert"

If you avoid all of those, and contribute interesting, original content, I'll most likely either find you, or follow you back. Simple really.

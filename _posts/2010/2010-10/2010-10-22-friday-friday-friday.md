What is it that's so good about Fridays? Actually I take that back. The weekend is coming, and my other half is going away - leaving me to look after the children, cats and chickens single handed.

Bang goes any thoughts about doing anythingfor myself for the entire weekend. I'm going to be chief washer upper, tidy upper, clothes washer, cook, argument resolver, judge, jury, and Dad

I guess I should buy something nice to eat and drink on the way home, because I won't get another chance (at least without taking the kids with me - then you face the barrage of questions "why are you buying that can we have that").

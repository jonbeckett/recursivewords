Continuing on with the recent theme of answering random questions, here's another ten things you never realised you wanted (or didn't want) to know about me, but will if you read to the end.

This blog is just full of champion stuff at the moment, isn't it ?

When did you last laugh?

This morning.

Do you remember why / at what?

While making breakfasts and lunches for the children, our eldest daughter put bread in the toaster and then busied herself with getting in everybody else's way. When it popped up I shouted "toast is done" - and she looked towards the dinner table with a questioning look. "It's in the toaster!"... she obviously expected her involvement to have ended at putting the bread in the toaster.

What is on the walls of the room you are in?

Nothing. I'm sat at work (early - I got a lift in, because my mountain bike is off the road), where I face a blank wall. While this sounds bad, it's actually remarkably useful for retaining focus.

Seen anything weird lately?

I'm guessing this very much depends on what you qualify as "weird". Does weird include the rather ambitious spider web we saw yesterday morning? Some kind of bionic super-spider had managed to absail ten feet across the garden from the trees to the washing line, and construct an amazing web. On any normal morning it would have been invisible, but given early morning frost and fog, it hung across the garden like some kind of architectural display of prowess.

What do you think of this quiz?

It's rather random - but then my main requirement is to write something of interest for a blog post, and this avoids me having to dream something up. Apparently people like lists of random stuff.

What is the last film you saw?

Late one evening last week after finishing some freelance work, I caught "The Girl in the Park" starring Sigourney Weaver, and got completely sucked in by it. It's about a woman who loses her young child, and then years later befriends a young woman who she becomes more and more certain is her daughter. Of course it didn't help that I ended up not hitting the sack until about 2am.

If you could live anywhere in the world, where would you live?

No idea at all. I'm pretty happy where I am. To be honest, location isn't something that ever crosses my mind; I use the internet to keep in touch with most people - and that obviates any requirement to be anywhere in particular.

If you became a multi-millionaire overnight, what would you buy?

I would probably buy a better house. Ours is pretty old, and needs a fair bit of work doing to it - which we won't be able to afford for years - by which time there will be more things that need doing.

Tell me something about you that most people don't know.

I'm red green colourblind. I can see postbox red, and grass green, but the inbetween shades are a real problem. When working on graphics and artwork I get by through knowing the make-up of the colour I'm using.

If you could change one thing about the world, regardless of guilt or politics, what would you do?

I would remove religion, because it has been the chief cause of pretty much all the animosity, suffering, anger, and war that has existed throughout human history. Even writing this will cause objection, which kind of proves the point.

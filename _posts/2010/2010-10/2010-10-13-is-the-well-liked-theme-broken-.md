Just playing around with the themes in Tumblr - it would appear the "well liked" theme by Peter Vidani (the one you're looking at) is broken - and I'm not entirely sure what causes it certain content causes the formatting to go completely mad.

Do I really need to solve ANOTHER bug in ANOTHER theme for somebody else?

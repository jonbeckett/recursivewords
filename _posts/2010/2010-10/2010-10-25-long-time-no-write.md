Yes, yes, I know I post random crap here almost every day at the moment, but I haven't really written anything of substance for quite some time.

I've been working on a freelance project all evening - building a website for a company I've worked with before. Part of it has involved reverse-engineering another site their parent company already has always fun (not). The new site is based on Drupal, so that's working out quite well to keep at least one toe in that pond.

Holy crap am I tired though. Working on C#, HTML, and CSS all day - and then carrying on with content management crap throughout the evening probably isn't the best plan in the world, but it's paying our bills at the moment, so I'm not really in a position to complain.

Work work work. That's the story for my life at the moment.

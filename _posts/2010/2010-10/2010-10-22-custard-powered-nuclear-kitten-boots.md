I've been thinking more about participation in NaNoWriMo.

Not really thinking more idle daydreaming.

I probably willparticipate, but my participation will probably take place late at night. I wonder if anybody else has ever completed NaNo while only writing from midnight onwards each day?

I have no plot, no title, and no plan. It's going to be completely random.

I did have half an idea - a rip off of JPod, or Microserfs (both books I love), but figure I could get in trouble if the characters are too close to people I know (I'm a software developer in the daytime).

At this rate, it looks like the "Custard Powered Nuclear Kitten Boots" story is actually going to happen.

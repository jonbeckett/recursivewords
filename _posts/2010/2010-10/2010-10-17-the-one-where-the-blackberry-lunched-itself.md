While sitting on the bedroom floor of our eldest daughter earlier this evening, the Blackberry popped up a notice reminding me that FourSquare had a pending update. I clicked "OK". That was a mistake...

"Reload Software: 552C/3... wonder what that means?

An hour and a half later, I have formatted the phone, re-installed the applications, and re-connected most of the data on it. Nightmare.

The only disasterous loss of data has been the friends I had listed in Blackberry Messenger. All of my contacts, calendar entries and email re-synched itself through Google Sync in moments.

To be fair, it's the first real problem I've had with the Blackberry (apart from the browser being unspeakably rubbish, and it not having 3G).

I'll try not to fiddle with the damn phone any more before I junk it when the contract ends.

Somehow the house has returned to some kind of calm place this afternoon (after a mayhem filled morning). I'm sat in the lounge, listening to Linux Outlaws, having a drink, and basically chilling out before I make dinner a little later.

Being on my own with the kids this weekend has had it's moments - both good and bad. It's interesting how you don't remember the angry moments, but you do remember the happy times

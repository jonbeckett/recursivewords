A few days ago I invited the readership of this blog (both of them) to suggest topics, or fire questions at me as a basis for subjects I might cover in the near future. The suggestions received so far have been pretty predictable; "How are the kids doing?", and "How are the cats doing?".One subject stands out - my spirituality, or theology.

I have never written much about my beliefs or faith in the past, perhaps it's time. It's such a huge subject - even approaching an answer almost requires an essay to properly do it justice.

Why would I want to write an essay? To present my thoughts in a robust enough manner to prevent them being questioned. Why would I deem it necessary to construct such a defence ?

Because I don't believe in any form of God, or Gods.

That's not to say I don't find theology as a subject interesting - over the last few years I've read a number of books about theism, philosophy, and ancient history. I continue to find it interesting that I am in a massive minority, and often struggle to understand whyso many people believe what they have been told to believe.

I would never question the beliefs of another (each to their own, as they say), but I do object to people either preaching their beliefs, ornaivelypresuming that everybody else shares their beliefs. I also object to the "me too" school of thought that many people with a faith use as a crutch; finding validation for the belief they have chosen purely because many others share it.

Perhaps there is an element of anarchism here... by the same token that I often play "devils advocate" in conversations, am I not rebelling against the structure and methods organised religion relies upon?

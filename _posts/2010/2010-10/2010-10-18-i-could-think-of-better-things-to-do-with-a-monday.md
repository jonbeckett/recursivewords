Today finds me revising for a professional exam at work. It was going to be on Wednesday, but that's now skidded out to Thursday. It remains to be seen when I will actually sit down and do the exam.

While watching "The Social Network" the other evening, watching Mark Zuckerberg pumping thoughts into LiveJournal got me thinking about the way I use WordPress, Tumblr and Twitter. I used to use WordPress more as a lifestream - with lots of random, short posts, and the occasional essay. These days, WordPress only gets the considered, longer form garbage; Tumblr and Twitter get the short stuff.

Thinking about it, Tumblr invariably gets anything longer than a sentence - Twitter gets the shouted conversation in the middle of a noisy party, where nobody's really listening but it's good to be there in case anything interesting happens.

I don't really know why I continue to use Tumblr. It's fun, I guess. Fun is good... isn't it?

Sat here listening to some kind of rubbish electronic wallpaper music on WinAmp, and can't be bothered to find out what it is, or to change the channel. That's pretty damn lazy, isn't it.

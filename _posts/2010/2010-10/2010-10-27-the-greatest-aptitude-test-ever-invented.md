While making a drink for my colleagues this morning, a thought popped into my head - an idea for the best aptitude test ever invented for interviews - a text adventure game from the 1980s.

Wouldn't it be great if you could land a job applicant in a game such as Zork, or Colossal Cave, and watch their progress remotely - watch them figure out the puzzles. It would be a great way to see how their mind works.

If you've never played a text adventure, there are lots of them online, and lots you can download. Here are a few;

Zork 1 - The Great Underground Empire

Zork 2 - The Wizard of Frobozz

Zork 3 - The Dungeon Master

Have fun

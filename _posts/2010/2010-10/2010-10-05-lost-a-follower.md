I just noticed I lost a follower. While this wouldn't be important, if you only had 65 followers to begin with, it's the same as losing a chunk of chocolate from a 250g bar.

(in reality, I don't care at all - I just have nothing else to write about)

Should really be getting on with writing the most boring function in the universe. Something is stopping me from doing so.

If any of the tumblrsphere had a brain in their head, they would be forwarding me for "Tumblr Tuesday", because I'm so flipping amazing. Stop laughing.

One of my colleagues just informed me he purchased an app for his iPhone called "Hippo Remote".

"Does it let you remote control Hippos?"

"Well it does just about everything exceptthat"

"I'd be pretty bloody annoyed if I had spent 99p on an app called 'Hippo Remote' and it didn't let me go to the zoo and remote control the Hippos"

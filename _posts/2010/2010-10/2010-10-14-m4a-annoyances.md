I fucking hate it when I try to post a monumental song and I can't because it's not an mp3. Jesus Christ, Tumblr, are you too good for m4a or something?

No it's because m4a files (despite Apple's protestations to the contrary) are typically polluted with digital rights management crap.

Your blog is great btw.

It's just gone midnight, and I've finally downed tools for the evening not that I really hadan eveningor a day for that matter.

Most of the day consisted of headbutting a brick wall repeatedly, trying to figure out why a particularly troublesome piece of code wasn't behaving itself (converting an encryption function in .

NET to PHP if you're at all interested). While doing that, all manner of other draws on my time landed on me, effectively burying me while the phone rang. Thankfully the wonderful girl who sits behind me was celebrating her birthday today, and had bought cakes.

Why docakes make everything better?

This evening hasn't really been much of an improvement. I got in, ate some leftovers (W and the girls had already eaten), tidied the kitchen up, and then carried on with work for the next five hours. Fun (not).

Being honest, I didn't mind working late this eveningI did it off my own back because I wanted to get ahead, and I don't want to feel bad about having tomorrow morning off. Our middle girl is leaving infant school tomorrowit's her last day. I've been invited to the "leaver's assembly".

I guess I should get some sleep. It's nearly 12:30am.

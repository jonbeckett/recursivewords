It feels like I haven't written much in here for daysor when I have written something, it's just been captions to go with a few photos. Am I losing the will to write a blog? Hard to say.

I've gone through barren periods like this before. This time it's almost certainly down to a few things;Work has been really busyto the extent that I've worked a couple of evenings unpaid because I couldn't get what I was working on out of my head.

Home life has been crazyoften resulting in burning the candle too lowreclaiming "me" time by staying up far too late, and then being tired the next morning as a result.

Google invented a new social network called Google+, and it has burned up lots of my laughably "spare" time. It's so much better than Facebook it's almost funny.

So there it isthis cocktail of work, home, and social networking are transpiring to resign the blog to afterthought status at the moment. I'm sure it won't stay that way for long.

What else has been going on? There must be moreAh yes. It turns out that perhaps my closest friendwho lives about 300 miles awayis going on holiday to the same place as us, at the same time as us. It was completely unplanned. Suffice to say I'm now looking forward to going on holiday rather a lotwe don't get to see each other very often at all.

While writing this, I'm half watching W's MacBook, which was resurrected today with the delivery of a new power wire. It's chugging it's way through 1.5Gb of software updates from Apple. I'm debating about installing the OSX Lion upgrade on it. Not sure how much trouble it might cause with legacy apps.

Ah. Just discovered I don't need to update it. Arse. Downloading Lion right now.

I can't quite believe it's been so long since I last wrote a blog post. I'm note quite sure what might be most to blame; life, social network distractions (yes Google+, I'm looking in your direction), or a colossal attack of apathy.

The most recent "reason" for my absence began the night before last. The phone rang, and after a few minutes of chatter, W wandered in and handed it to me.

"It's your cousin"

The one from San Francisco, that I spent so many holidays kicking around with. As Forrest Gump might have put it, we "was like carrots and peas". I'm not sure if she toldme she was coming, but then you never really know with her... she's one of those people that the rest of the world seems to revolve around - or at least that what she expects.

"Hi, I'm leaving for the airport in an hour, and will arrive at Heathrow at about 1pm in England tomorrow - I thought I might come see everybody"

Putting family up for the night isn't our problem. Keeping our prospective house guest a secret from three little girls who adore the ground she walks on is our problem. Unbeknown to me, W told them on the way to school the next morning.

When I arrived home from work it was almost adisappointmentfor the children. I wasn't her.

Needless to say she didfinally arrive, and I haven't seen our house so happy in a long time. Even this morning the usual breakfast/lunch/school run routine seemed to require far less chasing, shouting, and threatening than normal. I guess having a favourite cousin from America eat dippy eggs with you, and help you brush your hair suddenly makes all the boring things fun.

By turns we all left the house for school or work, and left her to catch her train towards Cornwall later in the day. When my turn finally came I had the requisite huge huge, accompanied with promises to keep in touch more often (which I know I am terrible at), and went on my way.

I got on my bike, turned on a podcast in my ears, started turning the pedals, and reality resumed.

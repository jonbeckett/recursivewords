I should have guessed today was going to slip by unnoticed when I woke up half an hour late this morning. Actually, that's not the whole truth; I woke up when I should have, turned the alarm off, and went back to sleep.

Not very clever.

We eventually scraped ourselves out of bed at 7:30 and I headed off to the girls bedrooms to draw the curtains and wake them up. Although I'm usually pretty groggy, it's my favourite part of the day - seeing them open their eyes, sit up in bed, rub the sleepy away, and smile at me while squinting at the sunlight flooding the bedrooms.

On a good day the kitchen resembles a military operation - breakfasts and lunches are neatly assembled and lined up on the counter for little people to take away. Not this morning. This morning was more like the LA Riots - and that was just W making the lunches.

I'm not sure if it's just me being a "tidy" maniac, or everybody else in the world being untidy - but (as I discovered this morning), it even extends to making packed lunches. Lining the sandwich boxes up. Putting olive spread, cheese, ham, and various other sandwich fillings back in the fridge as soon as you've finished with them... it seems natural to me, but apparently not to anybody else.

Somehow we survived dancing around each other in the kitchen for the best part of an hour, and tipped each other out of the house in enough time to get to our various destinations on-time (or in my case, early) - just like we do every day.

The rest of the day has unfolded on auto-pilot.

Work was good - even though I had a number of meetings, I still managed to crank out quite a bit of code, and have somehow made the rest of the week much easier than it might otherwise have been for myself.

After going through the usual tidy up, dinner, play, bedtime routine this evening single handed (W went to a school function), we had planned on watching "2012" - the hilariously rubbish disaster movie. Only we didn't.

For the 1033rd time, the rented DVD that came through the post had a scratch, that prevented us watching it. We're very close to cancelling our account now... we pretty much wasted an hour of our evening. The part of the movie we did see - the first half - looked entirely forgettable anyway, so perhaps the scratch was a blessing in disguise.

It's heading towards midnight here. I guess I should shut the computer down, attempt to sleep, and then have some hope of getting up when the alarm goes off tomorrow.

Do you ever feel like an automaton? I do...

It's heading towards lunchtime on Saturday morning, I've already walked into town once (to pick up a parcel from the sorting office that they couldn't be bothered to deliver to the house), and am now trying to figure out what on earth I'm going to make myself for lunch.

The kids are out with W - at a school fete, my in-laws are turning up in about an hour, I have to somehow connect my mother-in-law with W (give her directions to walk in the direction of the school), and then accompany my brother and father-in-law to the local brewery for their "open weekend" - connecting with friends along the way, to meet them there.

Tomorrow is more of the same; except we're driving over to visit them in Oxfordshire to go out for lunch.

The various things going on mean I will miss qualifying for the British Grand Prix, and the race itself. I will also not be able to go and get a new headset for using with Google+ hangouts (which are excellent, btw).

This is where I admit that I just ordered the headset from Amazon, along with some kids DVDs - they are for the children, honest.

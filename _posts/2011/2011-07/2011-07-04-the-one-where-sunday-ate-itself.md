I swear, Sunday didn't happen. I have vague recollections of it being talked about, and things might have happened, but I'm not entirely sure any more.

I remember getting up fairly early, and endless streams of children running around the house. I clearly remember a little asian girl creeping up behind me in the study, and roaring at me when I noticed her.

By 9:30am I was out in the playpark with the children once more, throwing balls, frisbees, chasing them, taking part in running races, and pretty much being the "only Dad out there" yet again. The upside is that all the children know who I am nowthe downside is that all the children know who I am now. Coming home from work on an evening means I have an entourage of small children running alongside or waving while their quizzical parents look on.

We have forged a new friendship with a neighbour thougha nice Australian guy that lives across the green, and offered to take the children into town with him. Somehow they came back with pencil sharpeners. Not quite sure how that happened.

Following the usual bath and bedtime child wrangling activities, my entire evening was eaten up with various attempts to untangle my archive of blog posts from WordPress. I can get them outthey are just corrupted enough to not import into anything else. I don't think "annoyed" is quite the word at the moment. I have trusted WordPress for years, and this was a bit of a shock.

I created virtual machines running all manner of other blogging platforms to see if they would import the content, and all of them failed. WordPress, Drupal, TextPattern, Habari, MoveableType, B2Evolution you name it, I tried it, and in the end wasn't surprised at all when they failed in some gigantic way.

Anyway I'm supposed to be working (or am I? I notice from the project planner at work that I have half a day off. I don't remember booking it, but I'm inclined to take it).

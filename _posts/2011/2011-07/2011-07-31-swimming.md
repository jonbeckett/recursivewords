Just got back from taking the kids swimming, and probably drew raised eyebrows from other parents in the poolafter the first ten minutes we pulled all of our kids out of the children's pool, and put them in the adult pool (suitably kitted out with floats).

We learned one really important thing when we put our eldest through those swimming lessons that contributed to wiping the bank account outkids learn to swim much more quickly when they can't touch the bottom.

And so it was proven this afternoon.

Memorable moment of the dayshowing our eldest that I really can swim (because you never really get to swim when you're with small children in the pool). I did about half a length front-crawl to show her how she should be breathing, and she was goggle eyed "you're so fast!"In other news, we are thinking of changing our youngest's last name to Phelps.

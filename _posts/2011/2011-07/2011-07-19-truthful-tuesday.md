I just wandered into Tumblr, and lost myself for a few minutes reading "Truthful Tuesday" posts. While Tumblr has numerous failures and annoyances (more than I can sensibly list here) something occurred to me -I miss the people I left behind.

Every time I wander back into Tumblr I remember the friendships that were forged, the fun times, the laughter, the candid posts, and the shared confidences. I remember walls coming down, people opening up, reaching out, and embracing one another.

A lot of the people I once followed left long ago. A few remain. I go back from time to time and wonder if they remember meif they remember the laughter, the fun times. Each time I return it becomes more difficult to walk away again, and yet I do.

I believe J M Barrie would say I am brave for doing so.

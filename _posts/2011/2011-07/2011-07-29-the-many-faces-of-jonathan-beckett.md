I've been struggling to think of anything to write recently. I've also been struggling to keep up with what others are writing or rather, not reading what they have written at all.

Something occurred to me today though, after reading a similar train of thought from a far flung friend.

We are here of our own volition, not through the expectation of others. The amount we share, and the amount we consume are our own choice. It is also up to each of us to apply somecommon sense in both regards.

If I gathered the combined output of everybody I follow on Google+, Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, Blogger and WordPress, it would take me a week to read and comment on each day's worth of posts. In the past I have felt guilty about "not keeping up"not good.

While trying to get comfortable with the idea of "not caring so much" (which in itself is a struggle, because it goes against "who I am"), I started thinking about the various networks I am a member of, and how I use themor rather, how I should use them.

This is really just a brain dump for me, but feel free to agree, disagree, like, dislike, comment, shout, or whatever it is you do if you happen to read this; Google+In it's early days, Google+ has cemented itself as a place I can hang out with bloggers, techies, journalists, and friends to chat in the same way we might have in IRC or forums years ago. It's brilliant, and is only getting better as more people arrive. TwitterI don't see myself using Twitter much going forward (not that I ever did). I somehow have a huge following, and used to feel guilty about not posting more oftenbut the truth seems to be that Twitter is full of people shouting, and very few people listening. Not exactly much use. FacebookI hardly ever post to Facebook any more, but I do keep track of family and friends therepurely because they all use it. It took years for them all to begin using it, and I don't see that changing any time soon. Contrary to all the hate stories you read, I don't mind Facebook that much. I do mind the stalking and attention seeking that goes on from old school friends though. Blogger / WordPressLong time readers will know that I switched camps from WordPress to Blogger recently. I see the blog as being a personal/public journal, and always have done. It's the place I'll dump my thoughts about things going on in my life (or at least the thoughts fit for public consumption), and will some day serve our children as a record of who their Dad really waswhat he thought about, and what he cared about. Over the years the blog has lead to some of the closest friendships I've ever had. TumblrI struggle with Tumblr. It's neither the best, or worst platform out there, but it is popular which means a lot of people use it, and that's the real value I get from itthe people. I've made some incredible friends while pitching content into Tumblr, and sharing with the community. I've recently created an account there after not being a member for a while, purely to follow those I left behind. I guess that says something about me as a person. EmailWriting emails to people appeals to the eccentric or romantic part of me. There's something about a messageeven if it's only a few wordsthat has more meaning than a public post to a social network, or blog. I love receiving word from far flung friends, and writing to them. Always have. Always will.

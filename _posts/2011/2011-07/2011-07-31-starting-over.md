In recent weeks my presence here has been deleted, reinstated, recreated, and finally reinvented. I think in some ways I had to walk away in order to realise what I would miss.

I missed the friends I had made most of allor rather the opportunity to like their posts, to laugh with them, to support them when down, and to just be there.

I missed a place I can dump thoughts. Perhaps more private thoughts than I share on the blog, or the social networks. Thoughts I'm not so comfortable with real world friends or family reading.

While not striving for any kind of anonymity, I am driving a wedge between this and any other online activities. This is a special place. It's an escape in many ways from everywhere else.

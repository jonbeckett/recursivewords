It was fun while it lasted, but there are just too many things that don't quite work right (which was expected, to be honestit's a development build of an operating system that's supposed to only work on approved hardwarethe rather lovely Google Chromebook machines).

I can begrudgingly live with Windows 7. There are upsides to it; the netbook was designed with it in mindtherefore it has all the correct drivers to make the hardware work you know properly.

If I had any kind of expendable income (which I don't), I would have already bought a Samsung Chromebook. They boot from cold in 7 seconds They last 10 hours on a charge I'll shut up, because I'll just get more annoyed.

I guess I could put Chromium OS on a USB stick.

Or not.

Note to self: stop fiddling with all this crap.

The guy in front of me for the cashpoint in the bank was stood, feet apart, dancing around like his balls were on fire. He was not listening to any music, and there was no music on in the store. He was just waiting for the machine to spit his cash and card back at him.

He turned around in a dance move, realised I was stood behind him, and went back into 40-something suburban Dad mode.

Idiot.

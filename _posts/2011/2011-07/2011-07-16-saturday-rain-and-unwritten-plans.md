It's Saturday morning, and it's raining cats and dogs. Great big ones. Ones that go woof (well, not the cats obviously). We are busy revising what on earth we had planned to do today - not much if truth be told, but whatever ideas had been planned to throw at me, they just got screwed up and thrown in the dustbin.

Much of my life revolves around doing things for other people that they had presumed I would do without telling me.

Yesterday morning I found out at 7am that I had booked the wrong half a day off work - meaning I missed Little Miss 6 and Little Miss 7's sports day at school.

"You can go and see the dance show at the big school this afternoon instead then - doors open at quarter to two."

I agreed, left work a little after lunchtime (after fighting several fires in order to have even a few hours off), and arrived at the prescribed place, at the prescribed time. I bumped into several other school Mums who thought it tremendously funny that I had no idea what I had come to see, or even which of my children was in it. I readily admitted that until breakfast time that morning, I had no clue that the event even existed.

I somehow made it into the theater with no ticket, got seperated from everybody I know, and sat cramped into a corner next to several other parents who had no concept of personal space for the next hour. Thankfully the kids dancing show was brilliant, and took my mind completely off being kicked, elbowed, and talked past.

Anyway. Back to today. I believe next in my itinerary for today is a trip to buy food for dinner this evening - apparently we're inviting the young girls over that live opposite to have dinner with ours. I have to buy party food...

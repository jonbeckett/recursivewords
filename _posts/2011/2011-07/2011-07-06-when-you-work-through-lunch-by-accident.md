After meddling with some code that was "nearly finished" for "another five minutes", I just looked up and realised I worked straight through lunch. I do that a lot.

My favourite trick is forgetting to eat. It doesn't happen so much any more, because I stopped doing freelance work. I would regularly get in from work, sit at the computer, and just carry straight on. Those antics came to mind this morning, when somebody (somebody famous!) was pointed in my direction to get some web development done. I immediately turned the opportunity down.

Since stopping the freelance work, my evenings have become my own once more. I am taking part in the internet, rather than spending all my time helping others take part in it. I'm forging new friendships, making connections, and having fun. On any given evening I find myself checking in at Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, and recently Google+ (which is spectacular, and launching soon!). I also try to make my way to friends blogs, read, comment, and shoot the breeze with them.

Just recently I have also been dipping a toe into "instant messaging" - either through Google Talk, or KIK - the only downer being that I invariably forget to touch base with people before the early hours of the morning - so I end up sat in bed until 1am feeding conversations around the globe.

The problem is you're all too interesting. I need you all to be a bit more boring. Can you do that?

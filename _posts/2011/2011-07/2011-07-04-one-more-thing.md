When I left the house to take the kids to the playpark yesterday morning, I spent my first few minutes in the park picking up the remains of an entire case of beer bottles, and an entire case of beer cans, that were littered around the park, and the children's playground.

It took me minutesto put it all in the empty bin at the playpark.

Without getting into the argument about drinking in the park in the first place (a situation caused because the older generation in town have made sure their are no amenities for younger people), how much effort did it take all of whoever was out thereto clear up after themselves? I did it single-handed inside two or three minutes...

Laziness really annoys the crap out of me.

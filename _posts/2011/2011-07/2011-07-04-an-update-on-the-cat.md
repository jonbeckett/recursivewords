For those who don't know, one of our cats was hit by a car last week. He was discovered by a neighbour, hiding in a bush about 50 yards from our house, calling out. They took him to the vet, and told us when we arrived home.

We took him to the hospital on Thursday night, and left him there to be checked properly the next morning. I was pretty annoyed with the vet actually - their first conversation was about money, rather than the cat. Luckily the cat is insured for this kind of thing, but I still thought it was awful.

On Friday morning we got word through that he's broken his left femur, and pelvis. After another day, they decided he had no other internal injuries, although he might have some nerve damage in his left leg. He could therefore be operated on in the early part of next (this) week.

If everything has happened as planned, he's already been operated on while I'm writing this, and had his various broken bones pinned or wired back together again - and will be looking forward to several weeks living in a cage...

I wonder how many of his nine lives this has used up ?

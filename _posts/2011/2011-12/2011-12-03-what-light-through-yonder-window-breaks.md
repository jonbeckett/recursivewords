How is it December already? I only realised it was december when I looked at my watch just now, and it's already saying it's the 3rd? Have I really been that much out of the loop? I guess I haveEntering the final afternoon of development work in preparation for a week away, I received word that the week away is now three days away, and I will not be travelling until Wednesday next week. Great. While I'm happy that I'm not away for too long, it doesn't change the fact that all our plans are already cancelled for the week ahead.

I seem to live and die by the word of others at the moment, and I don't like it very much at all.

I need coffee.(5 minutes pass while I make coffeealthough it's only decaf, because we ran out of the real stuff a couple of weeks ago, and then while waiting for the kettle to boil I clear the kitchen up, and tidy the lounge a little)So. Against all expectation the weekend is my own. I believe we have another school bazaar to visit tomorrow, followed by a trip to the cinema, and then dinner at TGI Fridays (American themed diner a few miles away). They children love TGI's because it's loud, fun, and the food is great.

Sunday will most probably be filled with cleaning the house in preparation for Christmas decorations going up.

This weekend already seems a little strangeafter a while you get into the rhythm of working every evening. When you don't have to work any more, you wonder what to do with yourself.

Yes, the title of this blog post is a blatant rip-off of "Tuesday Night Music Club" (the Sheryl Crow album that catapulted her to MTV fame, and bedroom walls the world over).

My club probably differs a bit from hers though; it involves staying in the Holiday Inn, a hundred miles from home, eating dinner with colleagues, and trying to stay out of the hotel bar.

For the first time in recent memory, today was a good day. Things worked. Really complicated, clever, technical things worked. They don't usually do that. People went "ooooh", and "aaaaah". People smiled. I like it when people smileespecially when they've paid the company I work for thousands of pounds for me to make something complicated and clever for them.

I just called home, and talked to our six year old. It was her Nativity play tonight, and I was one of the few parents in our circle of friends absent. She had her first speaking part, and apparently caused more than a few tears from a proud Mum I get to see it on Wednesday night.

I guess I should wander down to the bar to find my colleagues soon. Figure out what we are going to do for dinner. There's some kind of offer on in the hoteltwo courses and two drinks for the price of a small car, or something like that. We shall see

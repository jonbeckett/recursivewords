After a marathon three days living in a far flung hotel, wrestling with huge complexity all day, and feverishly working into the early hours each night, I finally returned home last night for the weekend.

Waking up this morning to the sound of children floating through the house drew a huge smile. While gazing at the ceiling, contemplating getting up, I listened to pirate battles, board games, the rattle of lego, and all manner of improvised rules being dictated.

My big problem this weekend is "switching off". I will be leaving again at 7am on Monday morning (missing our youngest's nativity play in the process), and will return again in the days leading up to Christmas.

While travelling home last night I become lost in thoughtrecalling countless movies scenes such as the one in "Hook" where Robin Williams is pulled up by his wife for missing his children's childhood. Compared to many people I'm very luckyit's rare that I am called on to work remotelyit's just bad luck that when it does happen, it invariably causes chaos at home.

The challenge this weekend therefore is to switch offto forget everything about work, and concentrate on my family, and perhaps even find a few moments for myself.

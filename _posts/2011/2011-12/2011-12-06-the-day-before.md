Tomorrow morning I'll be out of the house before daylight, destined for several days in far flung faceless offices, endless meetings, gnashing of teeth, drumming of fingers, wracking of brains, and finally the company of my colleagues for dinner, and a lonely hotel room at the Holiday Inn each night. I'm writing this in my lunch break at work, because there's hardly any chance I will be able to do so this evening. If you need some idea, I was washing up at 7:30 this morning, and put all of my fleeces in the washing machine before leaving for work. This is normal for a house with 4 women in it as far as I have seenif you want clean clothes, you have to pretty much wash them yourself, the day before you need them.

Note to selfmust stop on the way home tonight to buy more wash kit. I did my famous trick last time and left a brand new bottle of shampoo in the hotel shower. It's one of my key skillsit should be on my resum.

Sat here at lunchtime, tools downed, listening to a barrage of electronica in my ears and wondering how best to waste the next half an hour. There are probably better things to be doing than emptying my head into a text editor, but at the moment I can't think of them, and can't be bothered to try. It's been one of those days so far " when you run so fast and for so long, that you forget why you're running, or where you're supposed to be going. You're just running. I feel like I need a day off " and yet I know if I take one, all manner of crap at home will land on me to pretty much obviate it which means I keep turning up, keep turning the pedals, keep running. I guess it keeps a roof over our heads.

It's Monday morning, and everything seems to be right with the world for a change. No doubt some kind of express train from hell will burst out of nowhere soon and revise everything, but for the moment " everything is good. I got a lot of things done this weekend " tidied the garden up, tidied my wreck of an online life up, washed up any number of times, took the kids to the big playpark in town, bought nice food, and even survived a trip into town in good spirits where I arrived at a cashpoint, and discovered we had no money left sigh. Before anybody starts sending red cross parcels to us, we are fine " really. I could explain how we budget at home (on purspose), but it would only make interesting reading for accountants and credit card salespeople. p.s. if this is your first visit to the new blog, hello!

I'm sat watching the movie "Zathura" with our youngest. Her eldest sister is grounded " considering her actions of the past few days in her room. I delivered dinner to her room, and had to force the door open " she had barricaded herself in. Middle sister is at Brownies with my her mum. She left dressed in a polka-dot ra-ra skirt, carrying tinsel cheerleading pom-poms something to do with the Eurovision Song Contest apparently. So far I've eaten a pizza, and shared a box of microwave popcorn with Little Miss 6. She ate enough to sink a large ship, then turned to me and told me she was still hungry. All things considered, a pretty normal evening (for a given value of "normal").

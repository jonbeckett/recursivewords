I'm sat bathed in the light of several laptops and flat screens. Source code is scrolling past, along with compilation results, and various debug traces. The Tron Legacy soundtrack is pumping into my heads, my fingers seem to be typing what I tell them for a change, and things are making sense. This pretty rare. Now and again the silent signal "Build Succeeded" flashes up in the status bar of Visual Studio, and tells me that today I am on it. This is even more rare. Here's a secret. I know I'm a damn good developer. I never mention it to anybody, because it would make me seem aloof, and arrogant. I would rather help others improve their code than criticise it. I do get annoyed when forced to pick up others work though " and untangle the mess they have made. I never talk about what I do, do I perhaps it's time I did.

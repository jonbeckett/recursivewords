I've just been reading various news stories about the "end of the world", which apparently occurs tomorrow. This is all according to a number of self important people who are taking the words of the precious little books they rely on to run their lives as literally and perversely as possible. Let me get this right? They're trusting the numbers in their little book to calculate through several thousand years of dates? A few thoughts; Which faith's version of the book are they using? Which re-write are they using? How are they figuring out the start date for their calculation, given that both the gregorian calendar, and our system of numeracy are relatively new ? Have they taken into account that there should not have been a leap year in 2000 ? (go read about it " every 400 years, there should be no leap year on a year ending "00" because they knew a very long time ago about the precession of the earth's axis). I think a far more useful book in predicting the end of the world would be "The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy" by Douglas Adams " for a number of reasons; There's only one version of it It was written by one person Lots of people think it's great Following the various signals he describes in the book that might foretell the end of the world, I'll take heed, and watch a few webcams of the coastline. If the Dolphins start to leave en-masse, we know we're in trouble.

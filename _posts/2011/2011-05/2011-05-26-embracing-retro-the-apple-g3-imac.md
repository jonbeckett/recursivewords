Yesterday evening a large box awaited me in our study, containing a piece of computing historyan Apple iMac. It's a little over ten years old, and in it's day was a formidable piece of computing kit. For the greater part of it's history it appears to have sat unused in a school somewhere, and ended up being sold on through EBay. Chance brought it to us, to live out it's days being used by our children to write stories, to email their grandparents, to do homework, and to learn.

Little Miss Seven jumped up and down, clapping her hands when I hit the power button for the first time, and the "Apple Chime" sounded through the speakers."It sounds like Wall-E!"

Today feels strange. After a weekend where I was afforded the rare luxury (essentially through being housebound) of following my own interests " my own agenda, it's odd to be back in the office. I find myself switching from a world of books, writing, and friends to one of computers, source code, and software development. After being so immersed in new friendships, conversations, thoughts, and ideas, meeting the cold hard logic of a terminal prompt, or a compiler is something of a shock. I've never felt this before. It's unsettling.

[youtube=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsC3g3N_qUQ&w=425&h=349]In late 2009 I spent the best part of three months living in a variety of hotels in central Englandalthough chiefly in the Hilton, all expenses paid by a commercial contract.

I set out on the journey with whimsical ideas about what hotel life would be like; that we would learn the names of the bar staff, and they would come to know us too. A bizarre home from home.

The truth was of course very differenta soulless existence of early morning breakfasts, days spent staring at computer screens in faceless office buildings, and evenings spent continuing on with the work from hilariously faulty rooms.

Ever since that time, the Elton John track "Holiday Inn" from the "Madman Across the Water" album has held a special significance. I related to the subtext far more closely than most because I've been there.

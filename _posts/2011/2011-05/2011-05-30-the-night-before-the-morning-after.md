I'm headed back into London tomorrow morning with work (while I say "tomorrow", it's nearing 1am " so it's really "later today"). I'm tempted to get the early train, just to make sure the journey has plenty of time built-in for a coffee en-route. I kind of like watching London wake up on a morning. It does mean getting up really early though, which isn't quite as much fun I think I'm pretty much ready, anyway; Suit trousers and shirt are hanging up downstairs Work laptop, charger, and hard drive are in my backpack Netbook is charging next to bed, as is mobile phone MP3 player is full of latest episodes of podcasts Moleskine is in the backpack I'm tempted not to take the Kindle with me " it's probably a target for thieves on trains, and if my last journey in is anything to go by, I won't get a seat on the train into London anyway. I had forgotten about the preparation routine for working in London. When I did the secondment a couple of years ago I was used to it " used to the 4 hours on the train each day, and the clothes routine (I always got dressed and undressed in the study, downstairs " to avoid waking everybody up when I got up). Anyway it's nearly 1am. I have to be up in 4 and a half hours

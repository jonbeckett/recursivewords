The G3 Mac arrived this evening. I unwrapped it, put it on the desk, plugged it in, and powered it up. The front light came on, then nothing else. I sat wondering if it was quietly loading the BIOS or something, when there was huge bang, and smoke began pouring from it.

Dead as a doornail.

I'm guessing Parcelforce (the delivery company) are to blame.

Annoyed is not the word.

Back in the office this morning after the adventure in London yesterday. Lots to think about " ideas for the future, and long term plans being thrown around. Not much more I can share on a public form (there's the downside of being a "professional developer", right there). A few minutes to spare before a meeting to organise my work next week " hence this mad rush to write something this morning, because I'm not sure I'll get another chance today. In other news, late last night I rolled a theme across the "real me" homepage at jonbeckett.com, in preparation to shove some of my past freelance projects in as portfolio posts. I have had a steady stream of people asking if I will help them build their websites, and after batting some of them away to the community (who showed no interest what so ever), it looks like I will be carrying on with some semblance of freelance work after all " although I might not charge for it. We shall see It goes without saying " if you have a web project you've been tinkering with and have got stuck, give me a shout.

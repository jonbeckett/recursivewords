I swear, I can hear the gears of the universe crunching as Friday refuses to quit on me. Not funny. If this was all invented by a creator (Flying Spaghetti Monster or Big White Beardy Dude " doesn't really matter), I don't appreciate the apparent vendetta they have trained towards me. Just to make things worse as I grow more tired, the sun has now come out, and is slowly baking the building. I guess should rotate slowly in my chair to ensure I'm cooked evenly?

In the far distant past, I used to read a lot of blogs. This was back in the days before social networks, microblogs, tumblogs, or whatever else has been invented in the last decade. Blogging was where it was at in terms of publishing an online journal.

The advent of RSS and "Feed Aggregators" such as Google Reader and NetVibes made it a lot easier to follow lots of people; their writing was brought to you each day instead of you having to trudge around the various links in your favourites.

I still use Google Reader almost every day " but will admit in the last few months I have not been using it to catch up with old friends who write blogs. I had followed too many people, and even the task of whittling down the list seemed like hard work. What I needed was a lunchtime at work with nothing better to do, and that's exactly what just happened.

If you look up in the list of pages in the blog (if you're looking at the blog, and not an aggregator, or dashboard, or whatever), I have put my "blogroll" back together. While compiling the list, I found myself looking at old friends, and smiling broadly. I also kicked myself " realising that so many of them had carried on writing regularly, and I had been missing out.

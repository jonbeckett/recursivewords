A new friend on the interwebs just pointed me in the direction of KIK " a fantastic messenger app for iOS and Android that looks and works pretty much the same as Blackberry Messenger. It does the whole "received / read" indicator thing on each message " which neither Google Talk, Yahoo Instant Messenger, or Windows Live Messenger do. Seriously though " how come I had never installed KIK and had a play with it? I'm jonbeckett on KIK if you have it on your phone. I foresee lots of new friends, and no work (or sleep) getting done for a few days at least until the novelty wears off, anyway.

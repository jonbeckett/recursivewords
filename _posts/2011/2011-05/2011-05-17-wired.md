After a day spent submerged in swathes of C#, Javascript, class libraries, web services, HTML, SQL, CAML, and various other dialects of computer language known only to people as idiotic as myself, I am having trouble "switching off". It's 10:30pm at the time of writing, and I'm still buzzing. Typing speed is off the scale at the moment (perhaps I should head off to 750words.com and get some kind of measure on the words flying from my fingers). For those wondering what I use to write, this is happening in a fantastic full-screen editor for Linux called "PyRoom". Imagine a completely black screen, with a flashing green cursor and that's all. No windows, no toolbars, no scrollbars, no buttons just the cursor, and the text. There is a similar editor available for Windows called WriteMonkey (which supports markdown renditioning to HTML and RTF too!). Damn coffee has gone cold. It probably doesn't help that I have acquired the soundtrack album from the movie "Hackers", which turns out to be fantastic for the state of mind I find myself in. It probably beats the Tron Legacy soundtrack as background music while programming. Not sure it beats the mighty "Ocean Eyes" by Owl City. It's blaring into my ears right now via a pair of Sennheizer headphones. Coffee I need coffee off to put the kettle on

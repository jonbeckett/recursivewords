I read a great post on Tumblr early this morning about the willingness to carry on " to keep putting one foot in front of the other. It struck all kinds of chords in my head, and has obviously been turning silent cogs somewhere, because I'm now writing this Over the last few years I have found it increasingly difficult to write about daily life. The level of self censorship going on from my side is such that I now doubt I am sharing anything worthwhile. Conjuring interesting subjects that will not offend anybody in my circle of family and friends reduces the worth to a point where I question the effort involved. A voice on one shoulder tells me that I should not care so much about the thoughts of others; that my voice is valid, and the actions or opinions I express should stand up to scrutiny " regardless of the guilt they might illicit in others. An opposing voice tells me that invariably the spoken words or acts I might describe in telling the story of a day were not shared with the public in the same way my published thoughts are. I find myself questioning if I can really be bothered with dealing with the avoidance of the slings and arrows. Is it better to confront it? To let the detractors waste their time, and continue on " tilting at whichever windmills inspire me each day? It's a balancing act, isn't it " choosing when a subject should be confined to your head, a private message or email, or opened up for the world to share.

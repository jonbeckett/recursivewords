I'm returning to London tomorrow morning for the first time in a while. I've been invited to the launch of a new product by one of our technical partners " an early chance to see something shiny and clever. The fact that it basically means a day off work is a huge win. The additional fact that it means getting up at 6am not so much of a win really. The launch is taking place in one of the big Microsoft buildings " I guess this means I should boot the netbook into Windows, and not Ubuntu to take notes during the briefing. Sitting in the middle of Mordor running Linux would be pretty damn funny though (and actually far more useful, in terms of the software it has for note taking). If the weather's good I'm hoping to take lots of photos on the return journey " a "slice of life" in one of the world's great cities.

I got accused of being one of the "tumblr people" this morning, after being complimentary about a friend's photo. My immediate reaction surprised myself; "but but I'm not one of the tumblr people" "what do you mean?" "I'm a blogger, hiding out at tumblr" "you're going to have to explain that one" I had to think about it. Lots. Why do I not really consider myself one of the "tumblr people"? Perhaps the whole thing has crept up on me, embraced me, and I'm now a tumblr person who happens to blog? After thinking about it a lot, and then a bit more (in the same way that Winnie the Pooh might have done " I really am that stupid sometimes), I thought perhaps the best way to explain the difference between a blogger, and a tumblrer might be via a list. Everybody loves lists right? Let's imagine what people might post to a blog, versus a tumblog; Good Posts for a Blog A day in the life Thoughts on story in the news A capsule review of a new gadget Discussion of an idea you've had Photos and story of a day out Good Posts for a Tumblog Photo of this morning's breakfast Rant about driver who cut you up Quote from movie you were just talking about Photo of yourself grinning at your mobile phone List of answers to random questions for a meme that's doing the rounds This is where I get accused of being an idiot, and unfollowed en-masse, isn't it. Except I am allowed to make incendiary posts like this because I have a blog, and a tumblr account

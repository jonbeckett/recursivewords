After another day spent almost exclusively with the children, we ended it by choosing a movie to watch together after dinner. Spiderman won the day, after a debate about the age advisory on it (it's a "12"), and how much our eldest might play on that to avoid going to bed.She did get play on it, but gave in after my better half threatened all manner of draconian sanctions to last throughout half-term. Our kids have still not realised we hold all the trump cards in just about every stand-off.

Halfway through Spiderman, I vanished off to the kitchen in search of ice cream. Given our youngest doesn't like ice cream (_yes, you read that right_), I started scratching my head. Meatballs. We have the only little girl in the world who will choose meatballs over ice cream.p.s. we're out of wine. It's a disaster. We'll have to resort to tea drinking or something

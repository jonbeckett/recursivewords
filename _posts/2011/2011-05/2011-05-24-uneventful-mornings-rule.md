The day started at 7 with the eruption of rubbish radio from the alarm clock, and the sound of little people creating as much noise as possible across the landing. I cracked one eye open, in W's direction, and caught her grinning at the girl's audible antics. "Make me a cup of tea, and I'll get them up". On my way past their rooms, I wandered in anyway, and barked sargeant major instructions to get up, get dressed, get washed, and get downstairs " ripping the curtains open as I did so. "I'm poorly" "No you're not. Get up." "But I'm poorly" I ignored the rest of the argument, and walked off. The next time I saw her, she was stood in the bathroom brushing her teeth. Go figure. Three cats appeared from nowhere to accompany me every step of the way towards the kitchen, gliding to a halt near their food bag. If they could have pointed at their mouth, they would have (in reality, they wait for a few moments before standing on their back legs, and sinking front claws into me while I make lunches). The rest of the day so far? Cycled to work against the wind, almost losing the will to live in the process. Listened to "This Week in Tech" en-route, and since then have been hunched over my desk, fighting battles with programming once again. I looked up at 12:30, thinking it might be 11am. It's been that kind of morning. Roll on the weekend. Again.

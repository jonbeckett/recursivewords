For the first time in recent memory, I have a pretty clear recollection of a dream so am recording it for prosterity. This is probably going to serve as a warning to you all " the internal workings of my brain make no sense. As usual, the dream was a series of bizarrely connected and disconnected scenes. Found myself arriving at a restaurant in an old railcar in the depths of an industrial estate where a co-worker was asking me to pay part of the cost of a meal. Apparently the restaurant was the new "hip" place to go for dinner, and cost a fortune. I have no idea why I was paying. The co-worker ran out of money while paying for his and his other half's meal, and then expected me to pay the rest. I kept handing over notes from my wallet until I had no money left " while he crossed out various things on the menu that he had asked for. While doing this a snotty waiter looked down his nose at him. While waiting around, feeling bitter, I bumped into lots of people I knew in the rail car "waiting area" (apparently all restaurant rail cars have an entire lounge the size of a normal bar " that must work something like a Tardis). While talking to one of the managers from work (who was of course also there with his wife), I suddenly noticed I couldn't open my right eye. This was the moment I woke up, and realised my right eye was jammed against the pillow which was why it wouldn't open. Figure that dream out.

I'm not sure what was going on with the traffic today. I left the house 10 minutes later than normal, and was nearly hit by 4 different cars within 200 yards of our house. Everybody had a case of the Fridays except mewho was busy dodging the Friday brigade like a cat on hot coals (or an unshaved web designer on a mountain bike).

I digress.

After working flat out all day, and doing the usual mental gymnastics and wrestling marathon with mountains of source code (trying to gently persuade it all to behave in the manner I dreamed up rather than the error strewn mess it tried to adopt), I eventually turfed myself out of the building at about 6, and walked out into the cold night air, fished my bike from the side of the building, turned it's lights on, and began the cycle home.

I walked in the back door and found W crying.

Suddenly my stresses vanished as I asked what on earth was wrong. It turned out our eldest daughter had a huge tantrum over her maths homework, and trying to juggle too many plates (making dinner, wrangling the younger children, and dealing with Miss "I can't do maths") tipped Wend over the edge.

For a while I went into what can only be described as "bad cop" modepouring ice water in all directions, and making it known to the children that I was not happy, things were going to be taken away, people grounded, and future events cancelled.

Perversely this caused W to turn on me toobecause no doubt she would have to deal with the repurcussions of groundings, bans, and confiscations. She was right. What the hell were we going to do?I had a stroke of genius.

As we all sat at the dinner table for dinner, I stopped all the children in their tracks."Right. Everybody. You need to listen to this. We're going to do something we have never done before. We're going to pretend the last couple of hours have not happened, and that we've all just walked in the door.

Me and Mum work really hard all week, and we're both really tired. The last thing we need to deal with at the end of the week is you claiming you don't know how to do your homework, fighting over Mario Party, stealing each other's colouring pens, or anything else.

We're just really, really tired, and we need you to help us. Do you all agree? Will you all try really hard to help each other a little bit more? To not complain when things don't go your way? To think about everybody else a bit more?"Three little girls (who were now looking down at the table in front of them) nodded quietly.

And you know what? It worked.

After the last of the children went to bed this evening, I turned to W and said "Do I get some sort of prize?"She smiled."Thankyou"

A little while earlier this evening I posted a recommendation for the book I've been reading to our children on Facebookit's called "You're a Bad Man, Mr Gum", by Andy Stanton. One of my friends added it to their "to read" list at GoodReads, and posted that to Facebook too.

In all honesty, I had forgotten all about GoodReadsit's a wonderful social network built around the love of books, and readingand it somehow imparts the want "to read" back into you. Reading other people's comments about books becomes infectious.

Anywaywhile reading the comments others had written about "You're a Bad Man, Mr Gum", I logged in and recorded that I had read it toothen stumbled upon my own "to read" listcompiled a couple of years ago when I was commuting into and out of London each day. I had 4 hours to myself each day, so played games, wrote in my notebook, and perhaps most importantly I read books.

Here are the first ten from the listit's worth pointing out that GoodReads sorts them by average rating by defaultTo Kill a Mockingbird, by Harper LeeThe Catcher in the Rye, by J D SalingerThe Great Gatsby, by F. Scott FitzgeraldOf Mice and Men, by John SteinbeckSlaughterhouse Five, by Kurt VonnegutThe Alchemist, by Paulo CoelhoLord of the Flies, by William GoldingThe Odyssey, by HomerA Tale of Two Cities, by Charles DickensFrankenstein, by Mary ShelleyI think we have about half of the books knocking around the houseand I'm sure I can find the others in download collections for the Kindle. The big thing is time though. In order to give myself the reading bug again, I need to step away from the internet.

Stepping away from computers and the internet is more difficult than it might once have beenthese days it equates to walking away from your friends.

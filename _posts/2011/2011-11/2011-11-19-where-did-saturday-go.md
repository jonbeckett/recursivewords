Between the time I rolled out of bed this morning, and it getting dark this evening, the day has been unrelenting. We've somehow packed in;Football Practice This usually means cycling down to the football pitch with our eldest, freezing your nuts off for a couple of hours, and then cycling home again. This morning it turned into "drop her off in the car while Dad makes packed lunches for the next thing on the list, then pick her up again an hour later (at half time) to race off to the next thing.

Contact with Siblings Every six months our children meet up with their siblings (they are all adopted or in foster care)today was that day, so we visited the local petting farm as a "meeting place". Today was the first time a social worker has not been present at the meeting, and it went really well.

Re-wired the Router Our wireless internet connection has been hilariously rubbish for ageswhen we got home this evening I set about ripping the wiring out and moving the router to a more central point in the house. With a bit of luck it will solve everything (if it doesn't I'll be at a loss of what to try nextother than buying a business class wireless modem).

Despatching Dead Doves in the Dark After re-wiring half the house, it was dark so I wandered into the garden to shut the chickens in. Stepping out of the back door I almost stood in the mangled remains of a dove that the cats had ambushed. Ew. It's now in the recycling bin at the front of the house, along with most of the feathers I found.

Cleaning Chickens Out When I finally got to the chickens I discovered them still outside in the dark. Strange. Out of curiosity I opened the back of the chicken run, and discovered that nobody had been checking for eggs for over a week or cleaned them out. I filled a halloween bucket with the eggs, and gave them fresh new straw to snuggle down in.

So. There went Saturday. This morning the washing machine decided to die too, so we're all in "only change clothes if you absolutely have to" mode. We're praying we don't have to replace the washing machine right before ChristmasFingers crossed I get to have a quiet/lazy Sunday (it won't happen, but the hope is always there).

It's only tuesday evening, and I feel like I've been run over by a truck.

I worked until 2am in my hotel room on a client project for work, and was back up at 7 this morning for breakfast, and an early check-out from the hotel. After sprinting all morning to get a newer version of the code ready for a demo this afternoon I didn't make it and had to go back to an earlier versionwhich (rather predictably) fell over in the demo the first time it has fallen over in front of an audience.

After a two hour journey home, I have worked all eveningit's now heading towards midnightand am still not finished. The rest of the week is going to be more of the same.

I realised earlier that the project was planned without asking anybody how long it might take to build the solution, and of course I'm not happy putting out any old rubbish, so am slowly killing myself to make something I would be happy giving to anybody else.

Caring about what you do, and what other people think about what you do sucks sometimes.

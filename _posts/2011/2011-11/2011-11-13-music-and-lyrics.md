After yet another crazy Saturday, I suggested after we got the children to bed that we just sit and watch a moviesomething that might not require too much effort to watch, that we hadn't seen for a while. After perusing the few hundred DVDs we have accumulated over the years, I somehow settled on "Music and Lyrics".

While watching the movie, the thought kept crossing my mind about it being a "romantic comedy", and how some people fit that into a certain demographic. Thankfully I've never been one for convention, or conforming to stereotypesso sat and enjoyed it (again) hugely. I guess with "Music and Lyrics" it helps that I can remember the era that it parodies so wellI can remember buying records from bands with crazy hair, signature dance moves, and idiotically shot videos.

I'll freely admit to a tear running down my cheek when Hugh Grant plays the solo at the end, and entirely predictably tears down the walls Drew Barrymore was busy building.

I'm not sure why movies like this deconstruct me so successfully. I think maybe it's a "getting older" thingwhen we are young we experience movies in the first personour hopes and dreams are wrapped up around the experience happening to the characters. As we grow older, we start to experience movies in the third personhaving been in similar situations, our empathy draws us in, and becomes the chief culprit in undoing us from time to time.

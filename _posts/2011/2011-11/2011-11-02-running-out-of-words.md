I've been sat here in the hotel for the last hour in front of the laptop, staring into space, reading junk on the internet, and basically wasting time. When I first sat down I planned on writing somethingin the blogI just had no idea what.

No idea presented itself. So I just sat, daydreamed, and did nothing.

Sometimes I wonder about stopping the blog. The goal (at least since having children) has always been to record something of myself for themso they and future generations can look back and know me better than I knew my grandparents.

It's difficult. Sometimes it feels like keeping going with recording random chunks of my life is pointlessand other times if feels like stopping would somehow be depriving future readers in some way.

Maybe I think too much.

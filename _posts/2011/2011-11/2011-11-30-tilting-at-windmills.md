I have been working past midnight, day after day to single handedly wrench the project I am working on from a "conceptual demo" to an "installable product" for the last couple of weeks. It's been a long, hard struggle, and meant working late into the night, night after night. The most recent milestone to reach was an "all up" demo starting in 40 minutes time. The demo just got cancelled.

I have never felt more like Don Quixote in my life.

This is itmy entirewash bag contents, after a trip to the shops to replenish everything this morningToothbrushes I have an electric toothbrush somewhere, but am always forgetting to charge it. I love the feel of a new toothbrush. I don't buy the idiotic battery powered ones because they are just thatidiotic.Toothpaste I buy Colgate out of habit. As long as it makes my breath taste nice, I don't really mind which toothpaste I use.

Combined Shampoo / Conditioner I have short hair. On purpose. Therefore I tend to buy the cheapest (within reason) shampoo I can find, and usually go for the one with conditioner built in. Back when I had long hair, I used to buy better stuff, but it's just not worth it at the moment.Razor and Gel I've been pretty loyal to the "King of Shaves" stuff ever since Will King (owner of the company)saw my blog post about it back in the day, and wrote me a fantastic email. It's still the only shaving stuff I can reliably use without cutting my face to pieces. Major revelation using their stuff is that oil works better than shaving gel or foamDeodorant I just pick whatever big brand happens to be selling. This tactic means sometimes I smell great, and sometimes I smell like a chemistry experiment gone wrong. I guess some girls must like the smell of chemistry experiments, or they wouldn't sell it.

It just occurred to me I forgot to buy shower gel (that sound is my palm hitting my own forehead).

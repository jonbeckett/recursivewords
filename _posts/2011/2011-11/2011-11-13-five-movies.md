In response to my last post, I was asked if I could come up with a list of films that I likethat inspire me. For the last hour or so I've sat here, trying to come up with some movies that didn't do so well at the box office, and have somehow been forgotten.

I guess the common theme throughout is "escapism". They are all movies that take you on a journey, and will stay with you in the future.

Finding ForresterThe story of a gifted young writer from a deprived background who makes a chance friendship with a reclusive author (the parallels with J D Salinger are obvious). It's an incredible movie, and makes you want to go out and buy a mechanical typewriter.[youtube=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Hd6CZG-Vos&w=560&h=315]Big FishThe story of a son visiting his dying father, who he only really knew through the stories he toldstories which always seemed just a little far fetched. Or were they?[youtube=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d-kjzBmz6I&w=560&h=315]Mr Holland's OpusI think the quote from the lead character sums this movie up; "I got dragged into this gig kicking and screaming, and now it's all I ever want to do". By turns heart warming, gut wrenching, and thought provoking.[youtube=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tQJBBY7X6I&w=420&h=315]Little ChildrenSome movies suck you in, disturb you, tug away at your loose ends, and leave you unsettled. This is one of those movies, and it's brilliant. Kate Winslet runs away with the entire movie. She should have won the oscar.[youtube=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiJLJd7cH1c&w=560&h=315]L'Homme du TrainThe wonderful story of two men wishing they had each other's livesone a wealthy bachelor, the other a career criminal. As unlikely as the premise is, they suck you in and take you on their journey.[youtube=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_vc6AGKb8&w=560&h=315]

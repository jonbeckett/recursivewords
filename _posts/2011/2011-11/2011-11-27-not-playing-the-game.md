While reading back through the posts of various friends around the internet over the last few days, a creeping realisation has dawned on me. I don't like playing "the game".

By "the game", I'm talking about the attention seeking, the chasing of traffic, the attempted attraction of followers, and the seeking of approval that seems so prevalent throughout so many of the social networks.

I'm not going to do it.

I'm going to follow who I want, because they share great quality content that I enjoy reading. I do not expect those I follow, subscribe, circle, or "friend" to reciprocate. If they happen to investigate who this slightly strange Englishman is who has begun to read and comment, and they decide they like the inconsequential verbiage he pollutes the blogosphere with, then that's fine.

I guess it all comes down to a list of emotive words; originality, truth, honesty, and independence. I hesitate to use the word "interesting" because I fail to see how anybody cannot be interesting in some way or another.

I'll climb down off my soap box now. Move along. Nothing to see here.

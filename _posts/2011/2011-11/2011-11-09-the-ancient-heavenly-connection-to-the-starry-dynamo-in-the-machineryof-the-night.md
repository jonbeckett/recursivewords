Late last night I read a post by a good friend that brought something to mind; I hardly ever tell people how much I value them on the Internet. I have done from time to time in the past, but it's pretty rare.

I guess I've learned the hard way to be pretty careful about showing my true colours. As innocent as a compliment might be, some will see it in an inappropriate light, and others will read far more into it than you intendand there's very little you can do about that, so you end up saying nothing rather than court controversy.

The like, heart, and plus one buttons in the various social networks provide a cover of sortsrather than expressing that we think somebody looks lovely, gorgeous, sexy, wonderful, fantastic, or some other loaded word, we can just tick a "like" button. How much did we like the post, or photo, or video though ?Is it really such a bad thing to sometimes drop our guard, and tell people we like them? Should the preconceptions, assumptions, and judgement of others be our problem, or their problem?I don't have any answers, but I do know that I value the relationships I have with many of the bloggers I regularly read far more than they realise. They help me get through each day, and provide an escape from the mundane, and the routine.

If any of you read this (and you know who you are), thank you for taking the time to notice a fairly ordinary guy, living a fairly unremarkable life. It means a lot.

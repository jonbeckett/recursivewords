I've been in from work perhaps 20 minutesput my bag down, took my coat off, and immediately started cleared the washing up, tidying the lounge up, and picking up all manner of junk. I was promised a cup of tea that never happened, and then the conversation started;"Will you be home on time next Wednesday ?""I have no ideaI might not even be here I told you that a week ago.""Well that's great. That means I have to take the kids with me to get my hair cut.""It's not my fault. Go ring my project manager and complain to him. As far as I know, I'm going to miss all the school plays, and most of Christmas itself this year, because I come last on just about every list of 'who should be asked about anything'""Great. Some Christmas we're going to have then"At that point I walked out of the room, and am now sat here writing this.

Blogging has become an escape for me. Somewhere to empty my thoughts. As much as I hate expressing negativity, sometimes it's good to tell somebody what's churning around your head, even if it's an unknown audience spread all over the world.

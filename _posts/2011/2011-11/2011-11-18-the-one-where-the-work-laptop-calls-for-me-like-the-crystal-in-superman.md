I can't believe another week has flown past. Is it really Friday night again? I'm living a treadmill life at the momentalternating between home and work, house and hotel, and far flung offices. As persuasive as George Clooney might have made it look in "Up in the Air", the reality is very different. It diminishes friendship, erodes creativity, and causes a continual distraction in your subconscious.

For the last several days I have worked straight through lunch. Today I tried to stop myself, and began writing a blog post. The phone rang after a minute or two, and I forgot all about it. While closing the computer down this evening to come home I discovered the text editor still running in the background, and discarded the few words I had written.

Whenever I visit far flung friends on the internet I marvel at the time the time they must havethe time they invest in the friendships they have forged. I'm not jealousmore enviousof how wonderful it might be to have more time more time to spend writing to those I know, making new friends, and sharing with the crowd.

While writing this a worm is burrowing through the back of my mind, telling me that I could be carrying on with the "big huge project" from my day job. The work laptop is in my backpack (I'm off to another hotel on Monday), and is calling to me like the crystal in Superman. It's been doing it all evening.

We woke at 7 this morning with the radio alarm clock, and rolled towards each other. My better half surfaced from the bedclothes mole like, and smiled that smile that says "if you make me a cup of tea, I'll love you forever".

Before I could say "creep", our door creeked open and a little person tiptoed into the room. We looked at each other and then down the bed towards Little Miss 6, who had turned cute up just enough to slide into bed next to us without complaint."What day is it?""Thursday""Shall we all throw a sickie?""All have a duvet day?""Yep"We seriously thought about it. With sun pouring in through the dew soaked bedroom windows, those few moments staring at the ceiling were wonderful. Doomed, but wonderful.

As is usual, I slid out of bed and fell into an autopilot of sortsmarching from bedroom to bedroom wearing not much more than a screwed up t-shirt, drawing curtains, turning lights on, and rousing little people.

By the time the elephants arrived downstairs I had made three breakfasts, and was halfway through a second lunch. A crazy haired grownup wrapped in bathrobes joined me at the kitchen counter, filling the kettle and finding mugs.

Another Thursday had begun.

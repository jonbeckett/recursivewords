We have three catsTom, Sam, and George. Between them they have 27 lives. We should put a totaliser on the kitchen wallbecause it's probably down to 25. I wrote before about George's close encounter with a car, and his rehabilitation. This week it was Tom's turn to cause much worrying, visits to the vet, and gnashing of teeth.

It all started on Monday morning when our eldest daughter noticed Tom was limping on a front foot. This of course caused all the children to surround W and the cat as she poked, prodded, and said worried sounding things. How better to throw an already maniac schedule into disarray than to fit in visits to the vet. So far this week I've made everybody's breakfasts every day, and our evening meal twice. I've also done all the washing up, and tidying up. Not fun.

It turns out (after the vet shaved rather a lot of fur off Tom's leg and shoulder) that he had a pretty impressive puncture wound on his shouldermeaning he had been fightingand his entire leg had become infected.

Sowe get to this morning, and our following off the instruction that the cat needed to be shut in for a few days until the antibiotics had done their work. Ha ha. The vet obviously didn't count on us having three little girls who think they are "being helpful" by doing things like letting the cats out. All of them. Despite the instructions to the contrary.

And so it was that I made myself late for work this morningwandering around our garden and the street outside, looking for any sign of the cat. I nearly left for work once, and something made me turn back. After emailing the office to tell them I was running late, I walked into the back garden once more, patted my legs, clapped my hands, and shouted the cat's nameWhat was that sound?Finally, Mr Shaved Leg turned upin next door's garden. I heard the bell on his collar long before I saw him, and thankfully he came to me, rather than running off at first sight of us in the garden, like they normally do. He's now imprisoned in the living room, and I have got nothing done so far today.

Fantastic.

This morning we were up bright and earlyW was helping man the drink stations for the local half marathon along with the Girl Guides, and I took our younger children down to the central park the half marathon left from for the children's 1 mile fun run.

They did wonderfullyconsidering a lot of the children were older, they didn't get disheartened when most of the field raced off aheadthey kept going, no doubt with thoughts of the goody bag they knew they would receive at the finish.

On the final lap our youngest struggled quite a bit, and almost came to a stop as she neared me with the camera. In all honesty she shouldn't have been in the race at allshe's had a nasty bug all weekendbut we left it up to her. I of course did what any Dad would doI grabbed her hand, and ran with her for the final lap. As we reached the final corner and the run-in to the finish I let go of her hand "RACE YOU TO THE FINISH!". She flew.

Their prize was a bag each containing all manner of sponsored rubbish. Mars bars, Milky Ways, juice drinks, apples, handwash (?!), kitchen cleaner (?!!), and even a bar of scented soap each.

Somehow I think they'll be doing it again next year.

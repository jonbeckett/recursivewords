Well this is a surprisefor the first time in at least a couple of years, I'm sat in a coffee shop on a saturday with a cappuccino, a slice of granola, and half an hour to do as I please. I've just left our eldest daughter warming up with the rest of her team for a football match.

So this is cafe society Ladies of a certain age, sitting reading the paper with a cup of coffeeeither thAt, or young professional women. No men. Odd.

The lady who served me my coffee is over 6ft tall with an athletic physique, and short bleached hair. Shes talking about abs and spinning classes with the other girl behind the counter.

I'm clock watching. This seems so odddoing something on my own It's alien to me after these last few years where I've always been doing something, going somewhere, waiting for somebody, or figuring out what I need to do next.

Another couple just wandered in. She looks like the 60 year old version of Bardot, and he looks like Terry Thomascomplete with tweed blazer and leather elbows. I bet they have a convertible car parked somewhere. And the illusion is ruined She just greeted somebody she knows with a screech of a voice.

I guess I should get on with drinking my coffee, and think about wandering back to the football match

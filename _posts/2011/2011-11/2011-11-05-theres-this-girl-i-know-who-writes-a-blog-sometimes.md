There's this girl I know who writes a blog sometimes. I doubt I will ever meet her because she lives on the other side of the world, but we sort of know each other through reading and commenting over the last year or so.

She's talking about stopping it all. I'll admit I've thought about stopping blogging too from time to timeand yet something draws me back into it each time. Reading her thoughts about stopping this eveningand realising that I would miss her enormously made me realise why I keep going.

My writingthe words I share with the world through the blogis sometimes an olive branch from a world where I would otherwise be cut off. When not clearing the house up behind the children, I am at work. Over the last month the lack of "me" time this sometimes causes has been brought into sharp focusand it will likely continue straight through Christmas this year. Not fun, but it pays the bills. I always end up saying that"it pays the bills"it's become a mantra while having no life to speak of.

I'm drifting from the point of this post (if there ever was one).

What am I saying here?Perhaps that it's time I started being a bit more open on the internettelling the world a little of the people that inspire me, and who I value friendships with. Sure, they'll be embarassed, but hopefully a little bit proud toothat somebody somewhere thought enough of them to shout it from the rooftops.

Katrinathis post is for you. You remind me so much of myself sometimesnever sitting still, always searching, always tinkering, changing, and evolving. We both have unquiet mindswe don't do "nothing" well at all. Your writing is fantastic, and yet you don't know because nobody stopped to tell you. You're also beautiful, but againnobody stopped to tell you because they were perhaps afraid it might cause tongues to wag if they did so. Damn everybody else. You rule. Your blog rules.

This is where I address everybody elsego read Katrina's blog ( http://librariesandlookbooks.tumblr.com [http://librariesandlookbooks.tumblr.com/]), and giver her some feedbackbefore we lose her. Once you get to know her, you'll realise why I'm writing thiswhy I'm taking a stand. She rules.

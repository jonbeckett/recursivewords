I'm not entirely sure why I'm writing anything today. I have nothing much to report, beyond the usual storyGot up, got the kids up, made breakfasts, walked to school with them, went to work, headbanged for a number of hours, returned home, ate dinner, washed up, geeked out. Pretty much the pattern for a normal day around here.

The "geeked out" bit this evening relates to Ubuntu on the desktop PC in the study. After a little tinkering, both displays are now working, the network hard drive is connected, CrashPlan (online backup) is configured to spew everything up to the interwebs, and all seems to be well with the world.

Asleep yet?I'm sat here listening to "Maybe I'm Dreaming" by Owl Cityit's the predecessor to "Ocean Eyes"less well know, but just as good. Grooveshark is quickly becoming an addiction. So much music to be discoveredI'm rambling. Time to shut up.

Just as it was getting dark last night, a chicken appeared through the rain in the back garden and bounced off the patio doors. We raced out into the darkness and discovered piles of feathers. I did a quick headcount in the run, and found three chickens. Where was number four? Have you ever searched a garden in the dark, in pouring rain, with a rubbish torch? It wasn't fun. In the middle of W ranting on about not having put the chickens in earlier, I heard probably the last sound from the chicken, and shouted at W to shup up. We found her a few minutes later, curled up in the bush, obviously dead. We've been here before. This had to be the cats. They have been staking out the chicken run as soon as it gets dark for days. I'm guessing the chicken didn't go back to the run because it was raining, and as darkness fell, the cats saw their opportunity. Two of them probably worked together to do it (they appeared an hour later, soaked to the skin). If it had been a fox, we would only have found feathers, or bits of chicken. The others would all have been dead too. The kids took it on the chin this morning. Growing up with the occasional loss of a chicken has hardened them to the whole "circle of life" story. They eat meat, they know where it comes from, and they've seen lots of dead animals, courtesy of the cats. At this moment they're sat watching Power Rangers, without a care in the world.

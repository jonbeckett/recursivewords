I almost titled this post "Truthful Tuesday", after the regular meme that crops up on Tumblr, but reason prevailed at the last moment, when I recalled the goal I set myself a little while ago; no more memes. This written blog shall not follow the crowd. It shall stand alone, filled with the contents of one of my various heads. I never can tell which head I might be wearing on a given day. Some days I get the clever head, some days the stupid head. Of course it helps if I get the clever head when I need it, but that can't be guaranteed. Just last week I pulled up some source code that others in the office were commenting on as being something of a righteous hack " and realised after looking at it for a while that I had written it. I couldn't figure out how it worked. Sometimes you start the day with a stupid head on, and it turns into a clever head late in the day. That happens to me a lot. It's almost like something switches on late in the afternoon " extra processing capacity or something. I also have it happen in the evening too. In a perfect world, I would work from late afternoon until midnight each day, and then catch up with friends online into the early hours. That would work for me. p.s. listening to "Keep Hope Alive" by "Crystal Method" " suggested by a colleague who's into his electronic music. It's perfect background music for messing around on the internet " straight out of the "Hackers" mould.

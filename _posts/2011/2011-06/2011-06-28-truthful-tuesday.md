In the spirit of "taking part" rather than continually ploughing my own furrow across the internet, I'm taking part in the "Truthful Tuesday" meme for a change. I can't find a definition of the meme anywhere, but juding from what others do, you basically spill your guts for all to read / enjoy / be horrified by / ridicule you about.

Here goes; When I was about five years old I tried to flush the cat down the toilet. My Mum caught me red handed, and asked what I was doing. I stood (in the pool of water where the furious ball of claws and teeth had been a few moments previously) with my hands behind my back, and denied everything. Again, when I was about five years old I decorated the front door of our house with every felt tip I could find. I was really busy for a good hour or so, and did quite an impressive mural. I can still remember trying to stand in front of it so neighbours didn't see it as they walked past. One of them obviously called my Mum on the phone. When Dad got home from work, I couldn't sit down for ages. I once got so drunk on a night out with friends that I couldn't cross a road, and while attempting to do soin the style of a rusty tin manI became petrified that a policeman would see me, and fine me for being drunk and disorderly. I met my other half on the internet back when it was rare to do so. For years "our story" was a great dinner party story, because nobody else we knew had met like that. Now of course, it's by far the most common way that anybody meets.

I could go on and on with these revelationssome of which would be entertaining, some would be deadly boringfor hours. I'll relieve you of that burden, and shut up.

Now if you'll excuse me, I am off to watch our eldest compete in her school sports dayexpect idiotic photos later.

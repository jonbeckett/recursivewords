In the spirit of "keeping it simple", I'm going to stop the cross posting craziness. It won't mean much for those who read the garbage I pollute the internet with, but it will mean I use the various blogs and services a little differently WordPresswill remain as the primary blog. I will continue posting my daily thoughts, ideas, frustrations, and general idiocy to be trampled upon by the passing crowd. Tumblrwill continue to be polluted with random photos from my mobile phone, and perhaps the odd participation in a memebut not much else. I don't like that Tumblr has no public commenting, and does some things very strangely. The community is it's only real redeeming feature. Posterouswill end at this post. I like the idea of posterous, and it has some great ideas, but it's just not implemented well enough. Odd issues crop up all over the place that turn a potentially brilliant blogging platform into a frustrating one. Bloggerwill end at this post. The authoring experience in WordPress is just better. It's as simple as that.

Let's make this simple; WordPressverbose wonderfullness Tumblrabridged garbageMake sense ?

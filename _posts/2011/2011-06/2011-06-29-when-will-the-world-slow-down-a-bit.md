Some days start stupidly, and failing an injection of common sense (which we have very little of around here at the moment), they continue ongathering pace, becoming more idiotic, and approach avalanche proportions.

Miss 10 is going to France tomorrow with school. We have to deliver her to the school gates by 6am. Yeahyou read that right6am. They are travelling over on a ferry for the day, and visiting a coastal town (is it terrible that I have no idea where?). I imagine it will just be somewhere near the port, because at least five hours of the day will be spent on the boat.

Sogiven that she really needed to be at school today for any final instructions about the coming trip, guess who got up this morning and pretended to be too poorly to go to school?After a few minutes of persuasion I was getting nowhereand pretty much lost it. I explained that if she didn't go to school she wouldn't be able to go on the school trip, so we might as well have set fire to the money it cost.

Somehow or other I performed a feat of kidology, and she got dressed for school. Of course the entire standoff meant our normally finely oiled machine of a house didn't deliver the kids out of the front door by the normal timeso we ended up all going our separate ways I walked Miss 10 to school (who was miraculously getting better by the minute), and W drove the little ones to school in a manner better befitting a rally driver.

Miraculously, everybody arrived where they should have on time. And that's why it winds me up when people arrive for things late. Every (normal) morning in our house starts at 7am with a race against time to get everybody where they need to be, with the things they need, by the time they need to be there.

Perhaps I worry too much about everything. Perhaps I should kick back, be late like other people are, not care about being prepared for anything, borrow off others, and do all the other things that normally annoy the crap out of me.

Life must be so much easier for people who don't care.

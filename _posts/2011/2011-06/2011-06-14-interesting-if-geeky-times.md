I rule. Linux rules. I can now open a terminal window at work, and connect directly to the computer at home, use it, and see what it's doing. It's only a terminal connection, but it's still pretty cool. It probably says something about me that while running back and forth helping with the morning routine this morning, I unlocked the desktop and checked what happened with the backup overnight. I was hoping CrashPlan would kick off at 2am, connect to the external storage on the network at home, and start backing up over 100 gigabytes of data. That's exactly what happened. The backup will take several weeks, but by doing it in the dead of night, it's not going to impact either our broadband "fair use" cap, or our own use of the internet. It's nice when things work.

Now here's something interesting. I got the USB ZIP drive working in Windows 7 (a feat in itself), and have just been digging through the contents of the old disks. Among the decade old collection of files I found this. I painted it about 15 years ago, not long after I finished college. The original was much bigger than this image suggestsI could only fit this much in the scanner, and digital cameras hadn't been invented. I'm not quite sure if I sold it on EBay or Yahoo (who had an auction site back in the day too). I remember the painting being involved in some kind of bidding war, and eventually being bought by somebody moving into an apartment in New York, looking for interesting and original artwork. I had completely forgotten about it until I found the scanned image.

So yeah, I've sold artwork internationally

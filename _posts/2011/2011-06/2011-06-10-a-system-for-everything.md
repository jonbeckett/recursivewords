One of my oldest online friends commented last night that I have a system for everything. She didn't mean it in a bad way; she was just making an observation. After thinking about it for a while, I realised she's probably right. Some examples; My bookmarks bar in Chrome is filled with folders " for Google (Mail, Calendar, etc), Blogging (Posterous, WordPress, etc), Social Networks (Twitter, Facebook, etc), Social Media (Flickr, YouTube, etc), Tools (Netvibes, Instapaper, etc), Helpers (various bookmarklets), and Diversions (PopURLs, BuzzFeed, etc). They sync across the various computers I use. I keep a "Journal" folder in Dropbox, with a text file for each month of the year. In markdown format, I write what I have been doing each day so when it comes time to fill out my time sheet, no guessing is needed. I keep serial numbers and logins in a secure volume in DropBox, encrypted by TrueCrypt. The password is ridiculously strong. I am pretty close to Inbox Zero in GMail " I star stuff I need to do, and delete everything I have done. I only archive emails I want to keep for posterity (photos from friends, for example). Typically there are only three or four emails in the inbox. Yes, I am mad. I used to be a "Remember the Milk" fanatic too, but seem to have cured myself of that particular idiocy. I pretty much rely on Google Calendar these days to remind me I need to do things. If something's not tied to a date, I don't really need to know about it.

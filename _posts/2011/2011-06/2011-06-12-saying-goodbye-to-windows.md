I'm in the process of backing up our desktop PC. Later today, I'm going to wipe it, and install Ubuntu Linux. I've been running Ubuntu on the netbook for weeks, and it has been flawless. The only app we will really miss is Microsoft Office (and then only because of Publisher) " I could create a virtual machine with office on purely for those rare occasions. If you're wondering why we're doing it, there's a few reasons; We live in our browsers now All our files are stored on a network storage device We have a network printer We use netbooks and/or laptops typically The desktop machine has no major function any more Why invest cost in a desktop machine, when it could quite happily run a free OS that is much lighter, and better tailored to cloud services ? Our only real software requirements are DropBox, CrashPlan, and Picasa " and they are all available for Linux. I'll let you know how it goes. Apparently the backup could take another 3 hours

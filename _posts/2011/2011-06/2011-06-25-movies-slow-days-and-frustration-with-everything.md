Do you ever watch an entire day vanish in front of your eyes, and become frustrated because you know it's the weekend, there's only one day of it left, you're not getting to do anything you would really like to, and you know you're not going to get to do anything you want to anyway ?That's the kind of day I'm having.

Here goes the vent Have felt like crap since I got up this morning. At first I thought it might have been something to do with drinking a couple of glasses of red wine last night (on top of a couple of glasses of white wine), but I haven't got any better. Given that our eldest has a virus at the moment, I'm wondering if it's that. Missed F1 qualifying because I had to pick our youngest up from a birthday party. Formula One is just about the only sport I will spend time watching on television, and somehow something will always happen to make watching it difficult. We're going to be out tomorrow at the exact time the F1 race isI'll try and catch it on the radio, but I know from past experience that the radio coverage is hilariously badespecially with Wimbledon being on. I just spent the last couple of hours cutting the grasswith pretty much the only motivation being to avoid getting nagged at. I got no thanks. Completely missed the MotoGP race coverage from Assen. Would really have liked to order Chinese food for dinner, but we can never get it because one of our children can't eat it (coeliac), and another won't eat it (don't even ask). Instead, on a baking hot day we are having cooked dinner. That means an hour of washing up for me later, because we have to do a gluten free option, a veggie option, and a normal option.

I'm turning into a real oldcurmudgeon, aren't I. If there's been something good to take from this weekend, it was last nightwe did our semi-regular thing of inviting a gang of friend over to watch a movie, eat loads of pizza, and drink too much wine.

The movie was "Easy A", which I hadn't anticipated being any good at alleven though I had never heard of it before. Turned out to be pretty fantastic. The IMDB synopsis reads as follows;After a little white lie about losing her virginity gets out, a clean cut high school girl sees her life paralleling Hester Prynne's in "The Scarlet Letter," which she is currently studying in schooluntil she decides to use the rumor mill to advance her social and financial standing.

I haven't enjoyed a movie so much in ages. The lead character begins recording a video blog early in the movie, and it's used as a device for her to talk directly to the audience throughout the moviemuch as Michael Caine did in Alfie. The movie was by turns smart, clever, sharp and funnyand the cast was stellar. Standout for me was probably Stanley Tucci as Olive's Dad, Emma Stone as Olive, closely followed by Thomas Haden Church (Sideways)as her english lit. tutor.

Here's the trailer[youtube=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNbPnqyvItk&w=560&h=349]I will admit to silently laughing into my shirtsleeves at another movie that tore huge strips off religious people. I realise it's a chip on my shoulder, but it was still pretty funny to see another mainstream movie sticking the knife inthis time far more directly and sarcastically even than "Paul".

Anyway dinner time is racing towards us, and I have washing up to do (yeah washing up before dinnerI'll take the MP3 player into the kitchen to fill my head with something constructive while I get through it).

Here's to your Saturday, and the hope that it's better than mine.

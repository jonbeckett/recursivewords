It's Thursday, it's lunchtime, and the world is finally slowing down a little for me. Lunchtime is my own once more, and affords the opportunity to write, and to catch up with friends.

I focus too much. I typically become so involved in what I'm doing that I lose track of time, forget to eat, and fail to hear conversations going on around meeven directed towards me. No matter how noisy the office gets, I seem able to switch off everything around me. I've always been able to do it.

So. Sat here listening to Joshua Radin, writing this, and wondering in my subconscious how to use up my final days of holiday for the year. I need to check with HRI have ten days to use up before the end of July (our holiday year begins and ends at the end of July -something to do with the formation of the company way back in the distant past). I'm not sure how many days I can carry over.

A whole week off, or a day off every week through June and July? I could do either.

Oh, the possibilities Sitting in Starbucks with the netbook (on my own!), writing blog posts Going for a walk along the river for no reason what so ever Sitting inside on a rainy day reading a good bookActually, the "sitting inside" one is probably a mistake, because it will inevitably turn into "put three loads through the washing machine, iron 2000 pieces of childrens clothing, change the children's beds, tidy up the playroom", and any number of other chores.

I wonder if I can actually sit in a cafe without feeling guilty about not getting on with chores at home ? This gets back to the whole personality trait of doing things for others all the time, doesn't it. Perhaps it really is time I invested in "me" for a changeeven if only for a day now and againrecharge the batteries.

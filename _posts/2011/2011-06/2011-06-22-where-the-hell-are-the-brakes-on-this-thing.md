You'll excuse me if I sound a little hassled, or a little breathless. It's approaching 5pm, and it's the first opportunity I've had to stop all day. I've drunk coffee while frowning at piles of errant source code, held bread rolls in my mouth while typing furiously, and spent at least an hour trying to solve a problem that didn't even exist.

Can I come up with an analogy to illustrate my stupidity? You know how you have to put fuel in a car before the engine will run? Well I spent an hour turning the keys in the ignition, and taking the engine to pieces before I realised. In reality I was looking at webservices, javascript, and C#, but that's a bit harder to explain.

In other news, the sun is shining outside. You might not think this of any particular note, but if you had been here a little while ago you would have been searching for life preservers and oars. I'm not kidding. I heard the rain over the music in my headphones, and turned to find colleagues gazing at the downpour in wonder. To think a cloud could have remained airborne with the quantity of water being dumped on us defied logical thinking.

While checking Google Calendar just now, I discovered my other half may be heading into town with other school Mums this evening to cause trouble. If I manage to clear the decks before the kids go to bed, that affords me the chance to hit the blogging community and search out old friends.

It's been too long.

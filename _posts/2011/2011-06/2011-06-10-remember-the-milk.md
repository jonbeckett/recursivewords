Oh no I didn't... Oh yes I did...I installed "Remember the Milk" on my phone, and am about to integrate it into GMail to annoy the crap out of me. I'll try it for the couple of weeks that it's free, and if I actually use it, I'll pay for it. In other news, I've been looking at the Chromebooks again... time to start saving I guess (and selling body parts).

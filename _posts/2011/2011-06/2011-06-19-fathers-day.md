A few photographs to remember the dayI would like to report an easy day filled with relaxation, but as with most days around here, it was anything but. We argued over chores, we fought with the children, W burned her fingers while cooking dinner, and I washed up perhaps six times during the day.

It's now 10:30pm and the dishwasher is stillrunning.The washing machine has been running non stop all day.

Everybody else is now in bed. I'm sat downstairs on my own having tidied everything belonging to everybody else away. Jushua Radin is pumping out of the laptop speakers into the silent house, and the hum of the fish-tank pump reverberates in the background. I switched the TV off some time ago.

I got invited into the Google+ field trial (read:beta) late last nightif you have no idea what on earth I'm referring to, "Google+" is the social network that Google has been quietly working on for the last year or two. Everybody knew they were working on something just nobody knew exactly what it was.

I'm going to come right out and say it : Google+ is by far the best social network I have ever seen, or used.

It's spectactular. I imagine the wizards atop the Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr towers will be building an army right now

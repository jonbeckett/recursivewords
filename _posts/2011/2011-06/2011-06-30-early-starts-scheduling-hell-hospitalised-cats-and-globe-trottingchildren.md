I've been sat here for the last few moments thinking about how I might even start to describe the day. I've got nothing. The only phrase that comes to mind is "damn"... Got up at 5am Got eldest daughter to school for 6am for France trip Messed around with Google+ for an hour Got younger children up, dressed, and ready for school Cycled to work Had my schedule re-written twice during the day for the next week - to work on completely different projects Submerged in HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, and assorted graphics applications throughout most of the day - working on a website re-write for the company Returned home via the supermarket after a late call from my better half Arrived home to find out one of our cats had been hit by a car Travelled to vet with said cat, checked him in, sorted out insurance - it's going to cost thousands - hopefully insurance will cover most of it Home, eldest arrived home from trip at 11pm Sorted out all manner of issues for friends via Google Talk Wrote thisI wonder what tomorrow will bring ?

A few minutes ago several thousand bees landed on the roof of the house opposite the office I work in. A house where we know a small child lives with her mother. For a few minutes the swarm remained stationary over the roof, before concentrating on one chimney, and slowly dissappearing down it. After running around the three floors of our building making sure everybody shut their windows, somebody noticed the young family living in the house directly underneath the swarm was in. Nobody reacted. After retrieving the black hoodie from my desk (I'm wearing a bright coloured t-shirt today, and didn't think that the best idea in the world to wear while walking under a swarm of bees), I walked over and banged on their door. While wandering back, the Batman quote came to mind " "it's what you do that defines you".

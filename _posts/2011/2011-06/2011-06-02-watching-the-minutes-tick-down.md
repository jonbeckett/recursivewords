It's been the kind of day that could have gone off the rails at any point, but didn't because you hang on, and pretty much force it to go the way you want by brute force. Of course the flipside to such a crazy day is I am now tired, but also completely wired sat here fidgeting, and wondering what to do with myself " hence the blog post. There's an hour left of the day, and I didn't stop for lunch, so am trying to tell myself that I can sit here and write this without any guilt for the next little while " but of course a little voice on my shoulder is whispering "slacker!" in my ear. I haven't really shared much on the blog recently, have I " sure, I've posted photos, but I haven't really written much. I wonder if people really want to read. Take no notice I'm just a bit burned out.

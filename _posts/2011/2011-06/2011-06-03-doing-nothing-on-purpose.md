I have ten minutes of work left, and I'm doing nothing. On purpose. You might think this lazy, but I worked straight through lunch today. I did the age old trick of being so involved in what I was doing I forgot to eat. Suddenly feeling incredibly weak, I rummaged in my bag, and pulled out the rather wonderful sandwiches I made this morning. I stuffed them in my face while carrying on fighting with piles of javascript, html, and web services. Work today was like one of those whack-a-mole games. As soon as I got one thing working, something else broke. That pretty much happened all day long. There was a good side to it though " eventually everything worked. Everything did as it was told. The computers surrendered to my will. And ever since, I've sat here on my ass, wondering how to waste the remains of the day. Thank f*ck it's Friday

I just posted this to Tumblr. I had thought about cross-posting the exact same words into here, but then thought that might be a bit lazy. I think too much.

The above came about while sat here noodling around with Linux, listening to music, and kicking my heals. I don't do "nothing" very well at all. I had a half hour window inbetween washing up, tidying up, and falling into bedand the above is the resultscribbled into the moleskine notebook while listening to Joshua Radin once more.

I had planned to listen to a podcast or two, but forgot all about it while nerding out over the doodles. That probably says a lot about me. The album I was listening to finished a few minutes ago, and I've carried on writing this rather than put anything else on. That probably says something about me too.

Anyway. There it is.

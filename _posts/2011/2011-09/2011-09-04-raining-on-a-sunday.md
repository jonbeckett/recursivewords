The rain is steadily falling outside, our eldest is playing on the Gamecube with a friend, and the younger children have gone shopping with my better half. I find myself with an almost unheard of second afternoon in a rowto myself.

Time to catch up, to empty my head, to explore, to make new friends, to listen to music, and to do what I want for a change.

Of course saying that, the phone has run three times in the last five minutes, with a ranting other half on the other endattempting to send photos from her phone of lunchboxes for our eldest to choose from. Serves her right for expecting her Blackberry to do anything predictably.

So who to follow on Tumblr?

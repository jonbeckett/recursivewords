This is getting a bit silly. I've been working on a big sort-of-secret project at work for weeks now. It hasn't just eaten up hoursit's bitten off entire weeks, chewed them up, and spat them back out again.

I can't remember the last time I stopped properly for lunch. Take today as an exampleit's now 4:11pm, and it's the first time I've stopped since arriving before 9 this morning. And what am I doing? Writing this. I should probably be out in the fresh hair for a few minutes, stretching my legs, and giving my eyes a rest but no. I'm reading the Tumblr dashboard, catching up with Twitter, and clearing spam from my mail.

What do you do when you're supposed to be taking a break (from life, or work)?Do you end up surfing rubbish on the net like I was at 1am this morning?

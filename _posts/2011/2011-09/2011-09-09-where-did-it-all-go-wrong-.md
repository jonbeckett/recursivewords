The picture above is of a cartridge for the Atari VCS 2600 video game that everybodyhad in the early 1980s. It was the first successful home video game machine, and introduced millions of living rooms to Space Invaders, Pacman, Missile Command, Asteroids, and more. I can still remember mum becoming hopelessly addicted to Pinball, and getting pretty nasty about letting anybody else have a go.

We'll ignore the fact that the above picture is of perhaps the worst product ever invented by anybody ever (apart from ET for the Atari, which is legendarily bad, and almost single handedly killed the video game market in the early 80s).

AnywayApparently the picture above shows some software developer guy, wearing a spacesuit, surrounded by dials, buttons, knobs, blinking lights, displays, readouts, and all manner of other amazing looking stuff.

I'm a software developer.

Where's my spacesuit?This afternoon I'm sat here in jeans and a t-shirt. The computer in front of me just has a few buttons with letters on itwhere are the knobs, dials, sliders, readouts, and blinky lights? Why can't computers be more like the Tardis in Dr Who, and looklike you need to know how they workPerhaps I was born in the wrong decade.

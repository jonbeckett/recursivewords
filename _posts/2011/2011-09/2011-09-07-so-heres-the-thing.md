Ever since I started using Tumblr more, I deluded myself that I could quite happily write two blogsthe big tome that nobody reads in WordPress, and this one in Tumblr.

I just took a look at the visitor statsWithout pushing it at all, the Tumblr one is getting more traffic than WordPress. That's not taking into account the Tumblr dashboard traffic, which is probably three or four times the number of hits.

The question then becomes"do I carry on with the WordPress blog?"If this is where people are reading, what's the point in writing elsewhere?I guess some of the basis for these thoughts is my increased workload now I'm doing freelance work again. Perhaps I shouldput the archives of the WordPress blog away, and shut it once and for all.

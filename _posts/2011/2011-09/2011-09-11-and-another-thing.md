Perhaps I'm just old and unbearably cycnical, but reading the various news outlets today, it's almost a competition to see who can cook up the best mixture of faux emotion, gravitas, and soapbox psychology into their editorial pieces about the September 11th attacks.

I prefer to remember September 15th.

We got married on September 15th 2001.

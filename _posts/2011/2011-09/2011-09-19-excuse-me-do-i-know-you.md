It feels like such a long time since I have written anything of substance in the blog. I'm also aware that I've not "been around" either; not read many of my friends posts, not commented on their thoughts, answered their questions, or "liked" their photos.

I've basically been a rubbish friend, and I'm doing something about it.

I just decimated my follower list on tumblr. I knowsome people are going to get angry about being unfollowed, but it's unavoidable; I just don't have the time to follow lots and lots of peopleif I follow you, I would hope to read most of the stuff you post; otherwise what's the point of following you?

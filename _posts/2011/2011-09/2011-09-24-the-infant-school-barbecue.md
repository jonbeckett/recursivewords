Our Saturday began with the explosion of an alarm clock from our eldest's bedroom at 6:30am. She has been learning to tell the time properly, so had borrowed the bedside alarm clock. Apparently she now knows what the big button on top of the clock does.

The rest of the morning unfolded as Saturday mornings generally do in our house; little one off to Rainbows, Miss 11 watching cartoons in her pyjamas, and Dad letting the chickens out, washing up, cleaning the kitchen, and listening to the local radio station.

Little Miss 7 arrived downstairs this morning looking a little forlorn. She had remembered the repurcussions of her Karate display the previous eveningthat had culminated in kicking her little sister in the chest "Crouching Tiger" style because she was "holding her nightie". Grounded for two weeks. She had been drinking Coca Cola at a birthday partyAs is typical in these situations, the very next day (today) we were due to attend the infant school barbecue, so of course the grounding had to be lifted. Why does that alwayshappen?The barbecue was great. I'm finally remembering the names of the parents that know who I am, so it makes it a little lessembarrassingwhen faces I know greet me. I still have no clue who's children are who's I think you only learn that if you either stand at the school gate every evening, or work in the school (which W does).

An interesting thing happened at the barbecueour children learned not to ask for specific things from the food and drinks standthey just asked for money. Damn they're getting crafty. While catching up with fellow parents in the school field, little people repeatedly sidled up to me and tugged on my shorts. As I dropped coins into each of their hands, I suddenly realised the "Married with Children" scene was coming to pass.

I'm guessing it's only going to get more expensive from this point on

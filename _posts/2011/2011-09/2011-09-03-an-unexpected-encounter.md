There is this little girl that the kids play with outsidethe prettiest girl in the neighbourhood by a mile. She is slim, leggy, has long dark hair, tanned skin, and a model face. I've often wondered what her Mum looked likewondered if it was the glamorous dark haired lady that I stopped one day a couple of years ago because her Porsche had a tail light out.

Well.. the little girl was at our house all afternoonplaying with our kids in the back gardenhelping paint things, picking apples, and just hanging out with us. A little later, I was checking email in the study when there was a knock at the door.

This short, massively overweight woman with dark hair, and gold makeup that must have been applied with earth moving machinery stood in the doorway, gawping at me."Is my daughter here?"Cogs turned pretty damn quickly in my head."Yepfollow me"Said woman marched through our house, onto the decking in the Garden. W looked up and said a cheerful "Hi!"."Where the FCK have you been? I TOLD you to STAY INSIDE!get home now before I smack your FCKING"I didn't know where to look, or what to sayneither did W. They marched out of the house, and the door slammed behind them.

Unbelievable

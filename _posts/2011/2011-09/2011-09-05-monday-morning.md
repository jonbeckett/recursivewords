I was on orders to take the kids into town today to buy various bits and bobsor at least I would have been if somebody had washed any of their underwear.

Everything is being delayed by a couple of hours while a load goes through the washing machine and dryer and a colossal quantity of kids underwear is being added to the list of things I'm wasting my day off truding round the shops buying.

Not happy.

For the record, it's half past nine, I've already washed up twice, tidied the lounge and kitchen, put endless crap away, fed the chickens, and the house still looks like a wreck.

Fun times. Not.

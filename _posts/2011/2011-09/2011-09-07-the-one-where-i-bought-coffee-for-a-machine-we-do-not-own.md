This must be some kind of prize winning effort on my part. While travelling home from work this evening I called in at the supermarket to buy cat food. Given that the route to the cat food was blocked by idiots (read: normal people, but they were in my way), I walked down the next aisle.

Ooolookinstant coffee in boxes. They're on offer! I'll have one of those.

When I got home, W said "what's that?""Oh I think it's one of those coffee things like you get in cafs, where you put the filter on top of the mug".

It wasn't.

Turns out this box is full of refills for some hilariously stupid plastic coffee maker called a "Dolce Gusto". I looked on Amazon and discovered they cost more than 2 Nintendo DS games (the rate of currency by which everything is judged in our house at the moment).

That means I won't be getting one.

Does anybody want the coffee?

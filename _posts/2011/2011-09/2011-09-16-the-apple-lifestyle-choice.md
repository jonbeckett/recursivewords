I am slowly being pulled back into the Apple universe, and way of life. Recent readers of my online navel gazage are probably unaware that I used to have a Macbook, and of course the kids have an old G3 Mac in the playroom (one of the old TV shaped oneswhich they love to bits). I've had two iPhones in the past tooand will probably go back to iPhone when the Android contract runs out.

Perhaps I should start looking for black polo necks, jeans, and sneakers after I finish at the Apple Store tomorrow morning?

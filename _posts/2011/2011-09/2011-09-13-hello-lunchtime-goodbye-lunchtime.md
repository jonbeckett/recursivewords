That breeze I can feel is lunchtime whizzing past. In the past 24 hours, I have completed the following (in no particular order)Created an online portal to help keep on top of freelance workCreated a template invoice for freelance work, generated the first invoice, and got it paid immediately (yay!)Finished the design of the cards for the local dance teacherCreated a new headed paper design for the local primary schoolTouched base with my cousin in San Francisco about web development projects.

Read a bit of "Ready Player One"Played with the new Posterous websiteChanged projects I'm working on in the office twice.

It's mad.

At least I know I can go buy an iPad at some point now.

It's approaching 8:30am on Saturday morning. I've been up for an hour alreadyhad a wash, brushed teeth, got dressed, washed up, tidied kitchen, tidied lounge fairly normal start to the day.

There is still very little noise from the playroom. Our eldest had several friends over for a sleepover last night, after going out for pizza together for her birthday (I missed it because I had to work late). It's nother actualbirthday until Sunday, so I wasn't too worriedwe'll do something then for her birthday.

Once again I am in a house full of women. I always seem to be surrounded by womenit's just the number that varies. Every day in our house -four. When we went on the bike ride on holiday -seven. This morning -five.

Perhaps it's no accident that most of my real world and internet friends are almost exclusively women too. I've never really been into the whole "guy" thingcars, extreme sports, and so on. I guess the fact that I write a blog at all explains a lot.

Anyway.

I'm heading into town later on the trainto the Apple Store in Reading to buy an iPad. If they're out of stock I will probably cry. Can you imagine an Apple Store being out of iPads?This afternoon we're supposedto be going to a picnic for adopterswe've been for the past several years, and it's always great to see old faces; the team that matched us with our children and changed all of our lives.

Rain is forecast. Lots of it. Lets hope it stays away.

Think good thoughts.

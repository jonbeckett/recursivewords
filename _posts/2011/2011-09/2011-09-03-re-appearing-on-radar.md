We arrived home late on Thursday night, it's now mid-morning on Saturday, and this is the first time I have really had some time to myselfsome time to hit the interwebs, catch up with friends, read about your adventures, and slow things down a bit.

The washing machine is running, we've run out of clothes pegs, I've swept the entire house, the windows are open, the garden is clear, the kids are out buying new school clothes, and I've had a huge argument with my better half (that was forgotten two minutes laterwe're kind of like that).

Main achievement of the morning has been dropping all the frame poles from a gazebo onto my feet while trying to put it in the loft. I'm still not sure how I got away with just a chunk of toe missingby rights, I should have broken several bones in my feet. Holy crap did it hurt for a few minutesIn other news, I just opened a new bank account to do freelance work. I was quite shocked how easy and quick it wasI'm guessing the banks are fighting each other to be "easier to use". Within five minutes of starting the online registration, I was informed I had an account, and the logins and so-on were being mailed to me.

Why can't everything be that easy?

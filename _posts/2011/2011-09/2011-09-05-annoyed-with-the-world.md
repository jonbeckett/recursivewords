I've had enough with the world today. I'm not quite sure if it's because my holiday is coming to an end, or because I've only had a few minutes to myself since I got up this morning.

This morning I got landed with taking the children shopping for clothes, shoes, and stationary for school. In the end it was fine, because we found everything we needed to get immediately, and bumped into a parent I like along the way.

Arriving home, the fun started. Just after getting backand finally thinking "Yaysome time to myself"there came a knock at the door, and a friend of our youngest marched straight into the house. He's the sweetest little guy, but he is too young to understand anything about boundaries. Like a fool I said it was fine for him to stay with us for the afternoonhis mum nearly skipped as she walked away from our front doorknowing damn well I was going to get no peace at all.

I thought I had them all set with a movie.

I thought I might get a few minutes peace and quiet. Just as a I started reading a few friends blog posts, a little voice bellowed in my ear "MY DAD IS AT WORK""Is he?" (my head slumped to the desk)"MY DAD IS, MY DAD IS, MY DAD IS NOT AT HOME, MY DAD IS AT WORK" (I wondered if this is what the loud guy in Dilbert sounds like)"Yes. He is.""WHAT ARE YOU DOING?""Nothing now""WHY ARE YOU DOING NOTHING NOW?""Because you're talking to me." (shouting actually, but lets not split hairs)"WHAT IS THAT?"Somehow at this point our youngest distracted him. She knowsthey are not allowed to stick around in the study. We put this rule in place really early in their livesthe study is "the grown up room"it prevents things going missing, or turning upside down.

Anyway.

The day rolled on pretty much in the same manner. I didn't get a chance to sit and do anything I wanted tono time to concentrate. Even nowwhile writing this, Little Miss 7 is stood at the top of the stairs shouting at the top of her voice to another child stood outside.

I have another day of this.

They really need to go back to schoolotherwise I'll string them up.

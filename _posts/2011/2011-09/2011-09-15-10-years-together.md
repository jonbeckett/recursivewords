Somebody asked me earlier if we were doing anything special."I haven't seen W since breakfast time, and I doubt I will see her until 9 this eveningin the meantime, the groceries are arriving, one of the kids is at Brownies, another is at an after school club, and the other will be at a friend's house after school. Our eldest's birthday is on Sunday, so Wend will be making a cake too"The person who asked suddenly looked sheepish"So no, we're not doing anything special. I did order flowers yesterday thoughbeing delivered this morning hopefully to W's work".

W works in the office at the local infant school. Apparently the flowers earned quite a few bonus points, because they had lilies in themalmost the same kind that were in W's wedding flowers. She couldn't believe I remembered. Neither could the teachers at school.

I have visions now of teacher's husbands poking me, and saying "thanks for that" lolWe ate pizza for dinner, cooked at 9pm inbetween other things, and scoffed along with a bottle of wine. W is busy baking now, and I'm about to go help tidy up some more.

It never stops. This is life as we know it.

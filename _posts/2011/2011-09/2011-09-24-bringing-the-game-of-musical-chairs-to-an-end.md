Over the past few months my blogging antics would probably have qualified me for a padded cell in an asylum. I've written here, at Tumblr, at Posterous, at Blogger, back at Tumblr again, and finally back here again.

I've had enough of it.. I'm not going to chase "the next greatest platform", or "the most active community" any more. This is it. My little island on the web, where I expound thoughts, ideas, and opinions. I'll carry on dipping a toe into the waters around my little islandyes, that means you, Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, and Google+, but the majority of my story will be told here.

I thought about writing all manner of reasons why the expedition through the blogosphere has come to an endpicking apart faults in platforms, the nature of the various communities, and the hilarity of people's reactions to the grand fight that's forming between the social network giants. Then I thought "why bother".

I need to get back to writing about the days of our lives. Recording the really interesting stuffwhat the kids said, what the kids did, what I did that I wish I hadn't, what I saw today that made me smile, or frown.

I've started thinking about what to get my better half for our wedding anniversary (it's in a few days). Normally we don't bother doing anything too specialbut this time it's 10 years, so I'm thinking I should organise somethingat least. Convention dictates that 10 years should be marked in some way.

I started thinking about a Spa dayperhaps I send her away to somewhere nice to have bits of cucumber stuck on her, hot rocks thrown at her, and oozing gunk spread on her (don't I make it sound great).

A part of me says a Spa day isn't a good idea for an anniversary presentbecause we should be doing something together. Buying her tickets for a Spa is kind of like saying "Happy Anniversary, now go away for the day"Maybe we just go out somewhere nice for the daychildren includedmaybe a movie, and something nice to eat?I don't know. I really don't know.

We're not materialist at allso trinkets, or baubles will not be valued or appreciated.

Any ideas?

Some random stuff first;It's Thursday morning9:20am at the time of writingI just had the first shave in two daysThe kids are outside in the sunshine playingBetter half isn't out of bed yetSat in my parents lounge with the netbookThis is the first thing I've really written on the internet all weekWe go home later today. Back to washing up, tidying up, and tackling our jungle of a garden. There will be hundreds of rotten apples to pick up, and all manner of brambles to chop back.

Not looking forward to it.

Have to go nowthree little girls to put through the bath before we head home. A week's worth of dirt, sand, and grime to wash out of their hair

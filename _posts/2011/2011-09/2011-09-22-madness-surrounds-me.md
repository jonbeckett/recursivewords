Working through lunch seems to have become something of a habit recently. It's not something I ever set out to do, but it keeps happening. This entire week has had that feeling; it's been the kind of week where you start full of optimism, plans and ideas, and within minutes you realise that no, it was ridiculous to think you might be doing what you thought you would be doing.

Ten minutes to go. What can I write about for ten minutes? Perhaps the changes that are happening to Facebook at the moment. Over the last 48 hours a number of changes to the news feeds and friending mechanism have been rolled out across the network, and it seems to have insighted anarchy.

I was pretty annoyed too, until I saw a rather humorous poster calling out all the complainers for bitching about a free service that's in no way answerable to them (a bit like the recent Posterous Spaces debacle).

A little later this evening the F8 conference will kick off in San Francisco, and Mr Zuckerberg will take to the stage to unveil what Mashable are calling hugechanges to the Facebook platform. The smart money says they will begin streaming music, but I'm wondering if they will go further. Will it be video chat, and streaming television too?If you can stream webcam video, what's to stop you doing television and movies on-demand (apart from license agreements) ?I guess we'll find out in the next hour, and probably discover all they're doing is changing the colour of the Facebook logo or something.

Back in the real world, it's "Brownies" tonight, which means little or no chance until much later in the evening to do any freelance webdesign work. It was "Guides" last night, which meant the same story. I finally sat down at about 10:30pmit's not even funny any more.

Here's hoping we have food this evening (this morning was like a scene from Goldilocks as we searched the cupboards). The groceries shouldbe delivered today, but given the Tesco random delivery generator, they could turn up at any point over the next few days.

Do I win an award for random subjects covered in one blog post?

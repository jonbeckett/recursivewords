In between tidying up after the kids, feeding pets, and putting things away, I'm tryingto have a relaxed Saturday.

Today that means amazing music from days gone byfrom the likes of Billy Joel, Elton John, Jackson Browne, James Taylor, Journey, Eagles, Simon and Garfunkel, and Chicago.

I always forget how much I love music.

Here's where I take issue with the "community" here, and call them out for their stupidity in this entire "blackout" idiocy.(for those that are not aware, lots of people are claiming they will not be posting today, because a widely used browser extension that adds some functionality to Tumblr is in the process of being banned)The "Missing E" extensionhas always knowingly broken the terms of the Tumblr End User License Agreement that everybody signs up to in order to use the service.

The Tumblr API and interface are designed the way they are on purpose. They work the way the designers and engineers of the service intend them to worknot the way you, or the author of an extension wants them to work.

If you're not happy with the way Tumblr works out-of-the-box, there is nothing to stop you shuttering your account and walking away. You are not paying for anything. Tumblr owe you nothing.

Why am I seeing the people crying "blackout" posting all over the place?

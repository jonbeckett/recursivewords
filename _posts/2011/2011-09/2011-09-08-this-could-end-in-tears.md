I'm following an online tutorial to change the low level configuration of my HTC Desire phone. If it works, I can fill it up with more applications than you can throw a very large bag of sticks at. If it doesn't work, the phone will probably be buggered.

If I become the most grumpy person in the known universe later, you know what's happened.

Some background info for the nerds out thereHTC bestowed the "Desire" with less internal memory than a goldfish, which means if you add Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, Google Maps, FourSquare, and a few other apps, you soon run completely out of memory, which isn't the best idea in the world really.

This "hack" changes the default installation location of apps to external storage (the memory card). With a little luck, it means the room available for apps will increase from 100Mb to as big a memory card as I put in the phone.

Like I said only time will tell.

While attempting to hide from the world for a few minutes at lunchtime today, I found myself reading a few of the blogs I have followed for years. While reading I realised how lazy I have become. It's easy to blame my laziness on microbloggingon Twitter and Tumblron their predilection for short snippets of thought. Indeed; for the past several weeks I had redirected this blog to Tumblr because I didn't have time to write. And there we have the reasontime.

Saying "we do not have time" is the easiest excuse in the world. Of course we have timewe can make time. How many hours do we spend each week watching television, listening to the radio, or any number of other things that are not essential?Making time doesn't necessarily mean we will be able to conjure words when we sit down to write though I'm a fine example; I've sat here for the last few minutes pondering on what I might write, and have been distracted by the television, my better half, and any number of other things.

So what we really need is time, and minimal distractions. You would think, given the ambient noise in our house approaching jet engine testing laboratory levels, that I would be able to put up with hilarious levels of distraction. You would normally be right. While writing about something, I could probably ignore the house falling down around me, but if I'm sat here daydreaming, anything and everything will distract me.

Perhaps my chief skilland one that has not diminished while not bloggingis the ability to write copious quantities of verbiage about nothing at all. This post is a testament to that.

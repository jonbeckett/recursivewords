The great idea about monkeying with my phone to try and free some memory up was half successful. It worked, but it didn't do what I hoped it would.

The applications have still installed on the internal memory of the phone, but the default location for data has been set to external memory. In effect this means I'm back where I startedwith a really great phone that is crippled by the amount of internal memory, meaning I can't install all the apps I want on it.

I'm almost thinking about going back to an iPhone, except of course I would have to buy a handset, which would cost about the same as a small aircraft.

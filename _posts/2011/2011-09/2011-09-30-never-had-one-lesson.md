If you're wondering where the total came from, it's from "Ferris Bueller's Day Off"one of the iconic coming of age movies from the mid 80s. I've got news for Mr Buellerhe's got nothing on our daughterYesterday evening while I was finishing up on some software development work in the study, our youngest wandered into the room, with a recorder attached to her mouth by both hands, fingers-a-blur, playing all manner of random notes.

She suddenly stopped, and pulled it from her mouth"This how they do it at Recorder Club"She immediately continues her high speed recital"Do you go to recorder club at school now?"Without missing a beat, and without removing the recorder from her mouth, she opens a corner of her mouth, and says "Nope".

Beat that Mr Bueller.

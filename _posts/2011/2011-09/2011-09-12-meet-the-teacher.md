Late this afternoon at work the phone on my desk rang. I picked it up"Hi" (it was W)"Yeeeees""Umm I completely forgot it's Meet the Teacher at school this eveningcould you leave work a bit early and meet me down there?""I suppose so""What time?""In about half an hour?"I then closed my machine down, packed my bag, and trundled off across town to the junior schooloff to "Meet the Teacher(s)". After minding my own business in the playground for a few moments, a certain little seven year old came tearing round the corner shouting "Hi Dad!", and then continued eating the half a bag of crisps in her hand. You never see marathon runners do that.

Presently the rest of our gang arrived, and myself and W were lead by huge smiles to meet Miss Ten, and Miss Seven's teachers. I can't describe the enormous smile that remained on Little Miss Seven's face as she showed me her classroom, her chair, her desk, her tray, her pencil case, her coat peg, and anything else she could think of as she marched back and forth. Huge pride.

Miss Ten was a little more understated. We know she loves her new teacher (a male teacher! a rare thing indeed!). He is by turns charming, relaxed, gracious, funny, and of course wonderful with the children. It's not hard to see how every little girl in his class will have already built a huge pedestal to put him on.

All too soon we were back in the playground, and wandering back towards home. Thoughts soon turned to "what's for dinner?", and "can I buy some chocolate from the shop?"..

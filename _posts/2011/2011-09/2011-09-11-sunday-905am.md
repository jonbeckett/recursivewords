Story of the morning so far;Woke up to a little blonde person sliding into bed between myself and W, and two cats curled up at my feetFinally got up, had shower, let chickens out, fed cats, put dishwasher on (forgot last night), and made coffeeListened to screaming match upstairs as W completely lost it with the children who were bickering incessantly as only small children can.

Now hiding in the lounge, with Kate Rusby playing on the stereohopefully some quiet folk music will calm everybody down.

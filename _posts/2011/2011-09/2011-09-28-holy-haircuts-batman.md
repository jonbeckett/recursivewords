After the usual struggle to get the children up and out of the house this morning, and histrionics from Little Miss Seven about her having a cold (you would have thought she was the only person that has ever had a cold in the history of humanity), we set out to their respective schools.

The kids knew I was getting my hair cut, so in an attempt to take Miss Seven's mind off her near-death condition, I courted suggestions for my impending haircut."Shall I have it all cut off, like Kojak?""Who's Kojak?"Good point. They never re-show it either, do they. Kojak is now a dim recollection from the early 1970s, and my formative years. Saying "who loves you baby?" with a lollipop in your mouth only raises a smile from people 35 or older"How about I have orange and yellow stripes like the cats?""Yesstating to anybody within vocal range (and her vocal range is pretty spectacular)that I was having all my hair cut off, and an orange striped head.

After dropping the kids off, and waving to the various parents I have come to know, I headed off to "Geezers".

In the daytime, Geezers is staffed by toothsome young strumpetsa blatant marketing initiative to attract men in to get their hair cut, and to go blind. Unfortunately I'm never there in the daytime Arriving at the instant they open on a morning generally means I get the owner cutting my hair, and an earful of how annoyed she is with the younger members of staff never turning up on time.

Perhaps next time I'll leave work at lunchtime to get my hair cut. Or take my life in my hands and visit the Sweeney Todd style barbers in Station Road. It turns out this other school Dad I met this morning goes there, and he hasn't had his throat cut yet. I have a feeling it's a "one style shop" though; short back and sides, or nothing just like the barbers I used to go to as a childnot that it would make any difference; I haven't had my hair cut any differently than this in years.

I've had long hair before. I'm not doing it again. Quite apart from the quantities of shampoo and conditioner I went through each week, it means getting up at least ten minutes earlier to look after it. Sod that.

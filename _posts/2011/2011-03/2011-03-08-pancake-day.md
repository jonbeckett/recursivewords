Guess who found himself walking to the corner shop at 7:15am this morning to buy eggs, and guess who's other half was making pancakes at 7:30am.You're probably wondering why we were making pancakes so early in the morning on Pancake Day...

I got in from work last night and was informed rather loudly, and repeatedly by Little Miss Seven that she would not be requiring breakfast services in the morning because she was having breakfast at school.

"Are you?"

"Yes. We are having PANCAKES 

This introduces a problem. The school was doing a pancake breakfast fund-raiser, but our eldest has a gluten free diet (she's Coeliac). This meant we needed to make pancakes for her to take with her. No problem - we thought we would just make some gluten free pancakes before going to bed, and put them in the fridge for the morning.

What we didn't think about was the changing list of foods the younger children will or wont eat at the moment. We ended up having various combinations of chips, beans, and egg for dinner last night in order for everybody to have something fairly similar. Can you see where this is going yet?

W headed off towards the kitchen I had just cleaned up at about 11pm last night, looked in the fridge, and shouted

"OH CRAP"

"What's wrong?"

"I used all the eggs earlier"

I glanced at my watch...

"It's already 11pm - even the garage shop is probably shut... I'll have to go get some first thing"

And that's how I ended up swapping smalltalk with the little grey haired lady in the corner shop this morning at 7:15am.

No doubt this evening will see the kids arguing over the number, size, and composition of their pancakes by the time I get home. Oh the memories... "how many has he had?", "can I have another one?", "it's not fair", "can we have them tomorrow too?"...

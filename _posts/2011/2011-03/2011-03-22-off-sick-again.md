Lunchtime

I'm sat at home, in the relative quiet of the living room. I came home from work early after medication for the wicked cold I have (the third in a row if my counting is anything like accurate) made me deaf as a post, and not much better.

The quiet will come to an abrupt end when the children come home from school later this afternoon in much the same way as the silence ends when a piano hits the floor after whistling past several storys of a tall building.

Evening

After clearing the umpteenth load of dishes through the dishwasher, and tidying the kitchen up, I have surrendered and gone to bed.

Hoping against hope that this isn't flu. It seems like it. The entire time I was clearing up the kitchen, I was shivering violently. I don't have a blocked nose.

A friend asked me a fascinating question earlier today - if you had an unlimited budget, and no ties, where would you like to go - what destinations would you choose?

I responded immediately, and received a number of exclamation and question marks in response - here's why : my list;

Simple. I'm not choosing destinations - I'm choosing friends - some close by, some far away. Close friends, old friends, new friends, departed friends, and far flung friends. Perhaps it says a lot about me.What would be the point of being able to travel the world freely, without your first ports of call being the various friends you have made? Sure, I would like to visit Machu Picchu, Roraima, Angkor Wat, the Pyramids, and lots of other places - but beyond reading the books and gazing at the views, experiencing them alone would seem to be tremendously hollow.

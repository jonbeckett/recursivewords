This morning happened just like any other morning. Literally. Got up, shower, dressed, hit the kitchen for breakfasts, lunches, washing up, then brushing kids hair, ordering the finding of shoes and coats, and the scrabble to get out the door on time.

I wondered if anybody would remember, and nobody did.

It was my Birthday today.

En-route to the office, I partook in the ancient tradition (well... in our office anyway) of buying goodies for your co-workers. I chose biscuits for everybody - which of course didn't stop somebody mentioning that standards were falling in the absence of cakes.

Arriving home this evening, I wondered if the penny might have dropped during the day, and it had. Somebody had been shopping on their way home from work and bought pizza, wine, and a box of Cadburys Roses. There was also a far more obvious clue; the little blonde girl who sprinted from the house, shouting "Happy Birthday Dad!" at the top of her voice as she ran after me.

"You all forgot, didn't you"

"Yes"

"Never mind"

"You have to come in - we have a surprise"

After putting my bike away and checking on the chickens, I wandered back indoors, and was greeted by W with the phone "It's your Mum"... while hearing birthday messages from my Mum, Little Miss Seven walked into the room, and pretty much told me exactly what I had for my birthday. She is without a doubt the worst keeper of secrets in the known universe. The most memorable moment was probably a couple of years ago when she marched through the house and told me not to go in the kitchen because they were making a cake for me, and it was a secret.

"It's not a secret now, is it."

"Oh."

At about 8:30pm our eldest arrived home from Brownies and rushed off to her room to find the item pictured - "HAPPY birthdAY DAD" written in Hamma beads.

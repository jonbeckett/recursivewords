While buried in programming code at my desk, I tend to lose myself. Before I know it, I've forgotten to eat lunch, or not even got up from my desk for hours. There have been days when I have got up to go home and suddenly realised it's been raining... all day.

Such was the back-story for lunchtime today. After making something work (a rare event, probably worth celebrating), I kicked my office chair away from the desk, and swung around just as a colleague walked into the room.

"It's gorgeous outside!"

It was. We all looked up, and realised he was right.

"Who fancies going for a walk?"

One by one we all agreed, and tried to finish whatever tremendously important thing we were doing such that we might stand half a chance of picking it up again a little later. Then we did something software developers almost never do... we went outside - you know - in the fresh air.

We need to do it more often.

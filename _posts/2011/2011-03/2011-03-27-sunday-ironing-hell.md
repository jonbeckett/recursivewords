What wasI thinking of last night when I told W that I would do the ironing today? After six hours of ironing, the washing machine and dryer still going, and the washing line outside still being loaded to breaking point, I'm starting to question my own sanity.

It probably didn't help that I got up at 6am to watch the Formula One coverage from Australia. Given that the clocks went forward this morning (something else I looked after before everybody else got up), I actuallygot up at 5am.

Yes, I am an idiot.

Goodbye Sunday - it was nice not really knowing you. Only a few hours, and it will be Monday again, back at work, and "looking forward" to next weekend - where I will haveno weekend again - you know - just like last weekend.

In other news, the friendship between our eldest and "Little Miss Tall with Dark Hair" (I really must think up a name for her) is showing no signs of slowing down just yet. They have been talking non-stop since they met this morning - either in our garden, the playpark, her garden, on their bikes, on skates...

They just appeared at the back door...

"Dad, can we have, like, a snacky picnic?"

"No."

Yes, I am horrible. I'm now listening for the inevitable sneaky attempts to take food out of the house. Thinking about it, the only interactions I've had with Miss 10 today have been her asking for things. I'm guessing this will be the pattern for the next 20 years...

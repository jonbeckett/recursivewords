It's been a while since I've done this kind of blog post, but in the absence of anything more interesting to share this morning, here you go...

What kind of car do you drive?

I don't. I ride a mountain bike to and from work, and commute to work destinations by train. W has the car, and occasionally uses it to ferry the children to school - although invariably we all try and walk to and from school too (it's only 15 minutes walk away).

What are your best physical features?

Difficult one to answer, because I don't really look at myself that often. To others who might judge, probably my legs. All the miles on the bike have had an effect... I've been told my hands are "artists hands", whatever that means.

What are your best characteristics?

Even more difficult to answerwith a few of the children I went to school with there, but haven't been back in perhaps 10 years.

How far away from your birthplace do you live now?

About an hour's drive. We live in Marlow, in Buckinghamshire. When I first moved here it took some getting used to; the number of people here either with money, or wanting to be seen to have money was quite a shock. I guess the clue should have been the array of restaurants, and boutiques for ladies of a certain age.

What are you reading now?

I'm supposed to be reading "Generation A" by Douglas Coupland, but haven't even got around to starting it yet. I bought myself a Kindle for Christmas last year, hoping it would push me back into reading more regularly. I really need to do something about that...

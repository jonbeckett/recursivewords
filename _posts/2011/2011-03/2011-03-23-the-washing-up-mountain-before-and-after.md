While I often write about my hatred of washing up, while stood contemplating the task at hand this evening, it occurred to me that my phone was in my pocket, and it has a pretty good camera on it...

This, ladies and gentlemen, is the before and after of a typical evening washing-up mountain in the Beckett Household. If you're wondering what might cause such a heap, I have one thing to say : Spaghetti Bolognese. It doesn't mean much on it's own, but when you figure in a vegetarian, and a coeliac among the five of us, it amounts to two of everything - meat free bolognese, regular bolognese, gluten free pasta, and regular pasta.

It generally takes me about half an hour if not "assisted" by little people. Their help could easily double it, and then you also have to deal with breakages, changes of clothes, cleaning of icky hands, brushing of gravy out of hair, and so on.

And you think I'm joking...

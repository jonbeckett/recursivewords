I sat at work yesterday, thunking my way through a pretty complex pile of javascript, jQuery, webservices, and server side code, and the day vanished in front of my eyes.

I remember realising it was lunchtime. I looked at my screen, realised I could get something working if I kept going, and before I knew it I hadn't stopped at all throughout the day - one inch forward with the software led to another, and another. Sure, I gained significant ground in terms of the project, but I went home pretty tired - which wasn't the best idea, given that we had plans to go out.

Between the moment I walked in the door at 6pm, and the moment we walked back out the door at 7:45pm, I somehow managed to wash up, tidy the kitchen, shut the chickens in for the night, tidy the lounge (a bit), load the dishwasher, carry clothes to their destination bedrooms, have a shower, have a shave, and get dressed.

I remember sitting in the pub with our friends at one point, thinking I should be much happier about being out - and yet I wasn't - I was just tired.

It's the same story today - up at 8:30ish, made the children their breakfasts, washed up again, tidied the kitchen again, let the chickens out, cleaned the chicken run out, received the grocery delivery, took our youngest into town with me to buy medicine for Wend (suspectedtonsillitis), pick her contact lens prescription up, and buy a birthday card for our friend's son. Immediately after getting home I made lunch for everybody, and then tidied everything away after.

As I write this sentence, W has just returned from dropping the kids at a school fund raiser (a fashion show!) - meaning my free time just came to an end.

Off to make her a cup of tea... or I would if I didn't get shouted at for not sounding enthusiastic about throwing my entire afternoon away taking photos at the school event...

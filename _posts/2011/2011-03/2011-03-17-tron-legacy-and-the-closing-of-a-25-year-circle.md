I finally got around to watching Tron Legacy last night. All I can say is wow. It's probably worth explaining that I was always going to be biased towards it - I was part of the generation that grew up with the original movie.

At about 11 years old I remember standing in noise filled darkened rooms, wishing I had another coin to play the games at the amusement arcade. I remember visiting the local funfair and spending my entire time either playing, or watching others play games - not once exploring the rides, shooting galleries, or other detritus.

I remember the first program I ever saw written - by a friend of my brother. It asked which planet you wanted to destroy, you entered it's name, and it counted down before announcing it had been destroyed. Total and utter black magic to a young and impressionable mind. I remember writing the listing of the program out, and not being able to make head or tail of it.

Moving forward a few years, I remember writing my first "proper" applications. I threw planetary bodies around the screen - first in two dimensions, and then in three. I remember the math lecturer taking one look and telling me I should have studied physics. I remember being in awe of a fellow student and close friend who could write assembly language.

From this background - continued over 25 years - I sat last night and watched Tron Legacy, and was enthralled. So many moments to remember... when Flynn re-entered the grid to save his son... when Gem accompanied Sam to meet Zuse... when Cora saw her first sunrise...

I can't remember a movie having this much effect on me in years.

Tonight was needed. A night away from doing anything, after days - weeks even - of thinking I should be somewhere else, doing something else.

I find "doing nothing" extremely hard.

We have all this stuff. TV, DVD player, satellite TV, Nintendo Wii, books, movies, musical instruments, board games, and so on.

And what am I doing?

Watching garbage television. A documentary about the years the actor Neil Morrissey spent in care homes, and now "Never Mind the Buzzcocks" - probably the best music quiz show on television.

Noel Fielding rules.

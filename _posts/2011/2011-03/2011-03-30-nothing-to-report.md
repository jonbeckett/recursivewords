I wish I had something more interesting to report than "life is going on". Close friends have probably gathered as much by my absence from the social networks. Work is pretty consuming at the moment, and following being sick for weeks, I'm wiped out when I get home.

I'm sat here writing this when I know I should be getting the children to bed - but following their stunt this morning (they got out of bed at 3am and started playing in their room), I'm inclined to let them stay up a bit - see if it makes any difference at all.

The photo on this post was taken at dinner this evening. Yes, the children are mad. Little Miss Seven would have been in the shot too, had she not been stuffing her face with choc-ice (in reality it looked more like she was painting her face with it).

I can't believe tomorrow is Thursday already.

This weekend sees our eldest attending a bicycle training course at her school. We were up bright and early, making her a packed lunch, finding her warm clothes (it's freezing outside), and digging out her helmet, reflective tabard, and gloves. I pulled her bike from the shed, made sure everything was working, oiled it, and lubed the chain.

All set!

Riding a bike is one of the first things we have taught the children - our eldest came to us when she was 7 years old, and had never owned a bike, or even played in a playpark. The first few months were essentially a full-on assault as we threw her at new things. Victory after victory piled up. I can still remember the moment she cracked the bike, and stopped in shock to turn and shout;

"Did you see me!? Did you see me!?"

There was a woman walking along the road who also saw it, and couldn't help grinning from ear to ear too. It's such a privilage to be involved in their young lives when they make each leap.

We arrived at the school playground this morning a few minutes early, and discovered we were nearly last to arrive. Young boys were riding bikes around far too big for them, skidding, and basically doing their best to annoy. I noticed one of the instructors silently shaking his head. I'm guessing he knows too - the bravado will vanish as soon as they are on the road later this afternoon.

I couldn't help noticing thatbrand new bikes were out in force. Of all the children present, perhaps 80% of them were being ridden for the first time. I looked around the bottom brackets and hubs (always a tell tale), and they were spotless. The rims of the bikes with normal brakes gave away that they had never been ridden.

I was also surprised how big a lot of the children's bikes were. Given that you're supposed to feel like you're controlling the bike, and not just a passenger perched on top of it, I struggle to see how young children can have control over something so big and heavy.

I'm actually quite proud to write that our kids bikes have been ridden (almost) to destruction. The younger children ride theirs to school and back almost every day, and our eldest often takes hers to the playpark - when not roller skating, or scootering. Oh the transport decisions of children...

It will be interesting to go out with Little Miss 10 later and follow her on the road - see what she has learned. I have deliberately not taught her much beyond road positioning because I wanted her to be good at riding the bike before worrying about traffic.

It's going to be fun.

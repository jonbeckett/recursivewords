It sounds too good to be true, doesn't it - a chance to visit a brewery and drink free beer all evening. And yet that's exactly what I did last night with my brother in law.

I count myself as incredibly fortunate to live just down the road from the Rebellion Brewery, which is based on a farm on the outskirts of Marlow. They run a "membership club" that my brother in law is a member of, affording you the chance several times a year to visit for the evening with guests, and (within reason) drink as much as you like. The main idea is to go on a tour of the brewery, and/or try out the various beers available at the time. Last night we tried a couple of different beersand did the tour.

The only downer of the evening was the knowledge that I had to be up bright and early today for a trip into London for work. I had originally planned on only having a couple of pints, but that inevitably became three, and I pretty much regretted it all day. I've still not shaken this cold, and having alcohol swilling around my system seems to have let the cold have another go at me. Pretty annoying because I was hoping to maybe go for a run tomorrow evening.

It's now two and a half weeks since I last ran anywhere.

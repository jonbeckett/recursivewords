I awoke biefly at about 5:30 this morning, and found myself listening to something I've not heard so early in the morning for months.

Birdsong.

I craned my neck to look out of the window and saw the soft glow of early spring morning flooding the bedroom. I thought no more of it, and fell asleep until the new phone alarm burst into life at 7. It wasn't really needed - a certain little blonde girl had requested help with her school dress ten minutes previously.

Myself and Wend encouraged each other out of bed with promises of hot tea;

"if you go make a cup of tea, I'll get up"

"ok"

(I didn't move)

"Go on... get up. I'm always up first".

And so the morning went on. While it might be difficult to get out of bed sometimes, once I hit the ground it's basically a flat out run until the children are walking towards school. This morning I missed the walk to school with them on account of trying to do too many things at once and failing spectacularly.

Still. Spring is here. Time to smile, and feel refreshed, and full of ideas for the future... if I didn't still have this damn cold, and a snot factory substituting for the thing that used to be my nose.

I don't know if all guys work the same way as me, but I tend to keep using stuff until I'm out of virtually everything, then resupply. Today was resupply day.

In the order of the picture;

King of Shaves Kinexium Shave Serum

I discovered King of Shaves products a couple of years ago while trying to find a gel or oil that wouldn't tear my skin to shreds. They makeby far the bestshaving products for my skin.

Adidas Ice Dive Body Spray

In the spirit of trying new things out almost every time I buy bathroom products, I got a different deodorant than I've ever bought before (which isn't that hard to achieve, seeing as deodorants change every week anyway, as they try and sell you one of ten different smells in a thousand different ways) .

Adidas Ice Dive Shower Gel

There was a two-for-one offer on the Adidas stuff. That really is the only reason I picked it up.

Garnier Fructis Shampoo & Conditioner

Chosen because I'm a lazy so-and-so, and would rather use the combined shampoo and conditioners (my hair is short, it doesn't matter). I would normally get Elvive whatever-its-called, but they didn't have any... again, that product bias is based on me knowing the name of it; not that I know if it's any better or worse.

So there you go. The stuff I wash with. A bit less fancy than girls who shop at Crabtree and Evelyn, where girls who believe what they read in magazines buy goats milk, and powdered Rhino farts...

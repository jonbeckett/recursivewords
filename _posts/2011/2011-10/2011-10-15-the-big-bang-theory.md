I've never quite understood why my friends and colleagues are not hugefans of "The Big Bang Theory". It's the only television show I have made any effort to regularly watch over the last few years, to the extent that I download new episodes from the torrents (the bone headed television networks insist on making us wait for months before airing them over here).

I make no apologies for getting advance copies either; I will be watching the episodes again when they finally air here, and will probably buy the DVD set of the series too.

How can you watch this without laughing[youtube=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKVmrFyzIDA&w=640&h=390]

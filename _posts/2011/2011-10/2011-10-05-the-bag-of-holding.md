I've been sorting out the contents of the bag I carry aroundthinning it out a bit. I picked it up at the weekend as I left the house to travel to W's parents, and thought some freak gravity field was pulling on it or something.

The big loser from the process is the Filofax. I guess in many ways I was clinging onto it out of sentimentality. I love the written word (explained by the Moleskine notebook I guess), and having a written calendar seemed like such a good idea. Unfortunately for it (and the company that make them I guess), Google Calendar has made me incredibly lazy. I enter reminders on any computer, and my phone shouts at me when the time comes.

It just occurred to me that the new camera isn't in the photo because it was taken with it; it's a Fuji Finepix T200one of their entry level point-and-shoot cameras. It was cheap, the build quality is good, and it slides into a pocket. I've been getting more and more annoyed with the mobile phone camera being so slow to capture events as they unfoldby the time it's decided to focus on anything, you may as well have no bothered trying. Hopefully this little point and shoot camera will be a little better at it.

While sat eating lunch at work a couple of days the owner of the company walked through the office, and asked after the iPadI had spoken to him a few days before buying it, wondering about use cases. It turns out he had been through the exact same dilemma. It has no direct usebut it is veryconvenient for all manner of things. Chief among them so far has been watching missed television shows in bed.

I've been thinking twice about carrying the DSi around with me. I hardly ever play it any moreor any games any more to be honest.

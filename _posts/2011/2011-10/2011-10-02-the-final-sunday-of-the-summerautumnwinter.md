It's difficult to believe it's Octoberit's been bakingly hot all day. We had nothing planned for the day, and following the arrival of a friend's son at our door this morning talking about a "picnic", we thought "what the hell"We need to do this kind of thing moreand be more grateful for the place we live. We have this amazing green on our front doorstep, with shade trees, a playpark, and thick green grass stretching out in all directions.

These are the days we will remember for the rest of our lives.

I've always been fascinated by "pulp fiction" books, but have never read any.

I remember the place we used to rent VHS video tapes from years ago had lockable shelves outside that were opened in the summerheaving with thousands of trashy paperbacks. I never gave them a second glance back then, but these days I would probably find myself looking at the books ahead of the movies.

Most of the pulp fiction I've seen so far seems to date from the 1950s and 60s (judging from the commercial artwork on the covers). I'm guessing it all became far more commercial in the 1980s, when the likes of Jackie Collins became fashionable.

The only problem with finding any pulp fiction books these days seems to be that they are rare, meaning they command a high price. It's interesting reallyin their day they were read on beaches, and thrown away and yet now they fetch more than the latest releases.

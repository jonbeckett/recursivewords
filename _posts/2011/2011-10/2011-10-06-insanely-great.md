At some time after midnight last night I was checking twitter, and saw a post from Pete Cashmore at Mashable appear at the top of the stream"Steve Jobs has died". It was quickly followed by just about every major news network, and then signalled to the world via the Apple website.

I never thought it would affect me. I walked into the lounge to tell W and she was sat in the shadows, Macbook on her lap, watching late night TV."Apple have just released the news that Steve Jobs died""Oh no!"We just looked at each other for a few momentsSuddenly Twitter, Facebook, Google+, Tumblr, and the news networks were flooded with the news. Quotes, memories, and stories were flying in all directions.

This morning while setting out to work I plugged the iPod into my ears and listened to the team at Buzz Out Loud who had started recording not long after the news broke. Molly Wood opened the show with the news, and struggled to keep her composurethat really got to me.

Along the way to work I thought about what I might write here this morningwhat I might say. Was there anything worthwhile I could add at all? Probably not. I didn't know the guyI only knew ofhimin the same way that millions of others did. He was the guy standing next to the first Mac in 1984, grinning while the word "Macintosh" scolled past in a smoothly rendered serif typeface.

My abiding memory of Apple under Steve's watch will always be this Richard Dreyfuss voiced commercial[youtube=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE857DJWX2w&w=480&h=360]

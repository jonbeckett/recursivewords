I thought I was going to be online a lot over the next few days (while holed up in a country hotel) but the reality couldn't be further from the truth.

The wireless signal is pathetically weak, I lost most of the evening preparing demonstration materials for tomorrow, and dinner in the hotel somehow took two hours.

I know I'm just bellyaching because I'm away from home, so take no notice. I might have been in better spirits if there had been any vending machines in the hotelbut nothe only way of getting anything to eat or drink is from the bar or restaurant at rip off prices.

We could have stayed at a much smaller hotel right next to a huge supermarketbut no. We are at a strange country hotel out in the sticks, which is great if you're you're more interested in going out running or swimming than calling home, or working.

Like I saidtake no notice of me.

I'm sat on the bed in the room with the iPad. For some reason it's wireless signal is much better than the work laptop. Spandau Ballet are playing on the radio"Through the Barricades". Great song.

Dinner this evening was posh country club restaurant chicken and chips. This means the chicken comes out in a stupid little wok, and you get 5 chips. Pudding was chocolate something or other (I forget the exact name)basically chocolate ice cream, some fudge, and half a mouthful of chocolate milkshake.

I would have been far happier with food from the supermarket

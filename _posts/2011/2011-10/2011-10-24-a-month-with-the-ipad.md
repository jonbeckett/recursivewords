In the spirit of doing things backwards, I bought myself an iPad last month before I really knew why I might ever need one. I think this is true of most people who have tablet devices; there is no real "need" or "use case" for them - they are just convenient. There have been a few "wins" with it - some expected, some unexpected; NoteShelf I never thought I might use the iPad as a notebook, but I have, and it works brilliantly. I bought a Griffin stylus for it, which lets you write on the screen much as you would with a pen. It took a couple of tries before I found a scribbling app I like (NoteShelf), but once found, I was away and running. It has caused no end of interest in conference calls at work, where I have written pages of notes, and sent myself the PDF at the end. FlipBoard I had read about FlipBoard in the past, and wasn't dissappointed in it at all. It turns the leading social media sites (Twitter, Facebook, etc) into a magazine for you to flip through. If you've never seen it, it could easily sell the iPad on the spot for most people. Television in Bed Who knew that the BBC iPlayer would become a staple of late night television viewing in bed?

The universe finally seems to be tilting back in my favour. Multiple work projects are being delivered in multiple directionsI am a virtual Shiva today (well the many handed part works well, but the "destroyer" part doesn't quite).

It feels more like Wednesday than Tuesday, and I'm not entirely sure why.

Having the last couple of hours of the day to myself means I finally get the chance to take a step back and tidy things up somewhat.

It struck me this morning the reason I was so stressed yesterday was because I imagine others expectations of me being far higher than they really are. I don't like to let people down, and it often turns into an albatross of sorts. I am relied on by coworkers to be the safe pair of handsthe dependable guy that will hit the deadline, even if it means lifting the world on his shoulders.

I need to stop saying "I'm fine" when people ask how I'm doing.

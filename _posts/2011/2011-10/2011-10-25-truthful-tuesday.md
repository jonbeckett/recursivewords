It's been a while since I've participated in the "Truthful Tuesday" meme, and to be honest I can't remember what I've written about in the past. Here goes I never really "fitted in" when I was a kid, and still don't feel like I do as an adult. I was shy, and always the gawky kid that seemed to be on the outside of anything going on. I'm partially red green colourblind " the muddy shades between green and brown get me, and purpley blues get me (I can't figure out if they are one colour or the other). My visual acuity used to be over 20/20. I suspect it's not so good any more (everybody's eyes get worse as they get older). I haven't had an eye test for a couple of years, so should probably sort that out. I had a dream last night that I had lost my birth certificate, and without it we couldn't have children. I then woke up, and while trying to figure the crazy dream out, remembered the receipt for the iPad was still in the top pocket of my fleece go figure.

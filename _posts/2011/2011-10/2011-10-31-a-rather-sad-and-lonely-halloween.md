While the children were out having fun this eveningdressed up as various ghouls, caked in face paint, and draped in hilariously camp fancy dress costumes, I sat in a restaurant with my manager, several hours from home after sitting in a far flung office all day. I'm now sat in a pokey guest house room.

It's worth pointing out that the guest house cost more than the hotel last week, it's smaller, and it's stuck up beyond belief. When I was first showed to my room I thought it was great. There on the tray was what looked like a complimentary small bottle of wine, some packets of crisps, peanuts, and various other bits and bobs. Luckily I spotted the price list before I drank or ate anything. I know I'm not used to buying wine in restaurants, but I'm not paying the same amount for one glass that buys a whole bottle of quite reasonable wine from a shop.

If I wasn't here with a co-worker I would have walked to a nearby store and bought food and drink to bring back with me. I've done it before.

Just before leaving the office this evening the following conversation happened;"Are your children doing anything tonight?""Yes, they all have costumes and face makeup, and are going trick or treating around all of our friends houses. We were all invited to a party by a good friend."There was a pregnant pause"You've made me feel really awful now".

I didn't say anything in response.

At the end of the day work is workit pays our bills, and I'm good at what I do (as evidenced by a very good reaction to the demo of what I have been working on earlier). It doesn't make it any easier when you are forced to miss one of the important memories in your children's lives though. Apparently at the party I was the only one of our circle of friends missing.

I just rule sometimes (not)

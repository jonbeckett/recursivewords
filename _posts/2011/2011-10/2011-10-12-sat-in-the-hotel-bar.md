This evening I'm sat in the foyer of the hotel with a glass of cider, killing time until my colleague appears a little later for a meal in the restaurant.

When I arrived a few minutes ago, two guys in their late 50s were discussing sex at the end of the barloudly enough that I could hear them from quite some distance away. One was explaining to the other the misogynistic view that only one pair of stockings exists in the university (work the rest of the story out for yourself).

I glanced up at the two men, and noticed that neither of them had wedding rings on their fingers. So they were both Casanova in their own mind. I try not to prejudge people, but sometimes they make it incredibly difficult.

A blonde girl walked into the bar a few minutes ago and started flapping the opening of her shirt to fan air onto her chest See what I mean about the struggles in prejudging people?This hotel is odd. It's out of town, has a pool, a gym, and no doubt lots of other facilities but I have only seen businessmen "of a certain age" using the facilities I am accompanied in the bar by people similar to myselfa couple of twenty or thirty-something guys, and a couple of twenty something girls, each of us sat on our own.

There's one fat bald guy sat at the bar, eating at the bar. I can't figure that out eitherit looks really awkward. Maybe he's doing that so he can watch the TV (alongside the bar) Perhaps he has bad eyes?The television is running with subtitles, and the bar is being flooded with some no name easy going band. Their music is pretty soporific, but I guess it's better than nothing.

Anyway My coworker will appear soon. I better finish writing this and fold the iPad up.

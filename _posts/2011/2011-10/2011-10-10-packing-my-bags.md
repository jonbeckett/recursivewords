This evening I'm packing my bags to head away for a few days with work. I'll be back on Thursday night. Although this sounds ridiculous, I can't say on a public forum where I'm going or what I'm going to be doing because of the various professional restrictions surrounding it.

In no particular order; Clothes are packed Work shoes are polished Passport is found, valid, and packed iPad is on charge Kindle is on charge Work laptop and charger are in the backpack Movies are busy copying to my external hard driveI still need to; Pack a wash bagExpect me to be online a lot over the next couple of evenings.

After spending a much of 2007 and 2008 commuting into the city each day, and the latter part of 2009 working away Monday through Thursday each week, preparing to "be away" feels strangely like getting back on a bike.

The children are completely fine with it. W isn't because she knows she will be single handed for a few daysneither of our parents live nearby, so help is always an hour or more away.

Roll on 6am tomorrow, when I'll roll out of bed and hit the ground running.

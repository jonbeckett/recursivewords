Little Miss Seven and I set out for the Apple Store in nearby Reading this morning to (hopefully) get the iPad replaced, after it was suddenly struck down with a severe case of dead pixels last week. See the full gallery on Posterous The Apple Store staff were great. Upon arrival I spoke to one of the blue shirted army, who immediately looked for a genius bar appointment for me. Tomorrow. Not good. "It takes me an hour to get here. It may be another week before I can come again - can't you do something right here and now?" "Hang on, I need to check with my manager..." The young guy I had been speaking to parked me at one of the "customer setup" desks, and returned with a taller, older version of himself. Immediate swap of iPad agreed, and another minion instructed to go fetch. Five minutes later I had a new iPad, a new receipt for it, and had to prise Little Miss Seven away from the ranks of "helpfully placed" iMacs, where she was busy playing "The Cat in the Hat". I have now been in Apple Stores twice in my life, and both times the customer service has been stellar.

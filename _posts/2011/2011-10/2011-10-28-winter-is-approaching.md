En-route to work this morning on the mountain bike, I came stopped, pulled the phone from my pocket, and took the following photo.It looked a lot more impressive in reality, and I was kicking myself that I didn't have the point and shoot camera with me.

In other news, it's finally the weekend, and I'm wondering what on earth happened to the last week. For some reason it feels like Wednesday, but of course it's notit's Friday.

How did that happen?Tomorrow morning W is leaving early to travel down to the south coast with her Mum, who is running in the "Great South Run", and I am dragging the kids down to the local football fields, where our eldest has football practice. While we're waiting for her we'll probably go for a wander into town. While the younger children play in the playpark I'll camp out at the caf with the kindle and a cup of tea.

I'm trying to spend a bit more time with the kids this weekend because I'll be away most of next week with work.

Must remember to take change for the caf.

Now if you'll excuse me, I have the latest episode of "The Big Bang Theory" to go and watch

Late last night it occurred to me that since my personal blog was sat on a subdomain of a domain I own, it wouldn't really matter if I replaced the underlying platform - say, from a self-hosted copy of wordpress to an instance at wordpress.com. You might ask why, and that would be a good question. You see, at wordpress.com there is an aggregated set of all the blogs existent at wordpress.com, meaning your writing is discovered far more readily than a self hosted blog. It's the equivalent of being on the street corner of a busy road, rather than behind a tree, ten miles out of town. I got my side of the masterplan working perfectly. I lifted all 9 years worth of my blog into the air, and gently set it down in it's new surroundings. I then made a test post, tagged purposely with odd taggs (things like "Zaphod Beeblebrox"), in order to then look in the directory of recent posts. Nothing. Nada. I then created a newblog at wordpress.com, and posted something else equally random. Immediate success. It would appear my 9 years worth of verbiage is enough to breakthe mighty system at WordPress. I should be employed by the blog platforms as some kind of stress testing idiot savant or something. Needless to say, this evening I have re-created blog.jonbeckett.com in it's own image, in such perfect detail that a casual visitor would never know it had been torn asunder... because, well I'm good at that sort of thing.

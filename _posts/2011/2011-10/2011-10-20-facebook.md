I don't understand the big problem so many people seem to have with Facebook. I think people's main objection is that they started out as a closed system, and have become increasingly open. Those same people also forget that they are not paying for the service Facebook provides, and that they have agreed to their terms and conditions (ergo : if they don't like it, they are free to leave). A few days after the news ticker made it's debut, I saw a flurry of public updates from acquaintances, requesting anybody who knew them click this, select that, or change the other to make their posts appear how they wished.I didn't do it.Instead, I reminded them of a simple truth; If you don't want something seen on the internet, don't post it on the internet. It really is that simple.

We saw the girls for perhaps an hour all dayspread across breakfast, lunch, and dinner time. We seem to have won the battle in terms of encouraging "outside" over video games or television. I'm guessing at some point it will come back to bite us in the backside when we want them to do their homework, but for the moment I suspect they are learning far more out there than they would watching TV.

Throughout the afternoon one or other of them would knock on the door, and present a high speed case for the prosecution on why somebody or other should be told off because they did something disasterousyou know, like "be mean to me". The stock answer of "I didn't see it, so I can't do anything" still hasn't sunk in.

Midway through the afternoon I wandered over to see how they were all getting on, and took the photo above. Of course my arrival prompted instant superstar status, and my own little fan club. I'm not sure why, but not many parents seem to wander over to the park just for fun.

While there, I became aware that another parent was sat on the bench behind me, but didn't really pay any attention. It did strike me afterwards that I might have informed one of our daughters friends differently that "we can almost see your bits and pieces" as she dangled upside down on the monkey bars.

As I left to go home and make a cup of tea, I glanced sideways and finally saw the other parent sat quietly behind mea stunning young woman in shades, reading a paperback book. I think she was smiling.

While walking back to the house I couldn't help grinningfor how many generations have little girls hung upside down in playparks, accidentally showing their days of the week underpants to the world ?

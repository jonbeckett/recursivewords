The above books have been sat on the shelf now for well over a year, and are getting no closer to being read. They sit there, looking great, looking interesting, but not finding their way into my hands.

The real problem isn't me picking the books up. The problem is time. Time to sit, quietly, and read. It just doesn't happen around here.

Take yesterday for example. Angry words were exchanged in the early afternoon when I got the first proper chance of the day to sit down and check my email, read tumblr, facebook, and so on - and immediately upon doing so a certain little girl came round the corner asking to go roller skating. My other half appeared behind her.

"You did promise her earlier"

"I know" I hit the power button on the monitor, stood up, and started walking from the room.

"Don't be like that!"

I shook my head, grabbed my coat, and followed her out of the door.

I didn't get another chance to do anything until late afternoon, while keeping an eye on our eldest, who was supposedto be doing her school project. The next opportunity came at midnight.

I'm writing this during a few minutes to myself, which are abruptly coming to an end. Lunchtime. Then washing up. Then taking the kids out.

And now I have a tantrum to deal with.

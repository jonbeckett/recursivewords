It was predictable really, wasn't it. Given a few days off work, what happens? A new theme for Tumblr is what happens...

I have something of a love/hate relationship with Tumblr - while it's often unstable, and the administrative interface isn't perhaps the most intuitive in the world, the community is probably the best of the big social networks... and with the demise of services such as Vox, Yahoo 360, and so many others, it more or less stands alone as a community of bloggers.

The theme was built from the ground up in about 24 hours, and has been submitted to Tumblr for inclusion in their "Theme Garden" - where thousands of people will discover it, use it, and make me internationally famous (yeah, right).

If you would like a "hands-on" with the new theme, head over to my tumblog, which resides at the following URL -

I think it might be time for a cup of tea now...

I've written about my search for the inspiring, the interesting, the original, and the (probably) insane enough recently; time to share the results of the past few days;

The above people are the tip of a somewhat secret iceberg. If Tumblr had better discovery tools, it wouldn't take as much effort to find such awesome bloggers.

I noticed while writing this post that the demographic of people who share the most interesting (read:personal) stories on the net tends to be massively skewed towards women. Who knew I was such a rare commodity?!

p.s. I tried to format this post into columns, but Tumblr does it's level best to strip the HTML tags sorry!

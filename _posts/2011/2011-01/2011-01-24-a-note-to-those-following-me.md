Over the past few weeks - since I started dumping my ever inconsequential thoughts into Tumblr - a strange thing has happened. People have started following me - not in the real world - in Tumblr.

I have no idea why anybody would find my idiotic thoughts, ideas and opinions interesting enough to warrant being followed, but I'm going to say a huge thankyou anyway.

In a world where I'm regularly found headbutting my desk while Visual Studio reminds me that, yes, I am an idiot, it raises the sprits somewhat when I notice the light on the corner of the mobile phone blinking, and discover that some mystery person halfway around the world deems me interesting.

If you ARE one of the amazing, clever, lovely, interesting, wise, articulate, gorgeously stunning people following me, I need to perhaps explain why I might not be following you back.

Reblogs.

While I don't hate them per-se, I like to find out what the people I follow have been up to in my Tumblr dashboard. If all you're going to do is reblog pictures of kittens, sunsets, children, lingerie, or naked ladies, I'm probably not going to follow you (notice I said probably there) - purely because you will pollute the good stuff - the things people are thinking, and sharing.

It doesn't mean I won't find your stuff though; I have a folder in Google Chrome on the bookmark bar titled "Awesome Tumblrs", filled with all the great stuff I want to be able to browse, but don't want in the dashboard.

Am I making any sense?

Probably not, but there it is.

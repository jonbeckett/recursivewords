10 random questions, garnered from the vast stockpile that I once discovered online, and answered for your interest and amusement

What time is bed time? Usually somewhere between midnight and 1am. I've been known to stay up ridiculously late while tinkering with anything that interests me - I often lose track of time and do stupid things like forget to eat.

Have you ever been in a beauty pageant? Ahem nope. I'm guessing this question is usually targetted at women? I did dress as a woman for charity once. Main memory was that makeup has a really strong smell

How many tattoos do you have? None.

If you don't have any, have you ever thought of getting one? No - mainly because I know how often I change my mind about things, and would realise the importance of choosing something to stand the test of time - which would make the choice virtually impossible.

What did you do for your last birthday? Had a dinner of my choice - I chose sausage, chips and beans because I knew the children would eat it.

Do you carry a donor card? Yes. I filed the proper paperwork with them too - meaning as much of me as possible will go to medical science should anything awful happen to me.

Who was the last person you ate dinner with? My better half, and our children this evening. A celebration of sorts - my other half completed her first day back at work after three years off since we have had the kids.

Is the glass half empty or half full? I'm going to be a smart ass. Technically, the glass is neither half empty or half full - it contains 50% of it's maximum capacity.

What's the farthest-away place you've been? San Francisco, visiting my mad cousin who lives there, and runs the amazing Bettys Organics produce delivery company.

When's the last time you ate a homegrown tomato? Last summer - we grew them in the garden.

Candid enough for you?

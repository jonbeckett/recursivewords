Seriously... has anybody seen my weekend anywhere? I'm sure it was due to arrive at the end of Friday. I checked the doormat. I even checked down the side of the house - to see if it had been left anywhere. I wonder if any of the neighbours has it?

It only seems like a few hours since it was Friday night, and the whole weekend was stretched out ahead of me like a grand, lush vista, filled with opportunity. It's now Monday afternoon. That's all I have to say about that.

But of course, I have much more to say really. I don't do flippant very well, do I. The truth about the weekend is pretty much summed up by the photos below...

Let's summarise for you;

Hour upon hour spent in the playpark

Miss 10 can now skate on rollerblades like a hero

Miss 7 can now skate and skateboard

Miss 5 can now skate and skateboard

Lots of bruised bottoms, lots of being picked up off the ground, but mostly lots of laughter.

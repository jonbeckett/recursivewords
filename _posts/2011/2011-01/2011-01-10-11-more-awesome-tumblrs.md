In the spirit of reaching out a little further (read: extending the desperate death grip), and doing things by the example of the guitarist in Spinal Tap, I've been on another following expedition. Here's tonight's many and varied catch;

The Hum of Nostalgia

Meklarian

Gatsby Lives

Yeah So?

Beeborg

Irreverend

Now, don't take this the wrong way

OneSmallFire

That's What She Said

And How!

Anarchy & Scotch

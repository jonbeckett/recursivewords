A couple of evenings ago while washing up the dinner things, I heard the outbreak of war in our living room - or at least the version of war that occurs between a five year old, a six year old, and a ten year old.

It would appear the older girls were taking a certain delight in pressing Little Miss Five's buttons - and she was reacting in the same manner she has learned from her Mum - simmering anger followed by a fast, verbal explosion.

"RIGHT. That's it 

"I VERY ANGRY WITH YOU! AND GOODBYE!"

Both myself and W looked towards the lounge just in time to see a high speed five year old, arms crossed, marching as fast as she could from the lounge, towards the stairs. She was travelling so fast she had to bank as she turned the corner into the hallway. We broke the cardinal rule we both laughed out loud.

Another pronouncement came from half-way up the stairs;

"I REALLY VERY ANGRY NOW!"

After stopping laughing (which took some time), I wandered to the foot of the stairs and smiled at Little Madam, who was doing her best to look really,veryangry. My smile met her frown, and she cracked

A giggle spat from her pursed lips, and she couldn't look angry any more. I picked her up, her legs wrapped around me, we wandered back downstairs, and she tried her best to look annoyed as her Mum met us in the middle of the kitchen and kissed her on the forehead.

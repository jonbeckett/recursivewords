About a year ago I unfollowed everybody in my Facebook "friends" list, and began building back people I care about. With that in mind, and the amazing people I have met on Tumblr recently, I thought it might be a good time to invite people to connect with me on Facebook too if they have not done so yet.

Feel free to visit me, and request friendship!

I had to unfollow somebody today. I didn't do it lightly, and I'm still wondering about it now.

While the behaviour I have been witnessing was not directed towards me, it makes little difference - there can be no justification for being thoughtless, mean, and nasty to others. When people reach out to you, what possible explanation defends blanking, belittling, or berating those efforts?

I'm not naming any names, because that would lower me to a similar level.

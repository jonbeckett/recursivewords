Sat here, in the lounge, on my own. Other half is at something to do with the school. Kids are in bed asleep, television is off, and I'm noodling around on the internet (always dangerous).

Colleague at work was telling me about a chat client for your phone called WhatsApp earlier today. I don't understand why anybody would install something like that - when everybody else is using Google Talk, Windows Live Messenger, and so on.

Do people really use IM much any more? I occasionally catch up with close friends via either Google Talk or Facebook Chat, but that's about it I hardly ever touch Skype any more either.

Perhaps it's because I don't know anybody any more life and work have conspired to pretty much destroy friendships outside of work - which may be why I turn to the internet late at night, and far flung friends in foreign lands.

I spy some leftover Brandy from Christmas. Ha haaa (shouted silently in the style of Captain Jack Sparrow). If only we had some Rum.

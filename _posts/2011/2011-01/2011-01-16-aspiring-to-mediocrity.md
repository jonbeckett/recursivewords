I caught myself looking at the visitor statistics on this tumblr account earlier. It occurred to me that it would be all too easy to become obsessed with gaining followers, visitors, or faux "friends".

In the great scheme of things, the numbers don't reallymatter. I don't really matter. This blog is about me, my life, my story, my views. It's never going to be that interesting to others, and perhaps it shouldn't be. If somebody trips over it once in a while and writes a nice comment, that's finebut I'm not going to go looking for attention.

It's a lifestream. The day to day story, thoughts and opinions of a (fairly) normal guy struggling through the same things as everybody else, fighting the same battles, complaining about all the same crap, and sometimes laughing at the same jokes.

Mediocrity is a surprisingly comfortable suit of clothes that I wear rather easily, and requires very little maintenance. I like that.

I finally escaped this evening to watch the latest Harry Potter movie on the big screen, accompanied by a wonderful friend and fellow fan of the books.

I'm not going to go off on some huge introspective review of the movie. I am going to go find the book though - it's so long since I read it, I can't remember how it all ends (beyond them all living happily ever after, obviously).

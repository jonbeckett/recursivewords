I just returned from a supplies gathering mission at the local store. We have friends coming later armed with pizzas for a movie night. We've been doing this off and on since we had the kids, following cessation of our attempts to win the local pub quiz each week.

Given that a night in with friends costs about half that of a night out, we realised while agreeing with each other about going out being a "waste of money" that we're all getting old and boring.

The only thing left to be decided on is the movie. It will be talked over throughout - so it either needs to be something we all know, or something requiring minimal attention. Somehow this quest for mindless movies has occasionally turned into a quest for the worst movies - and we've seen some realrubbish. Two that immediately come to mind are "Balls of Fire", and "Land of the Lost".

If I can move later after eating enough pizza to satisfy arhinoceros, I'll report back on the movie. If not, call the emergency services for me;

"Which service do you require?"

"Ambulance please"

"What is the nature of the emergency"

"Our friend ate enough pizza to develop his own gravity. He's becoming visibly smaller, and more powerfully attractive."

"Attractive?"

"No - not thatkind of attractive - unless you think it's attractive to have a gut big enough to balance a pizza box on - attractive in the sense that if we throw a cheeto past him, it goes into a really low and fast orbit".

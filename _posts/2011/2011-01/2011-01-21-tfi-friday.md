Just got in from work. It's been a fairly brainiac end to the week; trying to understand and add to a mass of code that has been mashed up over many months, between many other projects. Not fun.

Looking forward to a weekend doing nothing. The likelihood of that happening is pretty much zero - I imagine by the end of this evening visits to family, friends and/or shopping trips will have been added to my schedule - not to mention the usuals; tidying up, washing up, washing clothes, ironing, etc.

Perhaps if I take the kids to the park, I will get out of the less exciting prospects?

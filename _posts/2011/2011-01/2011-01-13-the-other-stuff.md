I thought this might make a good topic for a post - the "other things" that are in your bag. Just to make it a bit more interesting, I figured out if I could fit in on top of my current Moleskine...

And we have...

A multi-format USB card reader

An 8Gb USB memory stick (16Gb attached to my keys)

64Mb USB stick remnant of Victorinox penknife that I had on my keyring going through checkin in an airport (the rest of it went in the sharps bin).

Steel Fountain pen

Steel Rollerball pen

Cheap rollerball pen

Drawing pen (typically used in the Moleskine)

BT 3G Dongle

Vodafone 3G Dongle

Assorted MicroSD memory card readers

Assorted SDHD Memory cards

I'm guessing all the USB connectors give away that I'm either a colossal nerd, or a professional software and web developer...

This entire weekend has vanished up it's own ass so fast it's almost unfathomable. It hasn't been allbad though. I just finished putting the kids to bed after organising a "movie night" for them.

If you were wondering, Mrs Beckett has gone to the cinema with her Mum to watch "The King's Speech".

We had popcorn, nachos, fizzy drinks, and pizza. I'm not quite sure - given their relative body sizes - how the younger children manage to pack away as much popcorn as they do. It's almost supernatural.

Main memory of the night? Our eldest daughter sitting on my lap with her hands over her face, clamped against my chest during the finale of the movie.And the movie rating? Supposedly a PG.

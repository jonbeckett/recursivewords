While I may have intimated earlier that most of us prepare the best version of ourselves for public consumption, I completely ignored the others.

You know - thevacuousnarcicist minority that obsess over themselves, their worries, their failures, their world, their self. While it's easy to discount them, or remain aloof while peering down our noses from atop our invented authority of all things authorly in the blogosphere, they do something we do not.

They speak their mind. They carry their heart on their sleeve. They bare their soul.

Perhaps this means there is balance to the community; and the more people it comprises of, the better that balance becomes. While we might not likeeverybody out there, nobody is any less valuable than anybody else - we can all learn from each other, and admire qualities in each other that we do not have.

If we were all the same, we wouldn't be anywhere near as interesting.

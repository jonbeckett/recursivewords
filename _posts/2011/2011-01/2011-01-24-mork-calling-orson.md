While the international nature of Tumblr is fantastic, it occurred to me this evening that it might be interesting to find a few people to follow a little closer to home - you know, like on the same continent.

Finding them might be something of a challenge. I'm guessing searches for keywords or place names might be the best way forward.

Wish me luck!

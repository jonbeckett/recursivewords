If you would like to help me procrastinate this afternoon, feel free to add me on any of the following networks;

Google Talk - jonathan.beckett@gmail.com

Yahoo Messenger - jonathan.beckett@yahoo.co.uk

Windows Live Messenger - jonathan.beckett@live.co.uk

Blackberry Instant Messenger - 2189F478

Back in ten minutes - off to make coffee for colleagues - will fire up IM apps on my return.

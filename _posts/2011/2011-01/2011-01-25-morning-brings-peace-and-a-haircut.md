Looking back over my posts last night, I must have been in a hell of a foul mood. I knowthe team at Tumblr is small (probably smaller than the company I work for), and I knowthey are fighting fires all over the place at the moment - mostly because they have built a great platform that people love to use.

The reason we love to use Tumblr?

The community.

I have or have had memberships at Twitter, WordPress, Facebook, Blogger, Posterous, Identica, Buzz, Plurk, Jaiku, LiveJournal, among others. I have spent time reaching out to the community at each of them - and yet I invariably return to Tumblr, because although not perfect, the people make it better than the sum of it's parts.

This is the bit where I wave a toy flag with "sorry" written on it in Comic Sans above my head.

In other news, I had a haircut on the way in to work this morning (picture later, promise). Getting it cut mainly consisted of sitting and listening to a sob story about the hair stylist's children who were being terrorised by some little kid at school. I don't remember all of the story - I switched off after the first few minutes.

p.s. I've been fiddling with the template of the tumblog again.

It's just gone 9pm, and I'm sat in the study, wondering where the day went. "Sparks" by "The Who" is playing in the background, I have a glass of Brandy (slowly working my way through the leftover drink from Christmas), and am wondering what on earth I might write about to entertain those who might read this.

How about recounting the story of one of my colleagues having something of a falling down moment this morning when somebody walked along the corridor above his office with particularly loud foot-falls? It apparently annoyed him enough to get him out of his chair, up the stairs, and face to face with somebody.

I've got news for everybody - there is no sound in the known universe as loud as our seven year old. We once asked her to shout a sentence as loud as she could, and marvelled at her transformation into a mini Brian Blessed. It was genuinely scary.

In all fairness, there are things that annoy me from time to time too at work, but I tend keep them to myself. Having a go at somebody about anything means you then have to live with the ill feeling that might be caused. Most people genuinely have no idea that they might be causing distress to others.

Take riding my bike to and from work. On the way home tonight, I had three near misses with cars - all of which were purely because the drivers were in a world of their own. Luckily I was expectingthem to behave in the way they did, which pretty much saved me from hospitalisation as it does pretty much everynight.

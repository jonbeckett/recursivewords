A conversation that happened early this morning with our eldest...

Me : "What would you like for breakfast? - you can't have cereals - your sisters have eaten them all... toast?"

Her : "Umm...."

She stands, staring into space.

Me : "Come on, make your mind up."

Her : "Ok. A slice of toast with peanut butter on please."

Me : "We have no peanut butter - you ate the last of it yesterday, remember"

Her : "Oh."

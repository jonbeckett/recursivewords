I posted to the official Tumblr support email address earlier, asking for an estimate on the server scaling they wrote about late last year (they mentioned tripling the capacity of their infrastructure).

I received a stock reply

Hi Jonathan,

Our developers are aware of this issue and will fix it as soon as they can. Thanks for your patience.

Sorry for the trouble,

Renee

I realise Tumblr probably have hundreds of similar messages to deal with, but if I responded with that answer in my capacity as a professional software developer on behalf of the company I work for to a client, I would be in a fair amount of trouble.

I wanted a time estimate. Not a stock message.

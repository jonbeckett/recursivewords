Although I've been a member of Tumblr since it was still in beta, I have only really immersed myself in the community recently. I think I first heard about it in one of Leo Laporte's TWiT podcasts back in 2007 - I'm not sure if Amber MacArthur reported on it going live, or if David Karp went on the show to talk about it.

Although I have often dipped into and out of the Tumblr community, I have never stuck around long enough to discover the people of most interest to me - those sharing their life, their thoughts, and their ideas. Don't get me wrong; I love the creative tumblogs, such as Wordboner and Booklover, but they don't tell a story - you cannot engage with them.

This week I stuck around long enough for the discovery process to happen on it's own, and it's totally changed my view of Tumblr, and the value I subconsciously attach to it as a platform, and the people within it as friends.

You are all awesome.

I look forward each day to catching up with the rag-tag collection of far flung friends I have begun following. While out and about I am seeing the world through different eyes - your eyes - anticipating that which might be interesting, and recording it to be shared when the opportunity presents itself.

Here's to us all. An unlikely gathering of diverse minds, sharing our days, our thoughts, and a little of our lives with each other

I have no excuses with drawing, and should perhaps do it far more. I did art at college years ago. It's the one thing I've always been able to just do - much to the annoyance of anybody I've ever known that aspired to be able to draw or paint.

Of course, in the contrary spirit of anybody who has a talent, I have no interest what so ever in drawing and painting, but I do take advantage of it from time to time. Whatever part of my brain handles it also has something to do with the photographs I take, and the work I do (software and web development) - I'm the one that always gets landed with making user interfaces look nice.

I'll have a dig around and see if I can find any old drawings and paintings to share on Tumblr. I'm thinking I may have shared some of it way-back.

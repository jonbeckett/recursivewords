Yesterday evening I went to the local theatre with our children and the leader of Rainbows (young brownies/guides) to see the pantomime production of "Peter Pan" we should have seen before Christmas, and that snow put an end to.

The rest of this week I am working from home while we have various things done to the office where I work... it's going to be odd, after spending so long with the children recently - being here completely on my own. W will be at work, and the kids will be at school...

I guess tomorrow morning will be the first "real" day for us all operating in our new guise as a working family, with everybody at school. We will have routines to figure out, and things to get done each morning from now on.

I'm guessing tomorrow night's blog post might be quite entertaining.

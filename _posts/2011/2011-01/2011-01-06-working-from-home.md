Today finds me sat in the study at home once more, on account of the offices at work undergoing something of a renovation. The office I would normally reside in is "out of bounds" until the builders and decorators have done their work.

So. Here I am - two cups of coffee down, several chocolate biscuits, and thinking I should perhaps go and make a sandwich.

p.s. I ventured forth across Tumblr again last night, and discovered all manner of interesting people. It's becoming increasingly persuasive.

p.p.s. got back in touch with an old school friend last night on Facebook - which has cemented even further in my mind that Facebook has turned some kind of corner; it has become a force for good. Yes, they have nightmares from time to time, but they generally try to do the right thing.

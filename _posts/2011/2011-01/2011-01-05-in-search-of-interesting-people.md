I have somehow reached the point with Tumblr where I have far more people following me than I am following, and I'm not altogether happy about that. In order to bring balance back to the force, it feels like I should be searching out new people to follow.

The candidates need to be;

Interesting

Original

Candid

Thoughtful

I tend to like people who write- who lifestream - rather than those who bombard and reblog in pursuit of popularity.

Any suggestions?

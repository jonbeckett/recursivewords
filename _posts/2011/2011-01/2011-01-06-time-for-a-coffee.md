After having my head in and out of C# and SQL all morning and most of the afternoon, I'm taking a few minutes out to have a coffee a really terrible instant Cappuccino. I don't know why I keep buying them - I should really plonk the monkey down on a decent coffee machine for the kitchen.

Only problem - I'm the only one who drinks coffee.

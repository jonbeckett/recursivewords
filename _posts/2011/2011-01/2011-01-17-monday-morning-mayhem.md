Waking up and dragging myself out of bed this morning was hard. I suspect it might have had somethingto do with yesterday - where the greater part of the day was spent either sat in the playpark, washing up, tidying up, putting kids through the bath, or listening to bedtime stories.

I might as well have left the bike at home today, and swam to work. Just to add to the torrential rain and overflowing drains, most of the drivers in the back streets seemed to have flicked some kind of "idiot" switch.

Rain apparently means everybody else is invisible, you count more than anybody else, everybody else is in your way, and all you care about in the world is your self.

At least I'm here, at work, in the dry, with C# and SQL to ponder over. They seem to make a lot more sense than the real world at the moment.

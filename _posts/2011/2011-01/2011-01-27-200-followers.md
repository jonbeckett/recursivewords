And so it came to pass, on this day, that 200 people had thus far mistakenly clicked the "follow" instead of "like" button on my tumblog.

Of course I jest.

Seriously, I am loving Tumblr - and it's all because of you - yes, you - sat there in front of your computer, holding your phone, or wherever you happen to be. You are awesome, interesting, funny, candid, and you make this place a favourite destination each day.

I have a horrible feeling the reason my "Professional" theme for Tumblr is not clearing the hurdle for the theme garden is because of the social links.

The theme submission rules state;

No external assets. Host ALL assets(images, css, js, etc.)with ourstatic file uploader.

No third-party widgets. All widgets(Disqus, Flickr, etc.)and placeholder content (blogrolls, etc.) must be commented out.

Must support all post types. Include Text, Photo, Quote, Link, Chat, Audio, and Video blocks.

Must support standard tags. Include {RSS} (never use "/rss"), {Favicon}, {CustomCSS}, {LinkOpenTag} (for Photo posts), {MetaDescription}, and {PhotoAlt}.

Try to include {PostNotes}, {NoteCount}, {Description}, search, and custom colors where aesthetically acceptable.

Must meet the aesthetic standards of Tumblr. Themes that are unattractive or lacking functionality may be rejected at our moderator's discretion.

I'm guessing I'm falling foul of the 2nd ruleI have social icons that show up in the header if you fill out the URLs of the other social services in the "Customize" panel of the blog.

I'm not sure I want to water the theme down to the extent they want.

It would help if those doing the approvals told me whatwas wrong with it, rather than just saying the following;

Moderator feedback: Does not meet alltheme requirements. Please edit so we can accept!

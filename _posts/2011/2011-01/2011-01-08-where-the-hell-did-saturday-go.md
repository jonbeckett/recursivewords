How on earth is it nearly midnight already?

Perhaps the slippage of time can be explained by me buggering around with Drupal again - taking it upon myself to install it at jonbeckett.com once again. There is some method to my madness - an actual reason - but I won't bother elaborating at the moment. It's boring enough without me yabbering on about it.

Most of the day was spent with the kids today. I'm more or less stopped working on freelance webdesign projects completely now, and the end result is the fun we all had today. Yes, I spent hours in the playpark freezing my ass off, but the kids had more fun than in ages on skateboards and rollerskates.

Discovery of the day was that our eldest daughter - "Miss 10" as I often refer to her - has something of a talent for skating. I guess her ability needs to be transposed against her little sisters - "Little Miss 5" and "Little Miss 6" - who both learned to use a skateboard. Actually, "learn" is the wrong term; they just did it.

Little Miss 6 is one of those kids that you dare not watch; she has absolutely no fear of anything, and throws herself into things a little bit too daringly. It's like she's always operating at 11. This of course meant she ended up having a spectacular skateboard crash in the middle of the playpark, flying in the air and ending up on her ass - cue oscar winning tears.

It didn't really help - as she stood there crying, holding her own ass - that Little Miss 5 skated past shouting "I can do it Dad - look"

After a day tinkering with HTML and CSS, following my nose rather than a carefully evolved design, I have ended up with a half-respectable Tumblr theme. If you're looking at this post via my tumblog, the results of my tinkering are in front of your nose.

I imagine the theme will evolve over the coming days and weeks, but essentially I am happy with it; which begs a question; what do I do next?

I gave it away.

In the best tradition of the open source movement, even before the theme has made it into the Tumblr Theme Garden, I have released the source code to the community, and informed the wandering crowd at Buzz, and Forrst. What happens next is not in my hands, and I could not be happier.

Sometimes it's nice to give something back. In this case, I was looking for a Tumblr theme to use for my own tumblog, and couldn't find anything. Now others will be able to share the theme, evolve it, change it, bend it, break it, and otherwise give rise to further creativity.

That makes me happy.

If you want to download the theme and use it, you can get it here.

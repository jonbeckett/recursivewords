In the last year I have been something of an online vagrantwandering the streets of the various blogging platforms, trying to find a place to likea place to "fit in". A few things have become apparent to me about the various "platforms" online;

Facebook Best suited to family, friends, and psychotic people you once knew or went to school with who you will then "un-friend", and receive hate mail from. Sharing anything invites judgement from everybody, and comments from the most needy during the dead of night.

WordPress Perfect for long rambling tomes of navel gazage. If you've always wanted to write a novel about yourself in 20,000 parts, this is the place to do it. You can enable all manner of social sharing gadgetary, but it will not be used because in reality you're the only person remotely interesting in your own life.

Tumblr While feeling good about yourself, Tumblr is the perfect place to invest time in order to realise that no, you don't really matter that much. No matter how creative you think you might be, a photo of a kitten, or some girl's ass is always going to attract far more attention than your life stream, or insightful commentary about the day. That being said, the community isfantastic, and you're far less likely to run into your relatives.

Twitter If Tumblr is shallow, Twitter is positively vacuous. Think of it as the perfect place to drip your meaningless content into a vast, fast flowing river. You are one voice among millions, and even if thousands follow you, nobody is listening. The quote from Alien nearly had it rightit should have read "on the internet, nobody is listening anyway".

While tangled up with the routine, chores, and requirements that fall upon us as expectation earlier, I became increasingly frustrated about the lack of time I get to pursue my own interests. Writing, reading, connecting with friends

As we leave the weekend once more, and head into the work week, chances such as this one - that finds me writing these words - will dry up once more. The blogging community will once again become a silent crowd viewed from a passing car window.

I need to find more time.It's really about spending time with myselflistening to my own musicwriting my own wordssharing my own pictures - connecting with my friends.

Life has a habit of sneaking up on us from time to time, and the unimportant consumes us. No matter how selfless we might like to be, we forget the most important thing to look after is number one. It pays to investto find something for yourself, that belongs to nobody else.

Your thoughts belong to you, and you alone. The words you share are a manifestation of those thoughts, and as such are a piece of you shared with the passing crowd.

While immersing myself back into the world of those who blog over recent weekswho share their life and thoughts onlineI found myself thinking about commenting; about their importance or unimportance. After worrying for some days that comments could be seen as a form of attention seeking, I realised something.

Feedback from the passing crowd reminds us that we are not all the same. The differences make people interestingwithout them our stories, views, and opinions would hold no interest.Concordant feedback leads to the affirmation that you are a part of something bigger than yourselfthat you are not alone in your thoughts and opinions. You're not quite as weird as you perhaps thought.

Weird is good though. Everybody needs to embrace their inner weird sometimes. The really weird stuff is always the most interesting, and yet typically it is only discovered by those closest to usthose we share our life with.

If you happen upon this philosophical navel examination of a post, thankyou. Thank you for taking the time. Now go embrace your inner weirdness, and share a little of it with the world.

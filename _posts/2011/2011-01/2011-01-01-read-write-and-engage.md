While playing with Tumblr over the last few days, I have been reminded how great the community is, how much creativity is going on, and how much more people share here compared to just about anywhere else online;

Facebook is remarkably insular - every person is encouraged to construct their own walled garden of friends and family. Should you choose to share something, your reach is only as far as those who "know" you.

Twitter is a polar opposite of sorts - while your voice has no boundary, it also has no differentiation from anybody else; therefore you become lost amid the chaos.

WordPress (and Blogger to a lesser extent) occupy the rarified upper atmosphere; populated - certainly for lifestreaming purposes - with those who are willing to expend time and effort constructing their thoughts into crafted works, and willing to consume each other's thoughts and ideas at some length.

Tumblr sits somewhere in the middle ground. Neither long form, short form, restrictive, or constrictive. Either by design or luck - I'm sure others have written at length about this - the community is open, and sharing is a given.

So what does Tumblr hold for me during 2011? Perhaps some resolutions might better bracket my thoughts than a paragraph of navel gazage;

Read Take more time to read the dashboard - to consume the thoughts of those I follow, and not just tick "like".

Write Use the "Text" button more - share the story of interesting days, expound on wacky thoughts, and deliberate over idiotic opinions.

Engage Hit the reply button on friends posts, ask questions, and reach out more than I have in the past. Be there both to celebrate with, and to lend support when needed.

Various "famous sayings" around the world advise us that if we look after the basics, the bigger picture will look after itself. Finding out is going to be fun.

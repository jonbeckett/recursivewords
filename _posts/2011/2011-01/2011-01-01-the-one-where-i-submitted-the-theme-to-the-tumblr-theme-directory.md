I doubt very much that there are any staff beyond skeleton support staff at Tumblr today, so don't expect the theme this blog is based on to appear any time soon in the Theme Directory.

In the meantime, feel free to download the following text file, and paste it into the "custom HTML" box of your Tumblr theme

I have done everything (I think) required of the theme directory;

All the graphics have been uploaded to the Tumblr servers

All the social links are configurable through the "Customize" panel

Google Analytics is built in (set through Customize)

Twitter is built in (set through Customize)

All the appropriate sidebar panels can be switched on and off in the customize panel too - such as Followers, Likes, etc.

The HTML is very clean, and the CSS follows standards. I have tested the theme in IE, Firefox and Chrome, so it should work for most browsers.

If you have any feedback, feel free to fire questions at my Tumblr ask page.

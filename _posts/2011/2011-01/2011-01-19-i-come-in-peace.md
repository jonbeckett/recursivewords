Greetings to all those I have begun following over the past few weeks - an odyssey that has opened my eyes to the awesome community that exists at Tumblr is spite of the continualseismic rumbles that seem to afflict the servers. I've been quietly existing withing the massed ranks of the tumblrati for years under various names, and in various guizes, but have only recently ventured forth, nervously introducing myself to far flung strangers.

If you were wondering about the real name on the account, it's basically because I've always appeared as myself on the net - never (well hardly ever) under a pseudonym. I've thought about it lots of times, but it always gets complicated before I've even done anything. I'm also rubbish at lying.

So. This is me. Regular guy. Work as a software and web developer - building the sites you complain about both at work, and in the wild. I've been at this stuff long enough to be deservedly cynical about it, and occasionally vent in public. Enjoy it when I do.

I will endeavour to follow your contribution to the tumblrsphere, and if you suspect I am not listening, feel free to hassle the crap out of me via the means splurged all over the aboutpage.

I'm always online say hello

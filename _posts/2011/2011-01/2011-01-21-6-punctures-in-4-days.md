This is getting a bit silly. I was late in to work this morning because the bike had a flat on the way home last night, and after fixing it, and checking over the front tyre again, it flatted again on the way in to work.

Aaaarrgggghhh!

While checking the tyre, I discovered the latest culprit; a shard of glass embedded in the outer wall. I'm guessing that somebody has seeded glass into the gravel on a particular part of my journey because they don't like people riding past their house it would make sense, based on the times the punctures have occurred.

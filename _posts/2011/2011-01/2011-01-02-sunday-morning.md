I'm sat here in my Hong Kong Fooey t-shirt, wondering what to do with myself. The younger children are already up, eldest is still fast asleep, other half is still fast asleep, and the world outside seems pretty damn quiet.

Aside from the usual list of chores (washing up, tidying up after three little maniacs, feeding the cats, letting the chickens out, etc), I'm wondering if I should kick back a little today.

Time to log off perhaps?

Time to get the Kindle out and just sit - sit and read. I've been reading "The Right Stuff" by Tom Wolfe - an amazing book that I've been meaning to read since before I can remember not wanting to read it (if that makes sense).

Anyway. Sunday's a wasting. Time to move.

Maybe a cup of tea first (how do I manage to sound so much like a damn Hobbit?)

About six months ago I started noodling around with some top secret programming (I was going to write "secret squirrel programming", but guessed that nobody would understand the reference), but client project work got in the way, and I ended up putting it to one side.

As these things tend to pan out, other things got put on top of it, pushed it sideways, sideways some more, and before I knew, it was forgotten. Relegated to the folders full of "half assed ideas" rattling around the darker corners of the file system.

Until just now.

I just rediscovered it, dusted the code off, loaded it up, and started trying to get my head around what I had built - and am actually quietly impressed with it. This is not unusual of course I am always pretty self deprecating when it comes to my own stuff.

This though, this is clever stuff.

I'm actually amazed that it was me that did it does that make any sense?

A friend of mine on the other side of the planet introduced me to a novel idea some years ago. Let me explain:

In your wallet/bag/purse you hold a baseball card. The card has the picture, and name of a celebrity you have always placed on a pedestal. If the situation should ever present itself, you are allowed to play the card - to do anything involving that person without question orrepercussion. Your significant other is allowed a similar card, with the same rules. The cards can only be used once.

She had Simon Le Bon on her card. Who would be on yours?

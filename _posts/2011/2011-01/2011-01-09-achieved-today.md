Took kids shopping

Spent all kids Christmas vouchers - each child chose clothes with a little direction from us.

Bought Little Miss 6 (soon to be 7) her birthday present - a variety of Play People toys.

Acquired DVD box sets of "Black Books", and "Dark Skies", and theDVD of "Paprika" at last - will be interesting to compare against Inception to see how much of a plot lift Inception really is.

Bought and constructed two standing lamps for the lounge

Washed up

Tidied up

Played with the kids

Not an entirely unsuccessful Sunday

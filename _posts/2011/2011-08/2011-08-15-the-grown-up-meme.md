Apparently the idea of this meme is to write about what you wanted to be when you were growing upor what you want to be when you grow up (I might count myself in that group from time to time).

I know exactly what I wanted to be when I grew upmostly because my family trot this story out to anybody that will listen when anything vaguely related to this subject comes up in conversation at social gatherings.

I wanted to be a hot dog man.

Yes. The guy at the roadside, selling hotdogs from a van. That's what I wanted to do. I'm guessing I would have been about five or six years old when I made the proclamation, probably because I loved hotdogs more than anything else in the world.

I had it all worked out too. I knew the price of sausages and bread from the local store. Evidently I thought electricity and tomato ketchup were free, because I never remember figuring them into the equation at all.

I'm not sure at what point the aim turned from selling hotdogs to becoming a professional software developer perhaps they're the same thing really?

Jesus and his brother start a political movement opposing the government. Eventually the government have him killed.

Two hundred years later a number of books about the political movement are re-written and bound together into one anthology, and it becomes more popular than the Celestial Home Care Omnibus, better selling than 53 More Things to Do in Zero Gravity, and more controversial than Oolon Colluphid's trilogy of philosophical blockbusters: Where God Went Wrong, Some More of God's Greatest Mistakes, and Who Is This God Person, Anyway?Oh sorry I always mix up truth and fiction, because you can't make this stuff up.

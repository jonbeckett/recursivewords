It's heading towards 2am. I should have been asleep hours ago, and yet here I amsat in the dark, listening to a Tim McGraw album, avoiding the internethaemorrhagingitself over the news from Apple (if you've been living under a rock, Steve Jobs resigned).

Lets snap out of this. What have I been up to?Tinkering. That's what. Putting a few more pieces of the jigsaw in place to begin doing freelance work again. I'm not entirely sure where the freelance work will come from yet, but it's going to be interesting touching base with previous contacts once again.

Completely by coincidence, the evening I decided to start doing freelance webdesign again, two different clients from way-back-when got in touch with me. It was spooky.

I do believe I just did the biggest yawn in the history of yawns. Perhaps I shouldgo fall into bed.

Tomorrow is another day. Oh, wait it's tomorrow already, isn't it. Seems a lot like yesterday at this point.

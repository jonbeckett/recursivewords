Nobody I work with sucks. Nothing I am working on sucks (well maybe it does sometimes, but I would most likely be marched straight in for a quiet talking to if I chose to vent any frustrations about that, so I'll choose not to).

The day sucked.

Imagine a scene in your headyou're peacefully riding your bicycle past a field full of wheat, gently blowing in the wind as you whistle along a quiet country lane shaded by poplars.

All of a sudden you hear a twanging sound, followed by a distant rattle. It takes you a few moments to realise it was a spoke falling from your wheel. Before you know it ten more have scattered across the country lane and the bicycle is now careering inevitably towards a thick tree trunk.

You lift your hands from the handlebars, shut your eyes, and brace for the impact because there's nothing you can do about it.

Yes.

It's been that kind of day.

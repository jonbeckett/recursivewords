Two days ago I was cycling home from work, and an old man walked to the edge of the road ahead of me, looked both ways, and then stepped out directly in front of me. I hit the brakes hardthe forks compressed almost all the way down, and I struggled to keep the back wheel on the floor. He didn't even glance at me. He knew damn well what he had done.

Yesterday I was cycling home from work, and on a pretty fast downhill stretch around a blind bend, I met two kids on BMXs on the wrong side of the road, heading towards me. I hit the anchors, and the back wheel started to come around, sliding me out to the center of the road. They mumbled apologies, and carried on on the path.

Today I was cycling home from work, and a fat businessman walked out directly in front of me on the exit of a junction while shouting on his mobile phone. I so wanted to shout "FUCKING IDIOT" at him, but instead concentrated on swerving crazily across the road, neatly between waiting cars while mouthing silent swear words.

The next person that chances their arm in front of me? I'm going to have you.

I've been thinking about the hurricane, because I have a couple of friends who live along the coast that's being hit. While watching the initial reports of land-fall this morning, this occurred to me;If everybody who evacuated is safe, Obama will be blamed for advocating an evacuation that was not needed.

If many are killed, Obama will be castigated for not doing enough.

The guy can't win.

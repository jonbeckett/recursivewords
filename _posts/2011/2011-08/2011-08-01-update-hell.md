I re-installed Windows 7 on the netbook late last night. Google Chromium was great, but there were a few things that just didn't work properly (like sound, the webcam, and the internal microphone). Sure, I could get them working if I broke out "console mode", but the idea of a netbook is it's a utilitycomputer.

I can put up with Windows taking half a minute to boot up if it means everything will just work. Of course if I was independently wealthy, I would buy a Google Chromebook tomorrow.

So. Sat here waiting for Windows Update to finish making chugging and grinding noises. It's been at it for about an hour so farperforming 85 updates to god knows what.

Ohhang onrebootIn the meantime I'm writing this utter garbage to pass the time. I may or may not admit to re-installing DropBoxdespite them being hacked recently, it's by far the easiest way of copying files between the computers I use. Not sure if I'll bother installing it on the phone.

And another rebootI'm guessing Windows 7 SP1 and Internet Explorer 9 are going to try and hose the computer. I was going to finish this post here, but lets wait for the reboot and see how many more reboots it can throw at me when the damn thing wakes up.16 more updatesWhat the hell can it possiblybe updating? Is it changing it's underpants or something? What the hell?I'll try and share something a little more interesting laterI might even write it on the netbook, or at least I will when it's changed it's socks, or whatever it might dream up next.

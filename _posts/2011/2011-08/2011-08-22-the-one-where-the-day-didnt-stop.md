Ok, I know the title of this post doesn't make the greatest amount of senseof course days don't stop.

That would imply some kind of contravention of physics as we know it, which isn't going to happen no matter how hard whole bands of idiots pray to their chosendeities.

The day just didn't stoprisk me being shot, and (b) bore you to death.

So. Here I am. It's 8:30pm, and this is the first few minutes I've had to myself all day. Rather than completely waste them surfing garbage on the internet, or being lured into watching Big Brother on the TV, I'm wasting your time insteadfilling your browser with this brain dump.

Here's hoping the evening gets better.

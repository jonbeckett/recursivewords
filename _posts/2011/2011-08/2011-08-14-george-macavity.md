Our car crash surviving cat is getting better at a rate of knots. This morning, while making breakfasts, washing up, letting the chickens out, and emptying his litter tray, he realised I left the window open just a bit too far.

As I stood there washing up, he nonchalantly walked past the kitchen window.

The first thought that went through my head was "oh crap", closely followed by "Oh crap, now I'm in trouble".

Sure enough, our six year old early warning system (World Champion Tell Tale, 2011), raced up to tell her Mum, who appeared in the back garden alongside me within half a minute.

The conversation ended with her stomping off towards the house, and me shouting over my shoulder;"THAT'S RIGHTIT'S ALL MY FAULTJUST LIKE EVERYTHING ELSEGO ONHAVE A GO AT ME"At one point the cat re-appeared outside the back door. I walked to meet him, and he sprinted flat-out into the jungle that surrounds our entire garden. So much for having a broken leg and pelvisAfter a bit of lateral thinkingrealising he hadn't eaten anythingI took all the food up. Within half an hour he was back at the house, probably tired, but also hungry. Chalk one up for humans versus felines for a change.

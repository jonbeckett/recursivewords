I arrived at work some time before 9 this morning. I left some time just after 6 this evening. The hours inbetween were a blur. The last few days have been.

I would say "I need a holiday", but that's the reason for the workload; we head off to the hills of Cumbria tomorrow nightI will leave work, fall into the car, and travel through the night to reach the far North of England.

In a strange twist of fate, my closest real world frield is making the same journey 24 hours later with her daughters.

I haven't looked forward to going away this much in years.

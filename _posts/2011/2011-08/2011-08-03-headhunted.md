A Google recruiter just emailed me. I wrote a terse reply back, relating the last time this happened to meessentially telling him that unless Google want me, I'm not going to expend any effort on them.

In truth, I would love to work for them (who wouldn't?), but at this stage in my career I hardly need to qualify my skills or experiencepostscriptafter initially writing me to tell me they were really interested in me, when I challenged their basis for saying that, they are not so interested after all numpties. Turns out recruitment people are just as bigger liars everywhere.

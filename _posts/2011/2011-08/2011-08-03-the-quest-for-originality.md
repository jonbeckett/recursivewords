Tumblr is different than most blogging platforms in that it encourages sharing of content through the "reblog" featureI'm guessing the designers never envisaged reblog being used so widely, with so many people acting as librarians of the same content.

There is something we can all do to help the community thoughwe can be original.

Your mission from now on? To post more often about the most interesting person you knowyourself. Share more, open up, be creative, be original, be the square peg. What are your aspirations? What do you fear? What do you love? Who do you care about, and why? What were you doing yesterday? What do you hope to do tomorrow?We're interested in who you arenot what you found.

It's been a while since I've written anything of substance in the blog. Perhaps it's time to change that. I seem to have been hanging out at all manner of social networks and micro blogging platforms, but not devoting any time or effort to this placewhere 8 years of my life hide away from the world, ready for discovery by intrepid travellers of the internet.

I'm too easily distracted. When faced with WordPress, Posterous, Tumblr, Twitter, Google+, Facebook, Flickr, and any number of other websites, I end up spreading myself too thinfollowing the latest, greatest idea until I become bored with it.

I need to stop tinkering.

Anyway what's been going on around here? Yesterday (Saturday) I took the children to see the new Smurf movie.

On the way in I was kind of dreading itthe trailer had left me cold. I should never take notice of my instincts with moviesI enjoyed it immensely, as did the children (mind you, I like most moviesso I would never be a good critic). I will admit to a few moments in the movie causing a tearthe scene with a mother and child being one of them (you will know it when you see it).

The children left the cinema humming the Smurf working song, and then I got it stuck in my head for the entire rest of the day too.

Today has been different. It wasn't helped by my decision to start doing freelance web design work againwhich saw me stay up until 3:45am on Saturday night / Sunday morning putting my site back together. If you head over to  http://jonbeckett.com [/] you'll see the fruits of the hard work.

The late night left me dead on my feet for much of the day.

Burning away at the back of my mind throughout the day has been the temptation to carry on with my normal workto login to the website of my employer and carry on the stuff I have been working on. The children pretty much put an end to those ideas for me by continually asking for me throughout the day, and then I kind of put myself forward to make dinner for everybody this evening.

So yes it's been a tiring weekend. I can't believe it's heading towards 11:30pm and I'm still awake.

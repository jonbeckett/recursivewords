There are lots of instant messaging networks, and they are all free;Google TalkYahoo Instant MessengerWindows Live MessengerAOL Instant MessengerICQSkypeFacebook ChatThe networks all have their own client software, which is greatbut means you end up running three or four clients to talk to your various friends.

Somebody asked earlier if the resurrection of jonbeckett.com means I'm going to be blogging elsewhere. I love it when I have easy questions to answer.

No, I'm not "moving" anywhere.

The whole point of me having a Tumblr, and it being relatively disassociated from everything else I do online, is to enable me to empty my head, and shout Joey style "how you doin'" remarks at pictures I like.

Tumblr is a retreat from the "professional me". Somewhere to hang out.

I hope that makes sense.

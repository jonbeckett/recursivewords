A little while ago I discovered a collection of word processing applications for various operating systems that dispense with just about every feature besides changing the display font, and saving your work.

They run full-screen and therefore conceal the world of crap that's going on in your computerthis is a good thing.

WriteMonkey (PC)WriteRoom (Mac)PyRoom (Linux)Go try them out. If you get stuck, start hitting obvious keys, like ESC, CTRL+O and CTRL+Sthey all rely on convention to find your way around (you do know the common keyboard shortcuts, don't you?).

I'm having a day offsat in the dining room of the house my inlaws are renting for the week in Cumbria, while everybody else gets ready to trudge off through the rain on a walk up a hill. Our eldest didn't want to do it, and in a way I'm quite thankfulI need some "me" time.

Most of the "holiday" has been unrelenting for me so far; making breakfasts, lunches, washing up, tidying up after children, putting them to bed, reading bedtime stories I don't mind doing it, because it gives my other half a break, but when it carries on day after day, it starts to get you down.

So. Here I am. On the internet, with time to myself, and time to catch up at last.

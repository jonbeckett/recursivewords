During my mad catch-up of the tumblrsphere this morning, I read that one of the people I have come to knowif we ever really know each other onlineis leaving; packing up, closing down, and carrying on with real life.

I've been there. I've done it. I've walked away, and I've come back. More than once.

A couple of those I have become close to have either left, or signalled their intention to leave recently, and it has made me realise the effect I might have had on others when I did it.

These relationships we build with each other are real. While it may sometimes seem that we don't care as much as we shouldthat we're not "real" friendsI beg to differ. Yes, life gets in the way, and sometimes we vanish for days on end, but we do care.

I think it has come into sharper focus since I rejoined Tumblr, and only followed a few people. I still follow surprisingly few of youbut the great thing about doing that is that I've come to know you. I've been able to read everything you have posted, to laugh, to frown, and to shake my head at your antics, or to sympathise with the slings and arrows life has thrown at you.

You have become a wonderful escape from reality for mebut a rather strange one because you are all realthe stories you tell are realyou are not actors on a stage.

I just wish I had more time to connect with you, to let you know I am reading, and that I love the things you share. I wish I could be more.

After leaving work an hour early so my other half could escape to a chiropractor appointment, I walked in the door to a kitchen to clean up, washing up to do, a lounge to clear up, and half the kids in the street running from room to room.

Half an hour later and the house looks vaguely liveable again. The kids have been banished to the playroom, the TV is switched off, and I have some peace and quiet in the lounge. I'm sat here with the netbook on my lap, and the cat is meowing from his cage (if you recall we have a bionic cat at the momentrecuperating from the operation to rebuild him in the corner of the room after picking a fight with a car). All I can hear is a huge fan blowing air across the kitchenour pathetic attempt at air conditioning.

The tiredness from going to bed at something like 3am last night has finally caught up with meI'm knackered. Since getting off my bike in a pool of sweat, I haven't recovered. Serves me right really.

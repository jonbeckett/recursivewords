One of the applications I grew to love in Ubuntu Linux was a simple text editor called "PyRoom"a full screen editor designed to provide minimal distractions.

It turns out there are really good alternatives for Windows, and Mac (before the vocal zealots arrive, it could be argued that the Mac app I'm listing here was first, but it doesn't really matter).

WriteMonkey (Windows) The most capable of the collection, with a plethora of powerful, but carefully hidden features.

DarkRoom (OSX / iOS) The app that started it allstill perhaps the most slick. Of course, being on the Mac, it's not free either.

WriteRoom (Windows) A straightforward port of DarkRoom to Windows.

PyRoom (Linux) A chance find in the depths of the Ubuntu download repository. It replicates WriteRoomI can't emphasis enough how useful it is to block everything else out from your screen while writing. It certainly helps mewhy not give it a try yourself?

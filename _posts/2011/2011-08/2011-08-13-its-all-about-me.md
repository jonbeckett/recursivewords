"Turning the Pedals" is all about me. Just me. It's not about the family guy, the father, the husband, the professional software developer, and the thousand other titles that might hang around my head in the real world.

It provides a firewall of sorts.

I get to empty my head (um, yeah, sorry about that), and I don't hurt too many people in doing so. I know some family and real-world friends will read the stuff I throw out, but because it's never about them, they will become bored and eventually stop. That's probably a good thing too.

The huge plus to this whole thing is I end up only interacting with people who are interested in me, and vice versa. It that sounds self interested, I make no apologiessometimes we need that.

We spend most of our lives being what other people want us to be. The internet gives us the chance to change the gameto be ourselves, and to choose who those others are.

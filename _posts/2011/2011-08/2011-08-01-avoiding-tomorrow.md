I'm sat here, in the dark, practising the age old tradition of avoiding tomorrow. The longer I stay up, the longer I prevent tomorrow from arriving.

Yes, I know it's stupid.

Yes, I know I'll be tired in the morning.

It's not that I don't want the morning to arriveit's just that I wish I had more time to share with you all. Maybe this is the problem of a life onlinereal life gets in the way. Work, family, chores, and children often conspire to eat most of my spare timemeaning far flung friends, blogging, and social networks get neglected.

I guess as long as I at least tryto read your updates, admire your photos, laugh at your jokes, or ask after you when you're down, then everything will be well with the world.

Now how far away is tomorrow? Is it any closer yet? No? Good.

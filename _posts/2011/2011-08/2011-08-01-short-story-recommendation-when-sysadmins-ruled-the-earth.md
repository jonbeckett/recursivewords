If you've never read any of Cory Doctorow's books, you have missed out. I discovered "When Sysadmins Ruled the Earth" amid a compilation of short stories called "Overclocked" while commuting to and from London a couple of years ago, and it remains one of the best short stories I've ever read.

It examines the aftermath of a catastrophic global biochemical attack that quite by chance leaves the staff of atmosphere controlled server rooms as potentially the only survivors.

The infrastucture that underpins the internetIRC, email, usenet, and instant messagingis used in the hours and days afterwards to reconnect people all over the globeinitially through the server farms of the tech giants.

I've always had something of a love affair with French cinemathey seem to take far more risks than other countriesresulting in original and enthralling movies that would never have left a studio anywhere else.

A few of my favouritesL'Homme Du Train (Jean Rochefort, Johnny Hallyday, Jean-Franois Stvenin)Jean de Florette(Yves Montand, Grard Depardieu, Daniel Auteuil)La Lectrice (Miou-Miou, Christian Ruch, Rgis Royer)Chocolat(Juliet Binoche, Judi Dench, Alfred Molina)The Chorus (Grard Jugnot, Franois Berland, Jean-Baptiste Maunier)

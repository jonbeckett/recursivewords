For some reason I woke up this morning imagining today was tomorrowthis is what happens when you take me away from the normal world, and hole me up in some godforsaken town high in the cumbrian mountains with little or no internet access for a week.

Every other shop in the town sells walking and hiking gear of various price levels, with dubious quality differences inbetween save the sought-after label, or ridiculous claims about the constituent fabric being developed for the space programme. Horseshit, I say.

This evening I had planned to take our eldest to the small cinema in town to watch Harry Potter, while the rest of the family trudged off to the same pub as last time, and the time before that, and the time before that, to have dinner together. I broke all records earlier making us pasta, peppers, carrots and Ragu sauce in time to get to the cinema.

I needn't have bothered.

After queueing outside the hundred year old cinema in the rain for quarter of an hour, we started seeing disgruntled people leaving. Finally a suitably angry person announced to the crowd "THERE ARE NO 3D GLASSES LEFT". Given that the only movie showing was "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (in 3D)", that was a bit of a disaster. Suddenly the crowd waiting in the rain erupted in non-riotous fury. Some people carried on queueingperhaps they didn't believe the evidence of their own eyes, and wanted to have a go at the hapless staff.

I pulled our daughter from the queue, and started thinking on my feet pretty damn quickly. How best to placate a ten year old who just got denied "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2? (what a ridiculous movie title, by the way)It is settled. Because I am her Dad, and I tend to have these things with me, I just happen to have hidden away in a bag that had not yet been opened; an external hard drive, an HDMI cable, and a USB to HDMI media player device. I suddenly win, and am the best Dad in the Universe. We will be staying behind this evening, and watching "The StargateDirectors Cut". She's just done a huge project at school on Egypt, so will eat it up.

In other news, it rained incessantly here todayall day. I made everybody's breakfast, everybody's lunch, eldest's and my own dinners, have done all the washing up, have tidied behind everybody, and am pretty fed upnot that you would know

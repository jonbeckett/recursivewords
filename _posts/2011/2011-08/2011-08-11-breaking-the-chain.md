Have you ever heard of the term "six degrees of seperation"? It postulates that everybody on earth is connected somehow or other through no more than six "connections" through other people.

You see it a LOT on Tumblr. If you follow somebody interesting, and then in turn follow others you notice along the way, you end up in the middle of an incestuous mire where everybody knows everybody else. It creates a closed network that I don't like.

So I'm off in search of new, interesting, and unconnectedpeople. I'm not entirely sure how I'm going to find them mind you.

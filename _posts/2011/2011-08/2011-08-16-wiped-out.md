Not many words seem to be conjuring themselves this evening to depart my fingers, and fly through the ether to the interwebs. I'm not sure why.

It's a funny expression, isn't it"wiped out"what does it really mean? That you've been erased?Our house has seemed tremendously quiet this eveningthe younger children are at a friend's house, and my better half is at a school social event. Just me and our eldest in the house, and she went to bed a couple of hours ago.

I guess I should go keep the cat company.

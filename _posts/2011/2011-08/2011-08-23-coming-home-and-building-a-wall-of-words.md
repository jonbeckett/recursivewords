That's what it feels likebeing back on my own domain name, on my own hosted installation of WordPress.

For the past several years my personal blog has been on an epic journeysurviving transition after transition. My words have flowed like a river through WordPress, Blogger, Posterous, TypePad, Vox, Yahoo 360 (remember that?), LiveJournal, Tumblr, SquareSpace, and more.

Throughout the various adventures I have somehow managed to keep the written words together. Numerous photographs have been lost along the way, but they don't really matterthe words took time and effort to record.

I've been thinking about the blog this eveningand about the future of blogging really. Everything seems to be becoming more "immediate". Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, and Google+ exemplify itwith little or no thought the here and now can be shared with any of the world that might be listening. I'm not sure I like it.

I rapidly seem to be turning into a curmudgeona relic of a previous age, when people wrote on paper, wrote letters to each other, and skill with the written word was revered. Not any more it seems.

We live in a world dominated by instant communication. It almost seems at times that our friends are whispering into our brain throughout the dayvibrating in our pocket, chiming in our ears, and flashing short messages at our retinas. It becomes more and more difficult to ignore this endless march of immediacy.

Maybe my preference of the written word is wrapped up in an inate shyness? When growing up I was always the kid wandering around at the backalways the one that didn't get pickedalways the girl's best friend, never the boyfriend. Perhaps hiding behind cleverly constructed passages of text is an extension of that?Building a wall of wordsand secretly waiting for the rainstorm that will wash it away, so that people might know me a little better.

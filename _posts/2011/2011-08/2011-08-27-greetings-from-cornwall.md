We finally left home at about 7:30 last night, and after driving through torrential rain for something in the region of 5 hours (powered by numerous bars of chocolate and energy drinks) we arrived in deepest, darkest Cornwall at about midnight.

The children slept for most of the journey, but miraculously woke as we approached Looea small fishing town just down the coast from our eventual destination. Their gasps at the sight of the night lights as we crossed the harbour bridge suddenly made our visit to the "seaside" real once more.

Five minutes later we rolled into the drive of my parents house, and everything became a blur of toothy grins, waving hands, and little people being carried from the car in their pyjamas.

I had considered leaving everything in the car, but ended up untangling five bikes, two suitcases and a thousand smaller bags, shoes, and coats immediately after we arrived. I finally sat down at about 1am.

We all slept like logs.

This morning, we are slowing the world down on purpose. I've been up since about 8amthe kids were up at 7. Showered, dressed, and planning to do nothing on purpose.

Doing nothing is surprisingly difficult.

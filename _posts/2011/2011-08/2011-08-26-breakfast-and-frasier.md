While running back and forth making breakfasts and packed lunches on a morning, I switch the television on in the corner of the kitchen and half-listen to the breakfast television presenters, the recycled news stories, and dire weather predictions for the day ahead. This morning I hit the power button, finger poised on the channel +/- buttons ready to flip to the news channels, and found the last episode of Frasier showing on some other channel.A happy accident.

I loved Frasier. It's one of the few television shows of the last few years that I would actively make time for (Big Bang Theory is the only other show that draws me in such a way). I'm not sure what it was about the quirky story of two elitist brothers living in Seattle with their grouchy Dad, but I liked it.

The final episode will always stand out in my mind because of the Tennyson quote that Frasier repeats while closing his radio show;It may be that the gulfs will wash us down:It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.

Tho' much is taken, much abides; and tho'We are not now that strength which in old daysMoved earth and heaven; that which we are, we are;One equal temper of heroic hearts,Made weak by time and fate, but strong in willTo strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.

I'm a bit of a sucker for well written words.

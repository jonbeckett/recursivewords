I cooked chips, fried eggs, and bacon for the kids for dinner this evening. They ate all of it. I know it's not "real" cooking, but they ate it all. I can't help wondering if there is some bizarre law of the universe that says the health benefits of food stuffs is inversely proportional to the likelihood children will eat it.

After dinner, we all sat down and watched Zathura for the umpteenth time as a "family movie night" thing. While I juggled the various remote controls, trying to figure out how the hell to make the DVD play on the TV, my other half grabbed her Macbook. I pulled her up for it. She then grabbed her knitting, and the kids pulled her up for that too. She then had a tantrum, threw the knitting into the middle of the room, and folded her arms.

Just as we all sat down to watch the movie, the convalescing cat decided to try out his comic timingas the opening credits rolled he retreated to his litter box and unleashed some foul smelling creation that had obviously been brewing all afternoon. It was enough to make paint come off the walls.

I don't get some people. At all.

We just got back from a charity fund-raising evening at the primary school. Each family formed teams to play a version of the "Beetle" game - where each part of a beetle is numbered (head, legs, wings, etc), and you roll a dice to draw the bits.

Of the five or so teams we played during the evening, we all had similar scores. When it came time to total everybody's scores and find a winner, perhaps a third of the teams - none of which we had played - had routinely scored 50% more points than us, or any of the teams we played against. You can form your own conclusions.

What happened to it being a charity fund-raiser? How on earth were the little children supposed to have a chance against such widespread cheating by the older children and adults?

I guess I'm too much of a Dudley Dooright.

In other news, I made the mistake of drawing my beetles nicely - which drew the attention of several teachers, and the headmistress. I think I've just signed my own death warrant in terms of painting sets for school productions

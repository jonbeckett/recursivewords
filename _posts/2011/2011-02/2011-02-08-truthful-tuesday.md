I'm not usually one for memes, but have ten minutes to kill before the end of the day, and am unlikely to make much headway with anything new - having just returned from a meeting.

So what truth might I share?

I like people who are intelligent, but intensely dislike people who are either aloof, or advertise the fact that they might know more than others about a particular subject. You would never know if I either like or dislike you either.

I don't believe in talent. I believe in hard work, application, and having an interest in something. People say I am good at drawing - but that's mainly because I spent a good few years when I was young trying to draw things - because I liked drawing.

I love mathematics, but am not very good. There's a girl at work that I might very well put on a pedestal because she has a degree in math, and when questioned obviously loves the subject too. You would never know she has any of these skills or knowledge. I like that about her.

I love playing chess, but am pretty dreadful at it. I realised a long time ago that I'm never going to be a goodchess player, and I'm fine with that - especially if it means being the kind of nutjob I met when I visited a chess club once (the kind of people you never typically see, because they don't get out much).

It's heading towards 9am on my final day off from work, and I'm trying to wake up. The children are slowly appearing from their bedroom, stumbling through the house with theirpajamason - heading towards the lounge to watch Sponge Bob. I'm about to make a second cup of tea.

I finally got the chance to catch up with perhaps my longest standing and closest online friend last night. It made me realise how important it is to spend time with people you care about, and remind yourself why you are friends in the first place. We spent the evening sharing stories, laughing, drinking, eating rubbish (well - I ate rubbish), and basically smiling non stop. Good medicine when it so often feels like you've done nothing but tilt at windmills for months on end.

A couple of years ago I maintained a technical blog called "Bag of Spanners". It served as a notebook of bits and pieces of code I had figured out, and that I neatened up for the benefit of others. It ceased to exist some time ago (for reasons I might go into another time).

This morning I received an email from Google telling me they had charged me $10 to renew the domain name.

That will be the domain nameI don't own any more.

Somebody somewhere has realised they can make quite a bit of money at this Google is paying ENOM (domain registrar) my $10 for a domain held by somebody else, and ENOM is being incredibly difficult to contact (I suspect on purpose).

I can't even summon the will power at the moment to begin fighting with them over it. Maybe at the weekend. I'm not going to forget about it though.

The best bit? I can't shut down the Google Apps account connected to the domain I don't own any more either.

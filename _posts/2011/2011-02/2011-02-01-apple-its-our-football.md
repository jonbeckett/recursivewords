Has anybody else read the story breaking this morning about Apple changing the terms of the App Store? It looks like iPhone or iPad applications will no longer be able to sell products through the apps unless it comes from the App Store.

How STUPID is that?

It basically means an end to the Kindle App, and an end to any application working as a brochure to buy anything from.

Idiocy.

I'm just happy I no longer have an iPhone, or an Apple Mac computer. While the engineering of the software and hardware IS best in class, their business practices risk losing EVERYTHING they have worked so hard to build.

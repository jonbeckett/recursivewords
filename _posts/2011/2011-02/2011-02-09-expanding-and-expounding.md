Following the shift of my humble tumblog to it's own "proper" domain name - now amusing people at blog.jonbeckett.com - I thought I should perhaps fill in some pages; expand on the cursory about page I previously had.

Ladies and Gentlemen - I present you;

About A condensed history of my life, the universe, and everything

Contact All manner of methods by which you might distract and entertain me.

Links A goldmine for procrastinators everywhere.

Disclaimer The most entertaining disclaimer ever written. Now there'sa sweeping generalisation, if ever I saw one.

Well that's my lunchtime used up I guess I should try and amuse myself with some programming for the rest of the day

p.s. this is my 888th post on this platform. The numerologists out there will no doubt link this to the price of fish, the alignment of Jupiter, and the reason their phone was acting up this morning.

I've been thinking about doing this for some time. I've been writing a blog online since 2003 - first on my own script, and latterly on whichever blog platform was popular - losing readers each time I switched, but carrying on regardless.

Perhaps that's the theme - "carrying on regardless".

Anyway - it occurs to me that nobody is reallythat interested in reading the archive of a blog. When I look in on the Tumblr dashboard, I typically only look at the most recent posts by everybody - until I come across content that I've already seen. Other people may be different, but I'm betting they're not.

Given that Tumblr is at last turning a corner in terms of reliability and stability - and the amount of freedom they grant you in terms of coding your own templates - I'm seriously thinking about switching.

I used to think of Tumblr as a midde-ground between Twitter and WordPress, and it probably is - but given the other distractions in my life at the moment Tumblr is gradually usurping WordPress. I guess a part of it is a dawning realisation that long-form blogging as we have known it over the last 10 years (I'm talking about those writing journals - not niche magazine sites) is dying out. While a few of us still write blogs at WordPress, or Blogger, the audience is on the wane - and with no audience, there is no feedback.

Ah crap. I don't know what to do.I've been trying to sit on my hands about this for weeks.

Just because I have 7 years worth of blog posts, doesn't mean they have to be online. They were valuable at the time they were writtenin a cathartic capacity of sorts. I like to read and comment on what people are doing right now- not what they did in the past - so I'm betting they are probably the same.

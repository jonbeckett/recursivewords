The suckage amazes me. I just spent the best part of half an hour digging through random tags at the tumblweed website, checking ten blogs at a time to see if I could find anything interesting, original, and/or thought provoking. After checking perhaps a hundred of them, I only found perhaps five that were not filled with reblogs.

What is wrong with everybody? What happened to being original?

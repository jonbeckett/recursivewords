I was just reading a post by Stephie Hell about Karate Kid, and it got me thinking about "movie moments that stay with you". You know - the scenes that change you, or shape you as a person.

Here's a list off the top of my head - feel free to post your own.

The moment in Karate Kid where Mr Miyagi attacks Daniel after making him wash the decking and the cars, and he defends fearfully and perfectly.

The moment in Mr Holland's Opus when Gertrude Lang tells him in front of the school that"while you may not consider yourself rich, or famous, you would be wrong." - and goes on to present Glen Holland's "American Symphony", played by several generations of school orchestra musicians.

The moment in Forrest Gump where he asks Jenny if his son has special needs.

The moment in the directors cut of Close Encounters of the Third Kind where the press corner the mother of the abducted child, and reduce her to tears.

The moment in "The Notebook" when the older Allie dies, and James Garner doesn't know what to do.

The moment in Armageddon where the single mother points her son towards the television when the astronauts are presented live on TV for their likely fatal mission, and tells her son "that's your Daddy".

The moment in Chariots of Fire at the scottish trials when Eric Liddel's head tips back, and the famous music explodes from the speakers for the first time.

The moment in "You've Got Mail" when Meg Ryan tells Mr Fox "I hoped it was going to be you".

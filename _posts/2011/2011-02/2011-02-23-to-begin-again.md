Three thousand posts, seven years, multiple platforms, multiple technologies - all directed towards one rather ordinary goal : to delivery my thoughts to you via the words I write.

The flow of published words, thoughts and ideas nearly came to a crunching halt in early 2011 when I posted up an "On Hiatus" sign, and vanished off to the micro-blogs for a few weeks; the online equivalent of eloping with the art student girl who just moved in across the hallway.

It didn't last.

I'm back, I'm writing, and I think I have a plan of sorts this time - or rather the plan is a lack of a plan.I'm just going to be me, tilting at each day's windmills, sharing the thoughts and observations that occur to me. I'm not going to be controversial, and I'm not going to chase visitor numbers as so many SEO obsessed nutcases seem to.

I'm beginning again. The same but different. It's goingto be an awfully big adventure.

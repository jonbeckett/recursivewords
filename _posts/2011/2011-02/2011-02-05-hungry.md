Sat here waiting for better half to arrive home with her brother. They are picking up indian food on the way home from the pub.I haven't eaten since lunchtime, and it's just gone 9pm.

Hungry isn't quite the word for it. And I only just realised.

Do you ever do that? Pootle along doing whatever it is you're doing, and then suddenly realise you should probably have eaten hours ago? I'm terrible for forgetting to eat - usually while working on something on the computer - and then of course I eat junk because I'm starving.

I've ordered pan friend something or other - I should have written it down - that's something else I do, by the way, order food and then forget what I ordered.

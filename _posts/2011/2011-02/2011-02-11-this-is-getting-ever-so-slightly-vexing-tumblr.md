I edited the HTML of my tumblr theme earlier (to add site verification for the Bing Webmaster Tools), and it completely scrambled the contents of the custom property fields again.

I had toreconfigure the theme three timesbefore it started remembering the settings again. That meant looking up the logins for all the websites I'm a member of, digging out the background image (which Tumblr's Amazon S3 account now has about 8 copies of, because of this bug), and re-set all the configuration options for the theme.Not good.

If you're wondering what I was up to, I've added the sitemap XML files to Google and Bing to see if it increases traffic arriving at the blog. To verify you own a site, you typically have to either add a DNS record, or put a hidden code in the page. Bing only gives you the opportunity to hide a code - hence Tumblr fell over, smashed the theme up, and then sat on the floor crying for a while.

I could think of better things to do than fight with bugs in Tumblr's infrastructure.

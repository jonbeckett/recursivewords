I spent most of yesterday afternoon fighting the worst headache I've had in quite some time. While cycling home I had to get off my bike and walk because I thought I might pass out.

I stopped in town to buy food for dinner - having promised to cook dinner for everybody for Valentines Day. On arriving home I had to leave all the shopping on the drive while I moved our children's scooters that had been dumped in the alleyway down the side of the house. Having arrived home at 6, we didn't actually sit down to eat until 9, basically because if I hadn't washed the fridge out, done all the washing up, and cleaned the kitchen we would probably all have food poisoning by now.

In the middle of the kitchen carnage, the week's shopping arrived, which I put away.

Just to top it off, we are both ill W went to work this morning coughing her lungs up, and I have now had headaches for three days.

Some Valentines Day.

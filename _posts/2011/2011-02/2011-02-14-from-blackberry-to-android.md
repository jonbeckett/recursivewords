Following my Blackberry going missing at the swimming pool this weekend, I did some mental arithmetic and figured out the cost of a new contract was less than the cost of a new handset - so jumped handset, network provider, and contract to an HTC Desire, running Android 2.2 (soon to be 2.3), on O2.

It's going to be hard this early to have any real opinions of the phone - I'm a perfect case for Android because I use Google Mail, Calendar, Contacts, and so on. HTC is also a good fit because they've extended Android to integrate tightly with Twitter and Facebook - which I also use.

After a little under a day with the new handset, I do have some observations though;

Android is very flexible - more so than the iOS, and incomparibly so compared to the Blackberry OS.

Android has more to learn about than iOS - purely because of it's flexibility.

The touch keyboard in Android is not as easy to use as the one in iOS.

It's wonderful to have goodapplications again

The only thing I'm really missing at the moment is a "to do list" app. The iPhone had a plethora of them - and while there are a few on Android, I guess I need to read some reviews before picking one (in all likelihood it will be one that integrates with Google Tasks).

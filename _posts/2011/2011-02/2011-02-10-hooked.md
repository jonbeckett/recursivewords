Damn you, people of the internet, what have you done to my brain?

Woke up this morning, silenced radio alarm clock (and got told off for switching off Wham), picked up the Blackberry, and checked my email.

Inbetween making lunches for the children, and persuading them to get ready for school (threats work quite well), opened browser on desktop machine, and checked Tumblr briefly.

Waved goodbye to kids and updated podcasts on MP3 player before leaving the house (my daily dose of Tech News Today, and Buzz Out Loud).

Arrived a little early for work, so headed to Twitter, and the exploits of those I follow.

On an off while doing work this morning, tabbed into Tumblr, refreshed the feed, and had a quick scan of any updates.

Because most of the people I follow are on the other side of the planet - I don't get many updates to follow during the day. This is a good thing - otherwise I wouldn't get anything done.

Why do you all have to be so awesome?

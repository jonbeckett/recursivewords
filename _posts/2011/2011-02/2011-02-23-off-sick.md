As predicted, the cold arrived during the night with several big lads, and has set about extracting as much snot as possible during the day so far - often accompanied by sneezing, coughing, and generally feeling like something rather unpleasant.

I just jumped in the shower to see if it helped at all. I now smell better, but feel pretty much the same as I did.

Here's hoping my body does it's usual magic trick and wages high temperature war with whatever virus has attempted an invasion.

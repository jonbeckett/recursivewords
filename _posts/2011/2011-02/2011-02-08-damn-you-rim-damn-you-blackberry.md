My crappy Blackberry crashed this morning after inviting me to update the app store on it. It was the sort of crash that you can't recover from and luckily (due to my own paranoia) I had backed the entire damn thing up a minute before.

After re-installing the entire phone (it's the only way of getting out of this particular bug), I find that Google Maps no longer works, and reinstalling it doesn't fix it either. Of course the phone has also forgotten the logins for everything, and semi-randomly shuffled the application icons.

How the hell do RIM / Blackberry get away with it? I've lived in fear of this rubbish phone crashing for months - knowing a re-install is the only escape route each time it happens. Updating any apps on it is a game of Russian Roulette.

Did I mention that the holster inexplicably drains the battery too? If you put the phone in it's protective cover, it loses charge at an alarming rate - if you just keep the phone in your pocket, it happily lives for days.

Fail. Is anybody listening from RIM? Huge Fail. At the first opportunity I get (as soon as I can afford it), I'm switching to an Android handset. Anything must be better than this piece of crap.

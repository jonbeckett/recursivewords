Astronauts landing on Venus encounter dangerous exotic creatures and almost meet some sexy Venusian women who like to sunbathe in hip-hugging skin-tight pants and seashell bras.

While flicking through channels on TV earlier, happened upon a B Movie called "Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women". Funniest synopsis I've ever seen on IMDB, and scarily accurate from the few moments of the movie I saw.

Who knew they had lycra and bikinis in prehistory?

Tonight was one of those nights when swimming was probably an easier method of getting home from work than cycling. The rain didn't so much as fall, as permeate my entire being.

I slopped through the back door of our house, and basically undressed on the spot - making room on the radiator alongside me for my waterproofs (yeah, right), and the clothes I had worn underneath them.

My socks made satisfyingly loud slap noises as they flopped over the radiator

The worst thing about cycling in heavy rain? Not the water that's falling - more the water that's bouncing back up off the road. Some of it finds it's way into your mouth.

I had a shower immediately, brushed my teeth, and had a coffee, but I can still taste the road.

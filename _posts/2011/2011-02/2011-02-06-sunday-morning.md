It's 9am, the kids are fed, the TV is pumping some kind of rubbish at them across the lounge, I'm showered, washed, shaved, teeth brushed, dressed (if you can call the Smurf Nerd t-shirt "dressed"), and all seems to be well with the world.

As has become usual around here, Sunday is going to be filled with washing clothes, ironing, tidying up, and all those exciting kinds of things.

I still haven't been out for a run. I think I mentioned yesterday - the running shoes I ordered on the internet were not big enough apparently "New Balance" are more than an entire size smaller than every other shoe I have ever bought. Go figure. I'm considering getting Asics (which I used to own), but agree with friends about them; they tend to feel like you're running in flippers.

Ho hum.

Just listening to "This Week in Tech" - they are talking about Egypt dropping off the internet last week while it's government tried to destroy it's own people's ability to communicate with each other. Throughout the entire news story over recent weeks I have been purposely "not having an opinion". It's kind of professional suicide, for the same reason as speaking out about Wikileaks might be.

I guess a part of it is having a young family, and being the main breadwinner. I cannot risk putting our income at risk. For almost the same reasons I will never again jump from a perfectly working aircraft (yep, been there - done that), I will not express opinions about controversial news stories.

It's one of the many new suits of clothes you have to learn to become comfortable in once you have a family "being responsible", "being safe", "being consistent", and "quietly getting on with it"

After failing conspicuously to get out of bed this morning early enough to go for a run, I managed to escape at about 8:30pm for a couple of miles running through town.

Something odd happened while out running a couple of other runners approached behind me, ran behind me for a while like they wanted to get past (but didn't) - then once in the high street raced past me I thought "oh well they must be much faster than me - and this is only my second time out running in years".

They then crossed the road, and doubled up, both knackered

Why? Why do that?

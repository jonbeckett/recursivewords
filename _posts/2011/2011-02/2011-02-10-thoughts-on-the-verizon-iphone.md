I've been reading the news story about the Verizon iPhone with interest over the last few weeks - and wondering why huge swathes of America went down the route of CDMA mobile networks.

If you have no idea what I'm talking about, it boils down to this - a Verizon iPhone will pretty much only work in the US. This isn't because of anything to do with network business agreements - it's to with hardware compatibility.

Nearly the entire rest of the world uses the GSM standard for mobile communications hardware - meaning we can wander from country to country and our handset will workregardless of the network we are within range of. We take it for granted.

I'm wondering how many CDMA iPhones Apple can sell - and I'm betting Verizon had to pay them a lot of money to build a CDMA model because they can't sell it anywhere else.

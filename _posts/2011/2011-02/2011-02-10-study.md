Our study smells. Not of anything particularly bad - it just smells. Of dust. The old room smell that happens if windows are not opened often, and nobody "lives" in the room.

I mentioned it to my better half yesterday, and by magic several oil burners appeared on the desk this evening from the darker corners of the household, along with some essential oils.

I would like to tell you the room now smells of rainbows, and unicorns, and summer meadows. In reality, it smells like the perfume counter of a department store.

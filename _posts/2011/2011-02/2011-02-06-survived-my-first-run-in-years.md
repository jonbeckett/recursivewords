In spite of the new running shoes turning up and being too small, I dug my old ones out (which are destroyed, but still), and figured it wouldn't hurt to run a couple of miles on them.

I didn't warm up, and didn't stretch beforehand. Just slipped some shorts on, a hoody, the shoes, and headed out into town. I ran about 2 miles, didn't walk once, started too fast, and paid for it after about a mile - I'll put that down to the novelty factor.

Main thing to take away? I'm running again, and I survived.I'm guessing the plan at the moment will be to try and run a couple of times a week at least.

It's been too long since I last emptied my head into the blog. Work, life, chores, and children seem to have been chewing me up and spitting me out in small pieces recently.

There was a time when I wrote long meandering think pieces. A time when I wrote at length about the happenings of the day, my thoughts, and my opinions. Perhaps it's time for a return. I suppose a return to introspection of sorts.

I read a wonderful post by Inmi earlier today about the need to write, and it reminded me of the reason I have often found myself writing. Take this evening for example; I have nothing specific to write about - but here I am, thundering across the keyboard as darkness falls across the land, filling the otherwise blank screen with my words.

They say nature abhors avacuum. Maybe the same is true of my word processor. If not writing here, I would no doubt be holed up somewhere comfortable with a notebook and a pen. I don't really "do" television any more; if given the choice I will always choose the internet, and will choose interaction over presented entertainment. I've seen enough funny cat videos (our eldest daughter would no doubt claim that there is no such thing as "enough funny cat videos").

During the two years I worked in central London - surviving 4 hours on trains each day - I read books, and perhaps more importantly I wrote. A small stack of Moleskine notebooks bears testimony to that time in my life, and will be shared with my children when they are older - as the blog posts also will no doubt. The words will afford them a chance to know me as I was then.

The words we write - the words we share - will let future generations connect with us after we are gone. My great great grandchildren will be able to read about this quirky guy who rode a bike to work, and programmed the computers like they have in the museum to do insanely boring things. Those stories will not age well.

They will also read about family life, bringing up children, relationships, food, art, books, music, and so many other things that will age well - that will still relate.

What am I saying?

Our words will live on after we are gone. We should make more effort to record the things we care about, the things we find interesting, the things that make us happy, and the things that make us sad. We should record the big things and the little things. The little things are always the good stuff.

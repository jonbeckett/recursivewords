The Tumblr theme bugs resurfaced this morning and destroyed the theme I was using.

The Tumblr mobile app will not let me post photos

Photo posts sent in as emails are getting truly bizarre post dates - often queued for hours, although people appear to be able to see them in the dashboard.

I've had enough of it.

I'm re-wiring things at my end to continue using Tumblr, but in no more capacity than a social network - in the same way as I might use Facebook. I love the community here, and I will still love visiting to see how everybody is doing, what they are up to, and to share photos, thoughts, and idiot ideas.

I just can't trust any of the infrastructure enough to house my own blog here - which is a HUGE shame. I had been hoping - with the advent of the big Fashion Week push that the engineers at Tumblr Towers had been working on resolving a lot of the problems while they seemed to have cured the scalability issues, there are problems in just about every other direction.

I just want somewhere simple to write, to share, and to relyon for the journal type posts. In all likelihood I'll resurrect WordPress on my own webspace (blog.wordpress.com) - but that will mean playing the propogation game over the next 48 hours or so and back-filling a months worth of stuff from Tumblr.

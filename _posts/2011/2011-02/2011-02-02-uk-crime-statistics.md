The police in the UK launched a website yesterday showing up-to-date instances of crime right down to street level. Interesting to see that there's one hotspot in the town; a road with 15 "crimes" in December alone - I pass by the road every evening on the way home from work it's no surprise at all.

I'm guessing the "Other Crime" category - given the affluent nature of the town - is people wearing fake Ug boots, or something similar.

And you think I'm joking.

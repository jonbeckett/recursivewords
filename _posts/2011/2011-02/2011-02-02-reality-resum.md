A fantastically stupid idea occurred to me this morning, and would make a pretty good meme. Write yourself a "real" list of skills for yourself.

Here's mine;

Can leap small dogs in a single bound

Faster than a child on a skateboard

Able to drink quite a lot of wine without having a hangover

Can sometimes stand on one leg while putting socks on

Very good at eating pizza

Able to take no notice of very loud background noise (I'm a parent)

Good at count-down style threats with small children

Excellent at washing up, but may give outward impression of being grumpy while completing task

World class procrastination abilities

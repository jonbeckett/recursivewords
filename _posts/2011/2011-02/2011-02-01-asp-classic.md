Warning: this post contains geeky stuff. To ward off sudden attacks of narcolepsy, look away now.

For the next month or so I'm working on a development project using ASP Classic - originally known as plain old "Active Server Pages". It's going to be very strange, rewinding my head back to procedural programming, and HTML with inline code. I worked on this project perhaps six years ago, and have been called back in to extend it one of the few guys here with the experience to do it (the other guy is probably falling off his chair laughing about that).

Kind of nice, in a nuts and bolts way though - programming like this is somehow more direct; you change the source, you check the results in the browser. No compilation, deployment, and app pool recycling to think about

Well not really "secrets" as such - I don't really do "secrets" - I'm pretty much an open book. More a case of "things people don't know, and that don't crop up in general conversation".

When I was young, I never really "fitted in". I was shy, gawky, nerdy - add any number of those kinds of terms together.

At college, and my first few jobs, I still didn't fit in; I was always a best friend of the women I knew, but none of them ever looked at me as anything more.

At some point - maybe mid 20s? Everything changed. In the space of about two years I "grew up", and had more girlfriends than I should perhaps admit. Real, proper girlfriends (I know that sounds amusing, but it wasa hugething for me at the time)

When I began working in London a couple of years ago, I got to talking with some of the guys in the development team, and they couldn't believe that most of my friends - both in the real world, and on the internet - were women. It amazed me that none of them had anyfemale friends all except the head of the department, who described me as "a bit alternative" one day (this was back when I had long hair)

I used to have long hair almost forgot that one!

This is where everybody asks to see a photo of me with long hair, isn't it

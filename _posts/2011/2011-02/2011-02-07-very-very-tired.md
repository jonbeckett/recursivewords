Sat up watching the Superbowl until the beginning of the fourth quarter. I guessed when Pittsburgh got intercepted that they had no chance, and was proven right when I woke up this morning.

I think I finally fell into bed at about 2am.Holy crap I'm tired.

Legs felt fine this morning (after the 2 mile run yesterday), but sitting down for any length of time seems to turn them into concrete. Typical case of DOMS (Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness) - caused by not running for several years, and then instructing my poor legs to carry me all over town at speed. It would appear cycling muscles and running muscles don't get on well.To be honest, I expected some stiffness this week. Once I get a few more miles under my belt my legs will be fine.

Work is quiet today. Slowly plodding through a long(ish) project, that will carry on for several weeks. Expect inane posts (such as this one) over the next few weeks.

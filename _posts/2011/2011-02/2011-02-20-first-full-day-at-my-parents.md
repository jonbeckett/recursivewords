We are in the south west of England for a few days (we travel home Tuesday night) visiting my parents. The plan wasto do nothing for a few days. That will be why I went for a really hard run this morning.

Not hard as in "I ran fast" more hard in the sense that I ran down to the sea and back. This wouldn't be so bad if they didn't live 400ft above sea level so the mile and a half down towards the sea is downhill most of the way, and the mile and a half back is leg destroying uphill.

Luckily for me I have far bigger legs than most runners - the product of cycling 6 miles every working day), so running uphill isn't so much a power problem for me, as a lung problem. I went slowly though, and surprised myself with being able to keep going.

As much as I would love to run again tomorrow, I know I can't - in reality it's been three years since I was last running regularly, and your body doesn't get back into it thatquickly.

The rest of today was spent visiting Trago Mills - quite possibly the most strange place in the known world. Think shopping mall meets flea market meets garage sale. It's huge, it's busy, bust most importantly to us IT'S CHEAP. We bought everything for our next children's birthday party, and the kids blew their holiday money.

In other news, we're off to visit perhaps my closest friend tomorrow - really looking forward to catching up. Will hopefully take lots of embarassing photos of toothy grins and hugs.

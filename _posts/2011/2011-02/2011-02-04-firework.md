While cycling in to work this morning, Katy Perry's "Firework" was blasting into my ears, and I thought about a friend who mentioned the church he goes to sang Firework recently.

I started grinning to myself.

Quite apart from the annoyance that church going people like to try and claim anything and everything as their own, take over anything and everything (you know, like EASTER), and/or apply hidden meaning to all sorts of things, something else occurred to me.

I wondered how many of the people in that church know about the rest of the album? The songs about having sex all summer long, having threesomes, getting drunk for the fun of it, or asking to see a guy's "peacock" repeatedly

Like I said - I couldn't help grinning.

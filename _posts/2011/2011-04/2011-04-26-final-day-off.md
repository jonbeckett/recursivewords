It's my final day off work today. While I would like to kick back and do as little as possible, reality is dictating otherwise. The presence of three little people in the house is having a siesmic impact on any plans.

W returned to work this morningit's an "inset" day at school, meaning planning, letters to new parentsthat kind of thing. I think she was secretly happy to get away from the kids for a few hours. As much as we love them to bits, they do drain you after the thousandth "MuuuUUUUmmm", or "DaaAAAddd" They need to go back to school.

A typical day around here pretty much runs itselfI won't bother listing the enumerable things that happen every day, but you can probably imagine. It's funnywhen we first had the children we had read all the stuff about "routine", and it's importance for the development of the kids. The reality is that it's not about the children at allit's about remaining sane, and getting anything done at all.

Since starting to use Posterous as a blogging platform, I've been thinking about doing two things; Bringing the various auto-post destinations under one name Putting a clear line between "Jonathan Beckett : Blogger", and "Jonathan Beckett : Husband, Father, Colleague, School Friend, etc" To do it, I've made sure Posterous, Tumblr, WordPress and Blogger all have the same "name" " that being the "blog" identity, as follows; farflungfriend.posterous.com " the source of the blog posts farflungfriend.tumblr.com " autoposted from posterous farflungfriend.blogspot.com " autoposted from posterous farflungfriend.wordpress.com " autoposted from posterous I will still exist as "jonbeckett" at twitter and facebook, where I want people to most easily find me by my name; twitter.com/jonbeckett facebook.com/jonbeckett Hopefully this all makes sense! One of the nice things about retaining a WordPress blog in some shape or form is that it has the blog posts going back to the start " 2003 " when I began the blogging journey.

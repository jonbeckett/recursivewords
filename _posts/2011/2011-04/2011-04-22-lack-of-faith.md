One of my favourite bloggers wrote a fantastic post crossing through online bullying, Lady Gaga, Easter, religion, and any number of other explosive subjects recently, and she did so while expertly walking the knife edge between informed debate and inflamatory invective. I find the subject of religion so hard to write about that I almost always avoid it. If I write anything of substance about my lack of faith, I will be considered purposely argumentative. If I back any explored thoughts up with the numerous books I've read around the subject I will be considered aloof. It's the age old argument about pleasing some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time only in the case of publishing words on a public forum, you strangle your true train of thought to avoid offending a tiny minority that will claim the majority as their peers, and expend inordinate time and energy constructing spite and bile to counter your views, opinions, and self. Perhaps one day I will set out my stall for all to read. Doing so will pitch me into an argument I have systematically avoided for years. An argument I could easily win, but will do so by belittling the beliefs of those I know and like so much, and that's the same reason that will prevent me from having it. Even this view will be considered aloof by many.

I find myself in the strange position of having run out of work to do this afternoon, and not having enough time to start anything. In an hour or so I will be leaving the office and not returning for the best part of a week. Close friends have remarked today that it's been too long since I had time off " and the resulting change in me today has been noticeable " even through instant message conversations. Tomorrow morning we will head to Legoland, about an hour's drive away with the children, armed with packed lunches, good humour, hopefully the sun, and as much good spirit as we can muster. It's the first time they will have been to a big theme park " I'll be armed with the camera throughout the day to capture the smiles, the laughter, and their eyeballs leaving their sockets. The rest of my time off " which includes the Easter weekend " is going to be spent doing as little as possible. I might even get back out and try and assess my fitness " see if I'm going to have any hope of doing the local 5 mile running race in early May. I would have been fine if I hadn't had cold after cold for the best part of eight weeks. It's been a nightmare. Anyway. An hour to go.

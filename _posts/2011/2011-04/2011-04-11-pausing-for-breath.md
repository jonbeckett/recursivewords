This afternoon I find myself approaching a rare situation indeedthe work required for a client demo mid-week is functionally complete, and fairly well polishedmeaning I have a rare thing on my handsspare time. That being said, I'm waiting for a virtual machine to start up in order to complete a random objective thrown at me yesterday.

All of this is being done without any kind of "to do" listI'm not quite sure how, because normally I am the most absent minded person in the known universe. Perhaps stress is a wonderful aid memoire ?I actually went as far as removing the task list app I bought for my phone this morning, because I realised I wasn't using it. Evernote has replaced it for the moment not sure I'll even use that though; I've fallen out of the habit of writing things down and blogging and catching up with friends Here's looking forwards to Wednesday, or rather the aftermath of itand the opportunity to slow down a little afterwards; maybe take a few days offrecharge batteries. Perhaps then I'll remember I used to have a few friends, and set about catching up with them.

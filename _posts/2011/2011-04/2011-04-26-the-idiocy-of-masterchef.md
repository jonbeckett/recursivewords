I'm half watching this idiotic TV show we have here in the UK called "Masterchef", where aspiring chefs compete to find out who's the best. The series started with many cooks competing in a knockout format, and is now down to the last three. They have toured the world, worked in famous restaurants in major cities and cooked with world famous chefs. Tonight got really, really ridiculous though. One of the courses had something like 25 stages in it's preparation they might as well have been pickling Rhino farts, broiling monkey spit, and coating gnome cutlets with spiced Pteradacyl egg shavings serious, it was ridiculous. How would a restaurant ever make any money from a single course that takes 7 hours to prepare? Multiply that by three for three courses, and you've just cost the restaurant 21 hours to feed a few people for a couple of hours. Take into account the skills required for that level of stupidity, and the cost would be astronomical. I guess the people who are willing to pay astronomical prices for hilariously poncified food can go ahead and buy it. I would much rather give that money to people who cannot afford to feed their family. The world has gone mad.

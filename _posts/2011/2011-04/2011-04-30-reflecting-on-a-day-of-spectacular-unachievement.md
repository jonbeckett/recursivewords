I have written nothing of substance for several days now, and have felt no inclination to do so. Not exactly the words that should be leaving the keyboard of somebody who's been blogging for 8 years I'm sat here late on Saturday night drinking a bottle of Sol (rather lovely Mexican beer) that I found at the back of the fridge, half taking an interest in W playing "Neverwinter Nights 2C/3 that I bought for her on the laptop. I warned her that playing it will turn her into Amy Farrah Fowler. She's currently ranting about the combat being unfair. We've switched the television off " there's only so much Royal Wedding mania a normal person can withstand. Beyond "didn't Catherine's dress look lovely", and the thousandth tweet about Pippa Middleton's "fantastic arse", it's all becoming a little bit recursive. p.s. I did nothing today, and it was great. I thoroughly recommend it as a lifestyle choice. Of course doing nothing doesn't really mean nothing " I still washed up, tidied up, ended arguments, and all the usual "Dad" duties, but otherwise nothing.

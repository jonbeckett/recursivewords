"Come on girls... time to watch the Royal Wedding" "Why?""Because two or three of these will happen in your entire life - and this one happens in ten minutes."The little ones raced after me immediately. Within ten minutes we had every little girl for hourses around crammed on the couch in our living room. I should have taken photos, but I was watching too. The rest of the day has been more fun than many of us can remember. We had lived here for 10 years, and only met a couple of neighbours. We have now met most of them (save for one who was determined in explaining in their rant of an essay that there was no community on the green, never had been, and wished us all ill for daring do anything... some people!). In reality of course, today was for the children. I think almost without exception the families that turned out for the picnic were those with small children - many of which already knew each other through school. A day to remember hopefully for decades to come. See the full gallery on Posterous

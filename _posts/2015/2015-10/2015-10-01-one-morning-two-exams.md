An email arrived in my work email box just before I left yesterday afternoon, announcing that one of the technologies I am a so-called "expert" at now had certification exams available. This morning I arrived in the office, found the email, and did both the "pro", and "admin" exams back-to-back. I now have two more certificates to shove in the drawer, and to add to the list on LinkedIn. I didn't revise for either exam, and now find myself wondering why I bothered even doing them. It's all a gigantic pissing competition really, isn't it.

In other news, I have to leave early today to pick our youngest up from school - my other half has flu (or at least I think it's flu). She's been off work all week so far, and isn't showing any signs of getting better. We were supposed to be going to a school fundraising event over the weekend - I'm guessing that's gone out of the window now. After that I will be taking each of our daughters to and from dance classes throughout the evening. I can't really complain about losing my evenings because when I am away with work my other half has to deal with exactly the same stuff.

Last night was particularly ridiculous - I left work a little early to pick up Miss 11 from hockey practice, walked across town with her to buy groceries, walked home, made dinner for everybody, and then ate mine in about two minutes before racing back out of the door to drop Miss 10 at football practice. While she was on the pitch I walked back into town and went grocery shopping for a second time - this time to get deodorant for our eldest, who was threatening to go nuclear over it (don't ask). After that I walked back to the football ground, picked up Miss 10, took her home, washed up, tidied up, and then collapsed in a heap. While I was out with Miss 10, my other half took Miss 11 to Guides, and brought her back - not the best idea with flu - she went straight to bed the moment she came in.

We are slowly but surely grinding ourselves into the ground. When I was a kid I never did any after school clubs at all - our kids do something or other virtually every night. Hell - even the mornings are fair game at the moment - our youngest goes into school early to do an extra maths session on the computers. It's never ending.

I'm now watching the clock at work, wondering how best to spend the remains of my lunchtime. Catching up on blogs wouldn't be such a bad idea...

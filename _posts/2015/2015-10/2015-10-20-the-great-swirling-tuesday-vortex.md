I got parachuted into somebody else's project today. I was supposed to "make changes", but ended up re-writing the whole damn thing in order to get a handle on any of it. It didn't help that the Star Wars trailer appeared on the internet early this morning, so of course I sat and watched that in the few minutes between the morning wall-of-death breakfast and lunch making routine, and leaving the house to cycle to work.

From the moment I arrived in the office, until the moment I looked at the clock and realised everybody else had already left, I just sat at my desk and fought with source code. I started to get somewhere late in the day, but most of the day was one huge frustrating slog. Picking up other developers code is never easy - especially when you do things very differently than them (that's the politically correct way of saying something else entirely).

Anyway.

It's just gone 10pm. I just watched the second episode of "Mr Robot" on the television. It's rare these days for me to watch anything - I'm liking it so far. It's different. I've grown tired of all the formulaic TV shows that the kids tend to watch. Our eldest started watching "No Ordinary Family" a few weeks ago (yet another Superhero series), and I made some comment about it being no different than any of the other superhero series.

"What do you mean?"

"They get powers, then some super-baddie turns up and they fight them in increasingly implausible situations week after week".

She told me to go away, because she knew I was right.

Talking about Superheroes, the comic books our youngest bought in London are propped on the desk in the study. I need to take a look at them. An OCD part of me is already annoyed - although the Superman book is "volume 1", it doesn't have the origin story in it. Maybe Superman never had an origin story in the comic books? Maybe it was added after? I have no idea. It doesn't help that the entire story of most comic books has been re-written again and again in a variety of parallel universes. The stories I always think of from my childhood as often referred to as the "Golden Age" - then they started re-booting series, and re-inventing characters left, right, and centre. I'm only just finding out about this, and it makes the various stories and characters almost impenetrable.

Christina Aguilera just came on the radio. Or Spotify, I guess. I listen to it in the browser, because the desktop app is the most bloated, evil mess in the known universe. Scratch that - iTunes wins that crown. I used to carefully rip and curate MP3s of all my CDs, and have a huge collection stored on an external hard drive, but never bother with any of it any more - I either listen to podcasts, internet radio, or Spotify.

I guess this has been a random post about nothing in particular. If you made it this far, you deserve a medal.

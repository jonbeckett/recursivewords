After getting the children into bed, clearing the kitchen, and finally sitting down yesterday evening, we discovered there was nothing on the television, so pressed the little button on the remote that turns the TV into "Amazon Fire TV". After a few minutes flicking through the various movies available, I randomly picked a movie I had heard nothing about. You might call it a methodsometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

We seem to be on something of a "little known movie" journey at the moment. I guess a huge part of that is my tendency to walk in the opposite direction to the crowd on purposeto find my own routeto make my own discoveries. We discovered the wonderful movies "The Lunchbox", and "L'Homme du Train" through similar means.

I'm not going to write at length about the plot or characters of "The Hundred Foot Journey", aside from saying that the cast was excellent, and now I want to find out what else they have been in. Om Puri in particular (as the patriarch of the Indian family) towered over the ensemble cast. A movie critic wrote that she could quite happily watch him grouching at a bus-stop. I can't help but agree.

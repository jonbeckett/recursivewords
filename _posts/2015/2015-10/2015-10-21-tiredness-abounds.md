After being parachuted into yet another project at work today with no prior knowledge, I left early to attend our middle daughter's first parents evening at "Big School" (notice the caps for emphasis). After cycling home like a madman I walked in, stripped to the waist, sprayed myself with deodorant, and pulled on a fresh t-shirt. After combing my hair I turned to my other half and asked if she was ready to go. She laughed.

Miss Eleven is doing famously at school. We are so proud of her - and strangely curious as to why she reserves such anger and histrionics for bedtime, given that her teachers all think the world of her. Parents evenings at school are interesting, because you bump into the same old faces that you always see at school events, and it's always a bit awkward. You "know" them, but you don't really know them at all. You know each other to say "hello" as you pass each other, but that's about it.

I passed one guy this evening - a fellow developer - that by all rights I should be friends with, and yet I'm not. We camped next to each other on the school field years ago, and his ex-wife lives across the green from us (I wouldn't recognise her if she walked into me - I just know she lives over there). We saw each other tonight - and no doubt he knows who I am too, but we somehow studiously ignored each other. Ships passing in the night.

I bumped into an old friend tonight, who's daughter is in the same year as ours at school. I was somewhat surprised to see him - I always imagined his children would be packed off to private school, or to the Grammar school up the road. I remember once having an interesting conversation with him where he defended being an elitist, and I shut down mid-conversation, appalled at many of his views. While talking to him briefly tonight between teacher's briefings, I sensed something wasn't right - I need to invite him out for a drink or something.

In other news, I just drank a glass of wine - the first in several weeks (I'm still coughing) - and it's gone straight to me head. I'm tempted to get another one, and to go sit and watch the next episode of "Mr Robot", but have too many other things to get on with... and sitting here writing this isn't going to get them done.

Since scraping myself out of bed at 8am, I've been caught up in an endless round of "stuff". I just sat down for the first time with a cup of tea, and it's somehow 11am. How does that even happen ?

The washing machine is running (again), the tumble dryer is running (again), the dishes are washed (again), the kitchen is tidy (again), the lounge is somewhat tidy (again), and the younger kids have gone off with my other half for the day. Our eldest hasn't surfaced from her pit yet. I was going to try and talk her into going shopping with me for clothes and stuff, but I'm not sure I can face the look of disgust the idea will be met with.

The "better" desktop computer in the study - the one the kids rely on for homework and so on - is busy doing the upgrade to Windows 10 as I type this. I kicked it off last night, and then took a look this morning - I'm guessing it sat on the "I'm ready to start upgrading" dialog for long enough that it lost it's patience, and failed the whole damn thing. I kicked it off again this morning, and it's currently 10% through the upgrade. Knowing my luck we will have a power failure and the entire computer will lunch itself.

We have to keep at least one copy of Windows in the house for the kids to use, so they have something that looks like the computers they encounter at school. I will admit to being incredibly bitter that it has to have Microsoft Office on it too - if I had my way, all kids would be shown Libre Office instead of Microsoft Office. I have been sorely tempted in the past when emails arrive from school with Microsoft Word documents attached to email them back and state "we do not have a copy of Microsoft Office installed - what are we supposed to do with this?". It really stuns me when we get marketing materials through at work in Word format. PDF was invented for a reason...

I've never upgraded to Windows 10 on a computer yet - I've always re-formatted the machine, and started with a clean slate (it tends to lead to a far, far better outcome and affords the opportunity to re-think things). I guess we'll see what happens. All I know is, I need to make sure it all works before anybody uses it again or there will be hell to pay.

My other half called a few minutes ago - asking me to transfer money into the current account so she could fill the car up (we have two bank accounts - we live out of the "current" account, which we run to empty each month). The internet banking interface only works in Internet Explorer (don't get me started about that), so I had to find a computer that would work - given that mine runs Ubuntu Linux, and the kids computer was upgrading, the only option was her laptop - which of course was as flat as a pancake, and in the middle of Windows Updates. Booting it up took quarter of an hour. It re-booted twice.

The Windows 10 upgrade is showing 75% complete now. Time to go make a cup of tea, and then come back and see what kind of disaster I am facing...

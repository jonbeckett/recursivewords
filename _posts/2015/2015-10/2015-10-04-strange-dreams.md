It's unusual that I remember dreams for more than a few moments after I wake upbut this morning the bizarre story concocted by my unsupervised mind was perhaps a little more strange than normalI can remember vast swathes of it.

There is a green outside our housea green on which you might find children playing football after school come rain or shine. In the dream, there was somebody playing with a motorised kite (yes, you read right). It appeared to be able to do aerobatics under it's own power, and not tangle it's own strings. After watching it swoop around the sky for a few moments, the pilot (a young boy, stood with his father) lost control, and it crashed at the foot of a team of technicians building two mobile homes on the green.

I had not noticed the mobile homes before.

I wandered over, and discovered that they were being set-up by the local radio station for some kind of outside broadcast. Both were bolted together, to make one large square building. I wandered inside, and quickly realised that they were intended for some kind of reality television showwith couches, tables, and so on spread throughout.

A friend from the internet that I have never met in the "real" world was sitting in one of the roomswe talked for a few moments (I forget about what), and then I carried on wandering around. In perhaps the biggest roomthe loungeI found a girl I used to work with, sitting alone at a table. We both smiled, and she asked why I never post anything personal or interesting on Twitter.

A few moments later the room had filled with an assortment of people I know from all walks of life, and I was taking a photo of them all crammed onto the couches from the other side of the roomexcept the camera app on my phone wouldn't focus properly on themsomething was obscuring the lenswhen I checked there was nothing there.

And then I woke up.

While brushing my teeth a few minutes later, I played the events of the dream over in my head, and realised that the principal people I talked to in the dream were those I have lost touch with over the years.

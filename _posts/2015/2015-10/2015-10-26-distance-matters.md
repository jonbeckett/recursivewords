I sometimes wish I knew more people on the internet that at least live in the same timezone as mehell, the same side of the planet would be better than the limbo I surround myself with at the moment. While writing a blog is a wonderful escapeemptying your head into the keyboard in order to connect with relative strangersit can also be lonely.

Of course I haven't got off my backside and looked for anybody yetI'm essentially complaining that the world hasn't fallen at my feet.

It would just be nice to share the work day, or the quiet moments of the weekend or evening with somebody a little closer. Invariably I end up swapping messages as I fall asleep, and far flung friends wake up. Because we are all so distant, it also means there is kind of a wall in any friendship I might make. Distance really does matter sometimes.

Do you ever wonder what on earth you're doing with your life? I sometimes do. It often feels like I'm on some kind of gigantic treadmill, churning out the steps - one foot in front of the other - again, and again, and again. Thud, thud, thud. Every week day, and every weekend seems to be the same at the moment.

While running here, there, and everywhere doing who the hell knows what, I occasionally catch a glimpse of others out with friends, or sitting quietly in a cafe, or just out for a walk with their dog. While I don't really feel bitter about their perceived freedom, I do feel envious sometimes.

I guess there are two sides to every story though - the quiet person I see in a cafe may be lonely. The guy out walking his dog... maybe that dog is his entire world. Maybe I shouldn't feel so bad about being in the middle of a noisy, busy, hectic, chaotic family?

In other news, I just went through all the Loot Crate boxes, and sorted the contents into "I want", and "the kids can have". They will be getting the badges, toys, and various collectibles over the next few weeks as surprise presents when they do something good. We often ask the kids "if you clean your room, I'll get you something nice" - well maybe the something nice can be a trinket from the secret stash, rather than a chocolate bar.

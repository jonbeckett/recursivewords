A little while ago, while wandering the world wide web late one evening, I struck up conversation with an old friend. She commented that it often feels like your voice is lost on the internet - that the deafening roar of the masses will drown yours out - that you will never be heard - that the publication of our thoughts, ideas, and dreams is ultimately futile.

The pessimist in me wants to agree with her.

The optimist (which always defeats the pessimist - I'm that kind of idiot) tells me to stand tall, and shout louder - to continue tilting at windmills. When judged against the words and pictures posted by the famous, our contribution is forgettable, futile even. But if the things we post are found and read by even one person, perhaps this all becomes worth the effort we invest.

Sometimes it pays to go against the flow - to be the lone voice among the thousands telling a different story. Maybe we have nothing controversial to say, but that's not necessarily such a bad thing. Truth, honesty, faith, originality, and individuality are powerful traits.

Think of what we do not as contributing to the raging torrent, but climbing onto an island - an island somebody else might discover from time to time. We are not so much lost, as waiting to be found.

We had some difficult news last night about a family member. It wasn't completely unexpected, but still - it was difficult to hear, and to accept. I had to write a horrible email to the senior staff when I got in this morning, asking them not to schedule me for any travel over the next couple of months so I could be around to support my other half as events unfold.

There is a chance that this might not be "it", and we're clinging to that hope, but it's not easy.

All I can do at the moment is "be there". I'm pretty good at getting on with things - putting one foot in front of the other, and "carrying on regardless". For me that will probably mean taking the kids to school, fetching them, making meals, washing clothes, and whatever else needs doing over the coming weeks.

It's going to be hard, but I guess this is an experience we all go through at some point in our lives. Not fun.

I'm sitting in the middle of the lounge, which was tidy yesterday until my other half started "making stuff" for our youngest daughter's birthday party. Tidy in this house is always relative - it often resembles "The Burrow" from Harry Potter - stacked with piles of miscellaneous stuff that either the children, or my other half have dumped from room to room.

It's just turned 9am. I got up at 8, after staring at the wall for a while. I had planned on clearing the garden up today, but there is a constant drizzle falling from the sky at the moment - playing a gentle pitter patter sound on the windows at the back of the house. Fingers crossed it clears up before the birthday party tomorrow.

Half an hour passes, and I've made bacon rolls for all the children, washed up, made another coffee, filled the tumble dryer and washing machine, and am now half-watching our eldest play "Crossy Road" on the Amazon Fire TV (quite possibly the best investment of the last year).

It's still raining outside. The weather forecast says it will clear up later, but I'm not holding out much hope. I would like to tidy the garden up later a little at least - hack some of the jungle back a bit - maybe even cut the grass. I guess the rain has put paid to that idea.

Best news today so far was seeing the photos of a distant friend's wedding on Facebook. We've sort-of known each other for years on the internet - it was wonderful to see her smiling in the photos.

Anyway... I need to get off my ass. Later.

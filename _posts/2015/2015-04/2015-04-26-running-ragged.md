Today didn't really happen.

After getting up ridiculously early - and miraculously without a hangover after last night's shenanigans - I washed up, tidied up the house, and generally made myself useful.

By 10am I was standing outside the local football club, waiting to attend a meeting to talk about future plans for the kids teams. The guy holding the keys was busy planting carrots in his allotment about half a mile away. After a couple of phone calls he came ambling towards the football ground with no hurry in the world.

The meeting was interesting - and kind of ironic. The issue being talked about was if they could field three teams next season instead of two. If 75% of the kids turn up, they can field 3 teams. Less than 75% of the parents showed up for the meeting. Therefore the parents we needed to know about were very probably not present. Fantastic.

After the meeting I wandered home, and found our eldest in the living room on her own - wrapped in her duvet, watching cartoons. The rest of the family had gone to Church, and were then going on to lunch at the Church Hall (run by the same couple that fed 40 people at the school event the night before - I reallydon't know how they do it).

I wandered back into town, and picked up our younger children, who had to be at a dance rehearsal across town. I'm not allowed to know anything about the dance show we will be attending next weekend - it's all "top secret". After dropping the kids, I passed a Dad I know walking in the opposite direction.

"Didn't I just see you leaving the Church Hall in town?"

"Yes"

"How did you get up here so fast then? You're walking back TOWARDS town!"

"Magic"

After dropping the kids off, I went grocery shopping, and wandered home again - giving my just enough time to throw a load in the washing machine before leaving again to meet up at the school with my other half, and to help pack the remnants of the fund-raising event into a friend's van. Who knew lugging 200 benches from one end of the school to the other would be so much fun (it wasn't).

After finally escaping the school, we finally came home - loaded with leftover food from both the lunch, and the fund-raiser. Our freezer is now full to bursting with enough cottage pie to feed a small army.

This evening has been all about washing clothes, washing dishes, and tidying up again and again. I feel like falling into bed right now, but another part of me wants to reclaim some weekend by staying up late. We shall see...

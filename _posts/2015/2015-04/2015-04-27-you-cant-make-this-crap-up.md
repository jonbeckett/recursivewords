I came home from work early today, to pack my bag ready to travel this evening. After doing so, our eldest daughter arrived home, and wondered out-loud who was picking the younger children up from school. Which caused me to wonder, because I hadn't been in on the conversations at all.

I logged off the computer, and back onto it as my other half - hoping that the browser cookies for the likes of Facebook would remember her (I don't know her Facebook password). Straight in. Sigh of relief. The first conversation in the messages was from a friend who our middle daughter was visiting for dinner. The second conversation was another friend, cancelling the play-date for our youngest.

Oh crap. Where is she then? My other half was on a training course, and wasn't answering her phone. I hit Facebook (logged in as me), and started to panic.

Within a minute I knew where our middle girl was. A few minutes later I had the phone number of the mum that cancelled, and called her. No, our youngest was not at their house.

"I talked to your other half this morning, and let her know"

Phew. That means she actually got through to her (more than I did), so something must have happened.

"Can I just check - do you mean you actually spoke to her?"

"No. I sent her a message."

The message I had already read - that my other half hadn't replied to.

After a few more calls, somebody mentioned Judo - and everything fell into place. I stopped panicking.

The Mum that cancelled the play-date made a mistake in her message cancelling it - saying it was for tonight. She meant tomorrow night. Then my other half SAW that message, and responded by text message - not via Facebook messenger... then she didn't respond to any of my emails, texts, or phone calls. This all conspired to leave me in the dark, and summoning a small army of Mums - who started calling each other, calling the school, and so on.

Nightmare.

She wasat Judo all along.

It's nearly 10am, and I just made my first coffee of the day. I could do with another one.

When I arrived at the office this morning on the mountain bike, the guy I wrote about yesterday was standing on the doorstep of the house next door. I didn't want to look, because it would have been strange (and who knows, perhaps they secretly read this?), so I glanced while climbing the stairs. She let him in. I think.

Maybe I got it all wrong. Maybe they've had a huge secret relationship. Maybe he gave her the cottage in order to have her nearby? Maybe there's nothing of the sort going on.

Perhaps the fact that I take such an interest in others means my own life sucks at the moment - far more likely, but it's just more fun to speculate about others than do anything about improving my own lot. Besides - escapism is powerful, and it's really the only reason for this blog to exist. Right now I should be writing some very boring programming, but instead I'm writing this.

I wonder what I can find to do instead of what I should be doing next ?

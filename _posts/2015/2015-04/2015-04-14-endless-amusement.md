The office where I work is nestled in the bottom of a quiet country estate - the final mile of my cycle to work each day is through leafy tree lined roads, alongside the River Thames as it meanders past on it's way to London.

There are a number of cottages behind the office - the cottages built for the workers on the estate perhaps a hundred years ago. In one of the offices a member of the family that owns the estate lives on his own (as far as I can tell), and in the adjacent cottage, a businesswoman lives on her own (again, as far as I can tell). I think I have mentioned her before - I often pass her on the way to work - she walks her dog most mornings and evenings. Over the months we've come to know each other a little - smiling, and exchanging greetings as I thunder past on the mountain bike. Did I ever mention that she's very attractive? Well she is. I'm mentioning it now, because it makes the next part of this story all the more amusing.

It hadn't gone un-noticed that the guy that lives adjacent to her was "just happening" to be outside the house doing things during the time window on a morning when she might walk her dog, go to work, or return home from work. He obviously has nothing to do (I say obviously - he might be a hugely skilled barrister, or writer, or anything really - I have no clue) - but he's always around the place, not appearing to achieve very much. And now he's not appearing to achieve very much whenever she is around. It's pretty comical. I've almost thought about moving offices purely to observe his antics.

Anyway. Today there has been a new development.

He has bought a three wheeled motorbike, and parked it outside her house. Not outside hishouse. Outside herhouse. Might we surmise this is to make sure she sees it? Who can say. I would hazard a guess that she might have been more impressed with a "proper" motorbike - but no, he has bought a three wheeler - the kind with two wheels at the front, and one at the back. Now I'm going to be completely uncharitable - I'm wondering if he can even ride a bike.

I guess in some ways I feel sorry for her. If the situation is going on that appearsto be going on, surely she must be aware of it? How on earth do you let somebody down when they have become infatuated with you (if that is indeed what's happening) ? Given that his family owns the entire estate, and he lives next door, it must all be pretty damn awkward.

I'm hoping I've got it all wrong, and this is all a huge "Billy Liar" story, concocted in the darker corners of my imagination. It's not really happening, is it? It can't be, can it? I hope not.

It's very rare that I become annoyed with anybody online, but it happened today - not because of anything they did directly - but by their behaviour, denial, and lies. Witnessing somebody telling me a fabricated load of rubbish that we both knew was just that - rubbish - annoyed me. I didn't say anything at the time, because I didn't want to have to deal with all the crap (and the irony isn't lost that I'm now writing at length about it).

It mystifies me how some people can go through life doing one thing, and saying another - when it's obvious to everyone surrounding them that there is a huge disconnect going on.

Maybe some people don't realise that others read the things they post, and have a pretty good memory. We notice the glaring disparities, and silently chalk them up on a vast spreadsheet in our head - along with everything from grammatical mistakes, spelling errors, tales of woe, rants, and who knows what else. We disregard most of it, but now and again they will come out with something that tips a balance somewhere, and our relationship with them is changed.

Thankfully the internet is an ocean filled with countless millions of fish, and the enthusiasm, honesty, creativity, hope, and industriousness shared by the many far outweighs the negativity, and lies spread by the few.

I got in from work at 6pm. Our eldest daughter was home, but the rest of the family were still presumably en-route home from the studio tour at Warner Brothers Harry Potter set (which should really be titled "the biggest rip-off on earth" - more about that later).

The kitchen was trashed. The lounge was trashed. The playroom was trashed. The study was trashed.

I started washing up immediately - it took me an hour just to clear everything that had been left all over the kitchen. After that I started walking back and forth to the dustbin - and started counting the trips. I walked to the bins nine times... Next up was the study - not so I could use it - so eldest could (she had been sitting in among the trash like Stig of the Dump when I arrived home - hadn't lifted a finger to help with any of it - just found a gap among the rubbish to sit). I began clearing up around her, and she stomped off to her room - leaving me to it.

The toilet hadn't been flushed, and there was no toilet paper. There was a board game thrown across the playroom, and lego tipped all over the floor.

Finally at 7:30 the rest of the family arrived home, and set about dumping sandwich boxes, coats, shoes, and everything else all over the house. I walked along behind them picking things up as they dropped them - none of them even noticed what I was doing, or that I was becoming increasingly pissed off with them all.

Just to cap off a craptastic night, after eating dinner, I walked back into the kitchen to discover the whole place trashed again, cooking trays thrown everywhere, and yet another sink full of washing up (three sink fulls, it turned out by the time I finished). We were supposed to get a dishwasher before Christmas, but the car went wrong - so the money went on that instead.

A part of me says "you're just in a crappy mood because you had to go to work today, and they didn't", but it's more than that. I'm fed up that everything I do is taken completely and utterly for granted. I get nothingback in return for all the things I do.

It's already 8:30pm. The TV show I might have liked to have watched is already half over. If I even attempt to watch anything later, I will be encroaching on my other half watching an endless round of CSI, NCIS, Law and Order, and who-knows-what-else garbage detective shows.

And people wonder why I write a blog.

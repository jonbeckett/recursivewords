Somebody has disconnected the virtual machine I use to work on a remote client system, meaning I'm pretty much dead in the water for the next phase of some pretty important work. I guess this is their problem, so I'm not going to get too wound up about it - but it will end up biting me in the ass in a few weeks time.

I have other stuff I can be getting on with, but it's still a bit ridiculous when things like this happen.

I think my week maybe disrupted pretty badly anyway, because my father-in-law is in hospital. I'm not going to go into why, but it's obviously going to mean leaving work early to fetch the kids and so on. More disruption. Thankfully work are understanding about that kind of thing, so it shouldn't be an issue at all.

In other news, the pretty lady that lives across the way from the office said hello this morning. It's always a lift somehow when I see her. I notice her next door neighbour was out making a spectacle of himself again too - inviting himself in when she got back from her dog walk. Who knows. Perhaps there really issomething going on.

I'm still playing with LiveJournal. If only there was a way of using it that didn't involve using it (if that makes sense). People have a habit of applying "themes" to their blogs at LiveJournal that make them pretty much unusable - to the point where I can't even find a comment button, and walk off in a huff. I know there is a mobile app for it - perhaps that's the answer.

It's only 11am. I'm starving. I need to get on with some work for an hour purely to make the time pass, otherwise I'll be ravenous by late afternoon. There are several pieces of last night's pizza wrapped up in my bag, whispering to me.

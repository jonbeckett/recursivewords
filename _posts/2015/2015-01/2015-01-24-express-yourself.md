For the past few weeks I have been taking part in the WordPress "Blogging 101" course, which I will freely admit I have used primarily to find new bloggers to read - and it has worked wonderfully. However - the 101 course leaves you to your own devices on weekends, which happens to coincide with the only time I really get to post anything consquence. There's got to be some irony in that somewhere.

Rather than waffle on about life, the universe, and everything today, I thought it might be fun to do whatever the weekly photo challenge is. This week the prompt is "Express Yourself.".

I'm posting a "selfie". Some people call them "selfies", others call them "mugshots", and everybody else probably calls them "candid portraits", or something similar. Tumblr has entire memes devoted to them (but then that kind of follows, because the level of narcissism at Tumblr borders on an epidemic).

I don't post many pictures of myself online any more. I used to - usually through Facebook - sharing "what we were doing" with family and friends. That's not to say I don't appear in lots of our private photos - we have a hard drive stuffed to the gills with them - I just don't share the majority of them.

Anyway... the theme here is "Express Yourself" - and the photo above is a pretty accurate expressionof me in my usual environment - sitting in front of the computer at work wearing jeans and a t-shirt, writing thousands of lines of programming that if successful will never be noticed.

Maybe that's the true expression of the greater part of my life- "if I do this right, nobody will notice I was here".

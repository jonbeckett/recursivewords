For the past few evenings I have been sitting the moleskine notebook in front of me on the desk in the study junk room, and trying to empty my head. It's not happening easily at the moment, but it's getting easier. I'm having to remind myself that writing in the book is different than writing for publication on the internet - there is no self censorship.

I have become perhaps overly cautious about the words I post to the internet - to the point they become boring. Of course a paper diary holds no such risks - unless I photography a page with something scandalous scrawled across it - which I have not doneyet.

There is something about a paper journal though - it appeals to the more eccentric, contraryside of my character. I am surrounded by all manner of connected devices, and yet the medium of choice when it comes to recording thoughts is still pen and paper, and probably always will be.

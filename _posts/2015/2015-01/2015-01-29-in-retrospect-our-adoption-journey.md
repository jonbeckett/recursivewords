After resurrecting thousands of archived posts back into the blog earlier this evening, it occurred to me that I can finally re-tell our adoption journey once more. Recent readers have no idea how far back this blog goes, or how much I recorded along the way. I guess I did it because I knew I would forget how we felt - our worries, our concerns, or even who we used to be. I also wanted something the children could look back on, and learn about who we were - how excited we were, and what we had to go through.

With a little luck the following record will be a treasure trove to the girls when they grow up.

You never know - a publisher might see this and invite me to turn it into a book

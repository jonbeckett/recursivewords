No, this post is not about the space ship in the short-livedTV series "Firefly" - it is a response to WordPress "Daily Post" photoprompt"Serenity.", and for the Blogging 101 exercise for the day; Publish a post based on your own, personalized take on aDaily Prompt. I've never done a photo prompt before, and being me, I'm not going to do it in a conventional manner either, because that would be far too predictable.

I'm guessing most people will post photos of prayer, beaches, or the sky. I'm posting a photograph of a mug of coffee in our kitchen, on a Sunday morning after the kitchen has been tidied up, the washing machine switched on, the kids quietly watching cartoons elsewhere in the house, and a first chance has presented itself to make a coffee, and donothing for a few minutes.

Generally the silent scene is broken within minutes by a knock at the door, or the arrival of a tree haired little girl in her pyjamas suggesting a trip to the cinema, the playpark, the fast food place in town, or wherever else has just occurred to her that will throw your lack of plans for the day into disarray.

So... my serenity is those few moments on a weekend morning when I get a chance to stop for a few minutes, sip my coffee, and stare into space.

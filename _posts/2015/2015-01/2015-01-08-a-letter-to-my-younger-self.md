Today's exercise for the WordPress Blogging 101 course is to write a post for a dream reader - real or imaginary. I have decided to write a letter to my younger self. Enjoy!

This letter has travelled 20 years into the past to find your hands. At the time you read this, you are single, you still live with your parents, you have just left college, and you are working for the family business. You better sit down - you're not going to believe what I have to tell you.

In 20 years time you are married. You met a girl in Oxford one Sunday afternoon in 2000. Neither of you thought it would go anywhere at first, but you saw each other again, and again, and nature took its coursepretty good going for somebody who was always a best friend, and had consigned himself to never meeting anybody.

You will live near London. Months from now, your entire family will scatter across England. You will find your career a couple of miles from the girl you're going to meet, and will work as a software and web developer. Code you are going to write will be used by big companies all over the world. Thousands of people will rely on the things you buildto do their job every day. You will be regarded as a good software developer by your peers, and a great web developer.

You're going to love the web.

The next one is huge. You're going to have three children. Three little girls. They will be fantastic, and will make you smile, laugh, and occasionally shout. The eldest will be just like you, the middle one will have the loudest voice in the known universe, and the youngest is going to be troubleshe will be blonde, pretty, and will know it.

You will write a journal on the internet. Compuservethat you're thinking about joining at the momentwill not last for many years. The internet will become generally available to everybody, and the "web" will be invented at CERN. They will become everybody's primary means of communicating with friends, colleagues and associates. Your mobile phone will do everything your current computer does, and much more. You will use it as a camera, to listen to music, to watch movies, to play games, to send and receive emails, and to chat with people all over the world.

Oh yes... you are going to have friends all over the world. You will become closer to some of your friends on the internet than those in the real worldyou will catch up with each other almost every day. You don't want to know how many computers you're going to have around the house.

Your life is going to change enormouslyyou are going to be happy, have a fantastic family, and lots of friends. You're going to work all over the countrysometimes overseasand you're going to love your work.

Its all good. Look forward to it all.

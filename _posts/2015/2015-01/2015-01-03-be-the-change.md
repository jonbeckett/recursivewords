In response to The Daily Post's writing prompt: "Be the Change." While exploring the "Daily Post" WordPress site this afternoon in search of some kind of "Event" to take part in - partly as an excuse to force me into writing more often - I stumbled upon the "Daily Prompt", and the title of this post - "Be the Change". The title doesn't really explain what the post is supposed to be about, but the tagline does; "what change, big or small, would you like your blog to make in the world?".

I would like my blog to reassure those that find it that it's okay not to play the same game played by the niche bloggers, the marketers, the lifestyle bloggers, and the attention seekers. It's ok to just empty your head into the keyboard when you feel like doing so.

I have been writing a blog in one shape or another for over a decade. I have never sought attention, bought followers, or marketed myself in any way (unless you can call cross-posting to Twitter marketing?). I just post whatever comes to mind - whatever ison my mind. Sometimes it's the story of the day, sometimes a thought, sometimes a memory. I find writing a blog is a huge escape - it's one of the few things I have in my life that is "all about me". Sure, I write about others from time to time, but it's my perspective - my thoughts - my opinions.

Perhaps interestingly, I don't advertisethe existence of my blog tomy real-world friends and family. I have purposely drawn a line in the sands of the internet between the public "me", and the private "me". The private version isn't really hidden - just not advertised. It gives me more of a chance to express myself without the Facebook stalking contingent "outing" me. One or two of them have found the blog from time to time, and lit up the stats like a christmas tree as they read the entire damn thing- but by and large, very few people I know in the real world have any cluethat I write this stuff.

While digging through the long forgotten catacombs of the external network drive at home this evening, I came across a rather sizeable XML file with a cryptic name. Rather than continue looking for the thing I originally set out for, curiosity got the better of me. The file contained the archives of my blog posts from 2003 through to 2012.

After a little tinkering in a text editor, I took the blog offline for a while earlier this evening, and imported everything. I guess I need to make an archive page - because there's so much there, it's almost impossible to navigate unless you know what you're looking for.

For the last half an hour I have been meaning to check that everything looks ok - but keep getting sidetracked reading the old posts. Some of them are a bit garbled, and many are missing images, but the words all seem to have survived.

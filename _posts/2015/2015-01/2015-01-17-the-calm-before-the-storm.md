We have three girls coming to visit for a sleepover tonight. Add that to the three girls already in the house, and I can't imagine us getting much sleep. It's only just occurred to me that I'll be outnumbered seven to one.

They are all at the cinema at the moment, and then off to get something to eat.While the are out,I have been into town to buy party food, and started re-arranging the house - building barricades, installing water canons, etc. I'm joking. I made the bed in the spare room, and set the DVD player up. Hopefully we'll be able to shut the door on them.

It snowed this morning - for about an hour. I havenever seen the kids get up and dressed so fast on a weekend. The shouts of "IT'S SNOWING!" from the newly crowned Miss Eleven could have powered Monsteropolis for years. I looked out mid-morning to see them running back and forth in the play-park across from our house with the sled - even though there was only just enough snow to cover the ground.

In other news, Miss Fourteen is not speaking to me again. We went from "everything is fine and dandy" to "I hate you, I hate this family, and I hate this house" in about five seconds, because she asked if she could have a pet chinchilla, and I said no. You want to know what put the idea of a chinchilla in her head? An animated GIF she saw on the internet.

Welcome to my world.

Oh - nearly forgot - I installed some old games from the GoG website on the old desktop PC. I have several cases of "Bloaty Head" to go treat in "Theme Hospital" later. Wish me luck.

After gathered in the lounge this evening on the last night of the Christmas holiday, we picked the movie "Maleficent" to watch while eating pizza, and drinking fizzy drinks.

I remember the movie arriving at the cinema last year, and reading the early reviews. The criticsseemed to be fairly unanimous in commenting that the story, and supporting cast were overshadowed every time Angelina Jolie appeared on the screen - and I would have to agree with them. Completely.

I don't think I've ever seen anybody look so strikingly beautiful in a movie before. Of course, she was covered in prosthetics and makeup, and of course she was digitally enhanced, and of course she was shot perfectly, with wonderful lighting. None of that detracts from the end product though - a fairy tale villain that becomes so hypnotic that everybody,and everything else in the movie is renderedinsignificant.

Wonderful movie.

And before you mention the beloved story of Sleeping Beauty being re-written to fit the plot of the movie, get over yourself. J M Barry wrote several versions of Peter Pan, and kept revising it for years. Tolkien knew there were massive plot holes in his books, hence the appendices. Go look at The Magician's Nephew - if it was turned into an accurate screenplay, the dialogue would be laughed out of the cinema.

Please excuse me - I have every one of Angelina Jolie's movies to go and watch obsessively research.

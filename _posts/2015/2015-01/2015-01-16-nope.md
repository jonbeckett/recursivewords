Today's exercise for the WordPress "Blogging 101" course is titled "Spruce up your Sidebar", and asks us to add a couple of widgets to the sidebar of our blog. Luckily there is a get-out secondary exercise - no doubt they saw me coming - to write a shorter-form post.

I'mnot going to fiddle with the sidebar. I've said this before, and I'll say it again (starting to sound like a scratched record) - websites filled with all manner of crap look like badly organised jumble sales. I want people to read the crap I write. Yes, it's crap, but I'm not about to ladel hundreds-and-thousands all over it, and dress it up with chocolate chips. They're just words.

So nope. Not going to fiddle. And this qualifies as a shorter-form post, probably. Unless I rant on a bit more.

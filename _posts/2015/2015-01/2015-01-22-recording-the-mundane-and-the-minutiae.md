Today's exercise for the Blogging 101 course at WordPress challenges us with the following; Build your storyteller's toolbox by publishing a post in another format or a style you've never used before. I rarely post photographs within my posts, but willmake an exception to that rule today, and throw a few photos from Instagram into a gallery for your viewing pleasure (or horror, depending on your photographic skills).

I have used Instagram for years now - although I deleted my original account (under my real name) when they were acquired by Facebook. I realised afterwards that I was being a bit of an idiot, and re-joined. I tend to take photos of anything and everything - usually while avoiding what Ishould be doing.

If you search me out at Instagram I'll follow you back.

p.s. WhatsApp have a web client, and it works really well. If you want to add me to your WhatsApp instant messenger app, you'll need my mobile number - which is now in the contact page.

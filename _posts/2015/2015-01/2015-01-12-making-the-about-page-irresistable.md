This feels like cheating. It's half past midnight, so technically Monday morning, but still Sunday night in my head. I was supposed to be heading off to bed, and was about to log out of the computer in the study junk room, when I spotted that the browser had been left open on the WordPress reader page. I hit refresh to see if there were any new comments, and the latest post from WordPress showed up - the Blogging 101 exercise for tomorrow. I guess this means I can get it out of the way early, and get back to posting insufferable dross tomorrow.

The assignment says I have tocreate and publish an "About"page, and adapt it for a widget on your home page.

Guess what sports fans - I already did that. I've been around the blogging block, and already drunk the cool-aid. My Aboutpage was the second thing I posted when I set up shop for the gazillionth time at WordPress (the first thing I publishedwas a very boring "Hello World" post, that could possibly be termed a weapon by the Geneva Convention - reading it is likely to induce narcolepsy).

I supposeAbout pagesareimportant, but I can only ever see the author of the blog being that interested in their content. In my experience, people don't read old posts, and they don't read pages - they tend to read the latest thing you have shared, and they make snap judgements on that. Sure, if you become famous, then you're going to attract stalkers who really will read anything and everything available - but outside of that world, nope. You're a nobody, and nobody is really that interested that you once had a family dog called Toby that ate frozen beefburgers, threw them up, and ate them again. Twice.

I filled much of my about page with a variety of mugshots taken over the last couple of years - firstly because my face hardly ever appears in the blog (if you're wondering what I look like, go look), and secondly, because I really didn't have much to write about. I could write something autobiographical, but I think it's probably better to save stories for blog posts, rather than some contrived synopsis of my life. I did write the one sentence version for the "tagline", which sort of complies with the exercise's demands - but only because I've seen others do it.

I'm rambling.

I lucked into already having done tomorrow's Blogging 101 exercise. I bet that's the last timethat happens.

Today's assignment for the Blogging 101 course asks us to create and upload a simple header, and/or background, and to try a custom widget. I'm not doing it, and I'm beginning to wonder about the direction the exercises are going in.

Maybe my perspective is different because I'm coming into this as an established blogger - but if I had just reset the look and feel of my bloglate last week, and am now being asked to fiddle with it again, I wouldn't be happy.

Perhaps my perspective is skewed, because I gravitate towards themes that lack decoration. I've learned the hard way that content is all that really matters on the internet. Iintentionally avoid banners, and endless piles ofwidgets that readers will take no notice of.

I'm guessing any marketers that read this will disagree completely, and present some kind of diametrically opposed argument in defence of branding, and identity. I am not a brand though - I am a human being, writing words.

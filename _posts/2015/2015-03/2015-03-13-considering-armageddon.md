I have too many fingers in too many on-line pies. It's getting ridiculous, and I'm wondering about taking the "new broom" approach to sorting everything out - essentially sweeping everything away, and starting over. Maybe reverting everything to my own domain. I'm really not sure at the moment. The best idea would probably be to sit on my hands and donothinguntil I'm really sure what I want to do.

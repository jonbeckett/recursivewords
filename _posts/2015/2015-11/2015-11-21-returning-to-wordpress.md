After something of an adventure duringthe past few months, I find myself back at WordPressfinally putting some foundations in place. Making an investment in the form of a domain nameseems analogous to signing the leasehold on a brick-and-mortar property.

Atthe moment the property is no more than a collectionof packing boxesneatly labelled 2003 through 2015, containing many thousands of the stories, thoughts, ideas, hopes and dreams I haverecorded over the past 12 years.

Over time I hope to extend the storybut much of that depends on having a story or two to share. Given my inexhaustible ability towrite something about nothing (or at least complain about anything), I don't foresee the well drying up for a good few years yet.

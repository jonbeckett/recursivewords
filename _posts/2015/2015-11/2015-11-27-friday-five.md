It's been a while since I've done a post like this. I'm actually sitting at work, trying to kill the last half an hour while waiting for a server to sort it's life out. There isn't enough time to really start anything else, so this seems as good a thing to get on with as any.

Let's see We have been invited out for dinner tonight toa friend's house. Threeother couples are goingone I know, the others I don't. I imagine the evening before we get there is going to be absolute mayhem; trying to feed the kids, and then clean up before showering, changing, and running out the door. Looking forward to it thoughI don't get out much, and the people that have invited us are wonderful. Our eldest daughter has had a horrible few weeks at schoolentirelycaused by acircle of girlsturning against her pretty spectacularly. We are gently encouraging her to move on and have nothing to do with thembut dropping all of herfriends is a huge ask. I re-installed Drupal 8 on a server in the cloud last night. I imagine this means nothing to you. I'm not going to trumpet it's existence for a while, because I need to make it presentable first. Ireally need to get out running again. It's been years since I last went running regularly. I'm slowly putting on weight, year on year, and I know running wouldreverse that immediately. Finding time to run will probably be the biggest problem. I would have to be home from a morning run by at least 7am to have half a chance of making breakfasts, lunches, washing up, and getting the kids out of the door to school.Maybe I could run on a weekend early in the morning? I don't appear to have a fifth thing to write aboutwhich makes writing a title of "Friday Five" look pretty ridiculous now. Maybe the fifth thing can be this whole blogging larkor the fact that since getting a half-decent phone with Instagram on it, I haven't taken any photos worth speaking of.

Ok. I have ten minutes to go at work. Time to start shutting stuff down I guess. Have a great weekend!

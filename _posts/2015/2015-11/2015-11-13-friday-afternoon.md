I'm having a break in-between other things to write a quick blog post. It's been quite a week. For those that haven't been reading, I've been single handed this week while my other half travelled to the north of England with her Mum. The trip had been planned for her parents earlier in the yearpaid forbut then her Dad passed away so she agreed to go instead.

It's been interesting. Working from home is do-able, but only with restricted hours. I'm dropping the youngest at school for 8:40am, back here ten minutes later, and log in to get on with work (I'm a software and web developer for a Microsoft partner).

I've actually got far more done at home than I usually get done in the office, because I haven't been interrupted. In the office there tends to be a steady stream of other developers wandering up to me to ask how to do things, or to help them with something or other. While I should be flattered, it often ends up with me getting very little done.

My afternoon comes to a halt at about 3:15 when I walk down to the junior school to pick up our youngest. She went to school dressed as Thor today, with the hammer I made last nightthey were all in costume for "Children in Need"an annual fund raiser in the UK to support children's charities. Evenings throughout the week have been filled with ferrying children to a variety of dance classes and sports clubsit's been never ending.

This lunchtime I walked into town to buy pizzas for dinner (Friday night is Pizza night!), and made it back without the house falling down, so there's that at least. The washing machine and tumblr dryer have been going pretty much non-stop all week, and for a change the kids have been pretty great. I tend to think taking one of us away removes their option to play us off against one another, so they tend to behave.

Anyway an hour until I go to get Miss 10 from school. Better get on with something.

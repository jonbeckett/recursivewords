It seems to have escaped the main-stream news because it's obviously far more important for every news organisation on the planet to cover doom and gloom stories rather than anything exciting, or hopeful.

This week Blue Originthe spacecraft engineering startup put together by Jeff Bezos (CEO of Amazon) not only escaped the atmosphere, but then landed the rocketexactly where they planned to.

There's a wonderful video on Youtube:[youtube=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pillaOxGCo&w=640&h=390]I can't get over how quickly Blue Origin have overtaken Space-X (Elon Musk's rocket engineering startup). In my mind, competition is the best thing that could possibly have happenedbecause it means commercial spaceflight is going to arrive far more quickly than anybody anticipated.

I guess this means I need to start practicing on Kerbal Space Program a bit moreyou never knowthey might put out a call for people with experience of orbital mechanics

I really need a camera on my bike helmet. Some of the things I see on the road every day beggar belief. This morning I was in a queue of cars approaching a t-junction, and a car was waiting on the opposite side of the road to turn through the queue of cars.

I stoppedput my feet on the ground, and nodded to let the guy waiting throughthe queue of cars in front of me wasn't going to go anywhere after all.

Just as he began manoeuvring, the car behind mea small silver car driven by a mid-twenties guy in a suitdecided he couldn't wait, and skidded as he swerved around menarrowly missing the car that had signalled, and had begun turning.

It would have been unbelievable if it hadn't been such a normal thing to expect so many dick-ish drivers to do. What had the silver car gained? Ten yards perhaps and the admiration of everybody in the immediate vicinity. I was sorely tempted to gesticulate various questionable signals, and mouth all manner of colourful obscenities at him as I passed him a few moments later, but of course I didn'tI silently continued on, imaging the things I should have done or said.

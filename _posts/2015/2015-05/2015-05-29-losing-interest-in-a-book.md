For my birthday this year my family bought me a new Kindle. I had forgotten all about putting it on my Amazon wish-list, so the surprise was wonderful when the parcel arrived. It is not my first Kindle. It probably won't be the last. Flying in the face of book snobs everywhere, I see no problem with buying books in digital form - all the authors want is you to read their words - they don't care how you do that.

Anyway. Getting side-tracked already.

I bought a book to read while commuting recently. It was good - not great - just good, and made several long journeys pass much more quickly than they otherwise might have done. When I reached the end of the story, the Kindle helpfully told me there was a sequel, and it was on offer.

Moments later I began reading the sequel.

I'm perhaps a third of the way into the second book, and already wondering if I'm going to carry on. The last couple of chapters have been a struggle. Not as bad as "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix", but a struggle none the less.

I hate not finishing things.

I need to find a really great book to take my mind off it. Suggestions ?

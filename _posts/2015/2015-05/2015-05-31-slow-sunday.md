It's just gone 4pm on Sunday afternoon. I'm holed up in the study with a glass of wine. I got up fairly early this morning - kicking around the house, tidying up, washing up, throwing clothes in the washing machine and dryer, and basically "getting on with stuff" until the kids arrived downstairs. After making breakfasts and washing up again, we sat and watched TV together for a while.

Just lately I've caught myself heading off to do whatever, and spent time with the kids, doing whatever they have been doing on purpose. They had started to think of me "always working", which wasn't great. At home when they saw I was in the study doing something or other with the computer, they would always presume I was working - not that I was just tinkering with the Raspberry Pi, or something similar.

So. This morning we sat together, and watched an episode of Robin Hood - the BBC TV show from a few years ago. They have been watching episodes back-to-back throughout the weekend, and breathlessly informed me who was who as the story unfolded. After watching for a little while I started to wonder where my other half was, so wandered upstairs.

Fast asleep. That's where she was. I wiggled her foot through the duvet.

"Good morning"

"Urmmffff"

"Do you know what time it is?"

"Urrmmfff"

"Almost 11am."

She woke up with a start, and squinted at me.

"Really ?"

"Yes."

I said nothing more - just smiled, picked up a couple of glasses from her side of the bed, and wandered back off downstairs.

The rest of the day has been similarly quiet. I made everybody lunch, and then wandered into town to buy food for packed lunches for the school week ahead - taking Miss 10 and Miss 11 with me, on the promise of buying them a hot chocolate. In reality I just wanted to get them off their backsides for an hour - they had been watching TV all day.

Town was remarkably quiet today - we didn't pass a single person walking the mile-or-so towards the shops - there was no queue in the cafe either.

Ah crap... I can't be bothered writing this stuff. You probably can't be bothered reading it either. I don't know why I bother half the time. I was going to write a post earlier about the whole "blogging" thing, but didn't - I couldn't be bothered.

I can't be bothered to do a lot of things at the moment. Must be the time of year.

I discovered today that I will be in London all week. All I have seen so far is an email notification from a project plan update. I'm not really expecting any more; it will be down to me to find out what I'm doing, where I'm going, who I'm meeting there, and whatever else. It's all a bit chaotic at the moment.

Today was a good day. The penultimate day at one client site, and the day before it could all quite possibly go wrong. I'm not going to get into why in a public forum because it wouldn't be professional, or fair. Let's just say I'm trying to block tomorrow from my mind.

In other news, I nearly fell asleep reading my book on the way home.

I'm wracking my brains to think if anything of interest happened today. The only thing that comes time mind at all was the businessman on the London Underground that insisted on trying to read his newspaper when there was no room to even open it. Idiot.

My three day stint as a teacher is over for this week. That doesn't mean the early starts have quite finished though - I'll be returning to London once more in the morning for a conference - sitting in the audience this time, instead of standing in front pretending to be clever.

Today was unremarkable in the extreme. Got up, woke the kids up, shower, dressed, made packed lunches, threw stuff in my bag, and walked out the door. Managed to buy a train ticket as soon as I got on the train (phew!), and read my book all the way into London.

A girl sat next to me on the train and did the same thing that all pretty girls do - invaded my personal space with no qualms what-so-ever. If it had been a cold day, the shared body heat might have been nice, but as it was, her body wedged against mine meant I couldn't hold the Kindle easily at all.

Costa Coffee at Kings Cross was unremarkable. I tried to take a photo of the staff going about their work, but people kept getting in the way so I gave up. I love candid street photography, and have found myself noticing all sorts of random moments where something triggers in my head, saying "you should get a photo of this".

While reading emails on the way home, somebody remarked that I should have gone to Starbucks. Sorry. Not a coffee snob. I only get to visit coffee shops while away with work (there's no way I will pay their exorbitant prices in my home town unless I'm meeting friends - I either drink instant at home, or use the Aeropress). I know a cousin runs a coffee shop and would be appalled that I visited either Starbucks or Costa, given their mercenary high-street record.

Anyway.

I have to get up even earlier than I have been tomorrow. Catch the early train. Probably fall asleep and dribble on myself. It's going to be fun though. I get to watch other people stress out for a change.

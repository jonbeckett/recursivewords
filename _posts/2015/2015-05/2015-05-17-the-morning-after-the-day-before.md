It's just past 11am at the time of writing. I've been up since 8:30am - the kids got up about an hour later - after I had already had a shower, washed up, tidied up, hang some washing out, filled the washing machine, and got on with various other chores.

I'm tired. We got home from the music festival late yesterday (well... late for the kids). I ended up writing up a blog post in the early hours, and then crashing into bed.

Today is all about doing as little as possible - which I say while trying to stifle laughter. I started writing this an hour ago, and since then I've hung more washing on the line, put more in the washing machine, folded up washing from the line, put the spare bed away in the playroom, tidied up the playroom, put the shoes and backs back away in the hallway, hung coats back up in the hallway, and thrown out the recycling. Oh - I also washed up all the breakfast things from the kids (other half appeared, and made them pancakes - so I had a sink-full, and then some - joy).

It never stops.

I'm hoping to just sit and watch something on TV this afternoon. The rest of the family are off to visit the in-laws - all except Miss 14, who is still not talking to anybody following her implosion at the music festival yesterday afternoon.

Perhaps I'll actually get a chance to catch up on other people's blogs for the first time in several days.

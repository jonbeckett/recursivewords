I'm wondering if I can be bothered to set the alarm for 4am GMT to listen to the boxing match between Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather. I will almost certainly wake my other half up. Maybe I should sleep on the couch? Not much fun though - and pretty damn cold at this time of the year (and yes, I have heard of blankets).

I'm secretly hoping that Pacquiao beats the living crap out of Mayweather - based solely on who appears to be the nicer person. Even if you discount the fact that Mayweather is a multiple-times convicted wife beater, Pacquiao just seems to be the much nicer person - affable, smiling, relaxed, genial - unlike Mayweather who appears to be objectionable, arrogant, and aloof.

If I stay up, my body will burn itself out half-way through tomorrow. I know, because I've done it before. I at least need SOME sleep, and yet here I am at just gone midnight, writing this rubbish instead of heading to bed - because I'm stupid like that.

Well this is interesting. I'm writing this post on the Macbook - it's the first time I had had it out for months. It's been sitting on the floor of the junkroom in a backpack - wrapped in a neoprene sleeve that I bought for my original Macbook. Back in 2007 I had a white Macbook - I was doing freelance work at the time, and was making enough money to buy one. I'll probably never be able to afford a Mac ever again.

You might wonder why I don't use the Macbook more often - easy - the battery is 7 years old. It lasts a few minutes while unplugged, and I can't warrant spending more than the entire machine is worth to get a replacement from Apple.

Alongside the Macbook on the table I have my "go to" computer - the Google Chromebook, and my old netbook, that is busy installing Elementary OS. You've probably never heard of it - I'll take some screenshots when it's done and post them to Tumblr. It's an Ubuntu derivative that concentrates on being light and fast (a bit like Google Chrome, I guess). The good news is that it flies on old hardware. I tend to take the netbook with me on work trips to watch ripped movies from the external hard drive.

This wasn't supposed to be a nerdy blog post, but given that I've been head-down on development work for the last couple of weeks, I really have very little interesting news, thoughts, or ideas to share. I haven't stopped at lunchtime at all over the last couple of weeks.

Next week I'm in London for several days - hopefully the commute will give rise to all manner of entertaining stories about the (hopefully) weird and wonderful people that I cross paths with.

I've written about the morning routine when working in London so many times in the past, I can't imagine it is interesting to anybody any more. I'll give it a shot though - you never know - I might recall something of interest while writing.

I woke at 5:30am, disabled the alarm on the Kindle Fire, and then stared at the ceiling for the next half hour. As 6am arrived a friend on the other side of the world arrived in my phone, and distracted me for the next ten minutes, until I absolutely had to get up. Half an hour later I was out of the shower, teeth brushed, shaved, dressed, and had fed the cats.

Ten minutes left until I had to leave for the train station. Just enough time for a cup of rubbish instant espresso (actually, they're not bad, and they are cheap, so I'm not going to complain too much).

The train journey afforded me time to catch up on reading - continuing with a ridiculous book I started some time ago - "Off to be the Wizard". It's about a hacker that discovers the world as we know it is actually a computer program - and that it can be manipulated. I'm not going to say any more, because it will ruin the rest of the story for you. Go look it up on Amazon.

What can I say about "being a teacher" ? Because that's what I'm doing this week - being a teacher of clever stuff to business people. No, I'm not going to name the technologies involved, because that would connect too many dots and I would lose this place as any sort of escape. It turns out being a teacher is pretty easy. Being a GOOD teacher on the other hand, is incredibly difficult. Of course it helps if people tell the truth about their skill level or experience, but we're not going to go there.

Oh, the things that I could write, but am not going to.

The journey home was wonderfully predictable - I only say that because I've had disrupted journeys far more often than I would choose to. I read my book, watched the world go by, and thought about very little for the first time in recent memory.

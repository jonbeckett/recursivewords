I downloaded the "directors cut" of Nymphomaniac this morning - the controversial Lars von Trier movie - to see what all the fuss was about. I'm kind of a fan of controversial, banned, and/or notorious movies and books.

In my humble opinion - which counts for nothing - the one person in the movie that doesn't get his kit off - Stellan Skarsgard - towers over everybody else. He rarely says anything - he doesn't need to.

The explicit parts of the movie are pretty much unwarranted. Do we really need to see Jamie Bell fist Charlotte Gainsborough ? Nope. Do we know that all closeups are porn actors? Yep.

The entire thing is a contrived, boring mess. The movie snob brigade will pour scorn on my thoughts, and wax lyrical about the subtext, the lighting, the hidden messages, and the "high art" that apparently flew over my head. It didn't. The movie looks gorgeous - it's just disjointed, deliberately provocative, and ultimately boring as hell.

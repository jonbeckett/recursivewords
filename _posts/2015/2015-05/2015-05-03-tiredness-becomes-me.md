I woke a little after 5am, groped around at the foot of the bed for the headphones I had attached to the Kindle Fire last night, and blinked my eyes into focus while attempting to enter the BBC website address into the browser. For the next twenty minutes I listened to the free BBC live commentary of the boxing match between Pacquaio and Mayweather, and a number of things went through my mind.

Since when did boxing become so commercial? Although I only saw stills taken from ringside, it appeared their shorts were plastered sponsor logos, the ring was plastered in sponsor logos, the padding of the ring was plastered in sponsor logos, and in TV capture images, sponsor logos were super-imposed over the feed too. It seemed less a boxing match, more an advertorial.

I couldn't believe the booing. Well... actually, I could - because I was hearing it. I could understand why of course - Mayweather has been convicted multiple times of assaulting women, and has served prison time for it. The fact that sponsors will still go anywhere near him is kind of damning in terms of the culture and society that has allowed him to continue to be "famous" really. The negative feeling during his interview in the ring at the end of the fight was pretty damn powerful.

Finally, Pacquaio should have kept his mouth shut about injuries. Nobody likes a sore loser. Nobody likes excuses. He got paid millions of dollars by the various sponsors to try and hit the other guy. Suck it up mister.

Anyway. Holy crap am I tired Batman.

It's heading towards 11am as I write this - I woke a little before 9, made breakfast, washed up, put washing in the machine, had a shower, brushed my teeth, and got dressed. I've done nothing else yet today. It was raining cats and dogs earlier - the rain has stopped now, but it looks cold and horrible outside.

Coffee... maybe another coffee will wake me up a bit more. If we had any. Dammit.

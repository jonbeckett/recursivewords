After fitful sleep last night I finally woke with the radio alarm clock at 7, and blearily checked my phone. Looking for emails, or messages as soon as I wake has become a habit - before getting out of bed - before having a wash. Check the phone - then contemplate the horror of the coming day.

Going back to work after a bank holiday is always rubbish, isn't it. You kind of get into the rhythm of "not having to get up for work", so then getting back into the routine of dragging yourself out of bed, having a shower, making breakfasts, and making lunches to a time limit become a huge slog.

I spent most of yesterday afternoon hacking our back garden back a bit. I still need to buy a chainsaw to deal with the trees, but it's already looking a lot better than it did even a few days ago. It's probably worth describing the garden a little - it's over 100 ft long, and we are the corner plot, so it gets wider and wider - starting at the width of the house, and eventually being about 70ft wide. There are numerous trees dotted through it, none of which have been trimmed for the past 10 years - hence needing a chainsaw. It's kind of like "The Secret Garden", in that you can wander down it, and completely lose sight of the house.

Last night I kept feeling bugs climbing under my shirt, or on my legs. I'm never quite sure after working outside if they really are bugs, or just bits of plant causing itches.

Ooh - just thought of something.

While on the way to work today, I saw a woman dressed in what can only be described as a 1940s gas station pump attendant uniform leading a Great Dane into the back of a grooming parlour van. What the hell ?

I just finished washing up after dinner - it feels like the day has been an endless sprint from start to finish, and the race hasn't finished yet. I'm growing increasingly tired. Maybe the Scotland trip will recharge my batteries.

In-between grocery shopping, making lunches, ironing, packing clothes for the Scotland trip, making dinner, and washing up, it feels like Saturday hasn't really happened. I thought about sitting down for a bit earlier, but my other half stormed past and I valued continued life more than the sit down. Sitting writing this feels like a risk - I can hear her crashing around elsewhere in the house.

There's this unspoken rule in our house - if my other half is busy doing housework, you better damn well be busy doing something that's of direct assistance in some way, otherwise the ground might spontaneously burst into flames beneath you.

It hasn't helped that our eldest daughter is still waging a war of silence against all of us. She turns up at the table for meals, and stomps back to her room immediately after finishing eating. We are letting her get on with it -not reacting at all.

With a little luckthe evening ahead will afford me the chance to catch up with distant friends - to visit Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, and WordPress - to read about their latestadventures. Before that can happen however, I am being summoned to play a board game.

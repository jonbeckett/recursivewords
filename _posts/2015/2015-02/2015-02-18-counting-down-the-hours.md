It's lunchtime on Wednesday morning. Just a few hours until the end of the working day, then I have a couple of days off work before the journey to Scotland on Monday. The hotel is booked, and the train tickets purchased. The only part of the journey I'm not sure about is when I reach Edinburgh. I'm thinking about saving the cost of a taxi, and getting the local bus to the final destination.

I'll be on-the-road all day - from 10 in the morning, until perhaps 8pm at night. Trains into London, across the Underground, from London to Edinburgh, and then a bus from Edinburgh to Selkirk. The money saved using the bus instead of a taxi will be significant.

This weekend I will need to buy clothes. I tend to keep using the same clothes for months on end, until they are worn out - my clothesare worn out. A pack of shirts, and a couple of pairs of trousers to wear to the office will be a good idea. I have jeans for evenings. I have t-shirts. A couple of half-decent sweaters that are not falling apart might be a good idea. Socks. Lots of socks. And a new backpack.

I will probably take walking boots with me, and some outdoor kit. I'll be at a loose end during the middle weekend of the visit, so will head into the hills, and explore a little. Looking at Google Maps, there are a few pubs within walking distance across the fields - I guess some good maps might be an idea before setting out.

Who knows - at least the blog will be filled with storiesfor a change, rather than the contents of my head while staring at the monitor, wishing away the remains of the day.

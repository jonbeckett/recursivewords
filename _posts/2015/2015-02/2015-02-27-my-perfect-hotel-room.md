While staying in a hotel this week with work, I've started to realise the things that really count in a hotel roomfor me. I was going to title this post "The Perfect Hotel Room", but then started to realise that most of these thoughts are very individual. Anyway - here's the list of things I would like to see.

Plug sockets next to the bed. You would be amazed how few hotels do this - and yet we all carry around smart phones that need to be charged overnight. We also like to use those phones as an alarm clock that we can reach over to in the morning. A deskwithout drawers under the desk top. I'm going to have a laptop with me, and will preferrably sit at a desk to use it, rather that sit on the bed, propped up with all the pillows. If you have drawers under the desk, that means the desk top is elevated, and your arms go dead while typing. Thanks. A chair at the desk with back support. You would be surprised how many times you find a lounge chair at the desk, that you can't actually sit in, at the desk. A shower that has predictable temperature controls. This sounds like a no-brainer, but yeah... you would be amazed to discover how few of them ever seem to work reliably. I get it - the plumbing system is supplying every room in the hotel - so why not use a heater on the pipe ? Drawers for clothes. This is a rare one, so a little unfair. During my current stay away I am in the hotel long enough that having drawers would have been really great to put my clothes in, rather than having them stacked around the place. Usually I am only away for a couple of nights, so will happily live out of the suitcase - but really, having some drawers or shelvessomewherewould be good. A Television with unrestricted USB ports. I am lucky during my current stay to have this - usually the hotel has a central pay-per-view system, and the televisions are in "Hotel Mode", which locks out all the USB ports. I carry an external hard drive with me on work trips full of movies and TV shows - the work laptop is my fallback TV.

Like I said - a lot of these things are "nice to haves" - none of them are essential - but together, they would make a hotel room absolutely fantastic... for me.

I'm having a dilemma. This afternoon I will be travelling north for a few days - staying in the Holiday Inn near a client site for two nights. I'm wondering if I can fit everything in my work backpack, rather than carry a second bag. The packing list is going to look something like this;

Laptop, and Charger To get work done. Phone, and Charger To call home,to take pointless photos of railway platforms, and to chat with friends (when I have a signal). Tablet, and Charger Primarily for books and movies - it's a long journey. 2 clean shirts, socks, and underwear You know... because clothes are a good idea. Washbag Toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, hairbrush, etc.

I'm guessing if I wear the shoes and trousers I want to wear while on-site, I should be fine. I might even be able to fit the trousers in the backpack.

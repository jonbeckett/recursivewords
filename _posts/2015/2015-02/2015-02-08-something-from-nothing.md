Another late night last night. Finally the thousands of lines of source code are beginning to conjure a website out of thin air. A website where parents can register their children to take part in a summer camp, and those running the camp can plan out who does what, where, and when throughout the week.

Building websites is strange. You create something where there was nothing - based entirely on ideas, and experience. It's kind of like having an Aladdin's lamp, only you have to rub it fifty thousand times, and in just the right way for it to grant your wishes.

Last night'scoding marathonwas a hurculean effort to lurch the site towards "barely operational". There are many more nights to come - inching it closer tosomething you might vaguely describe as "operational". At the moment you might say the code is at the "sharp piece of flint" stage.

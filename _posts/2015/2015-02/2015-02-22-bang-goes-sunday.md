I had booked two days off work to spend time with the children ahead of the weekend, and then the trip to Scotland with work. We are into Sunday - the fourth and final day - and so far I have spent no time with the children at all. I have sat in the house, babysitting our eldest daughter, who has thrown tantrum, after tantrum, after tantrum about the most insignificant issues you can possibly imagine.

This morning "getting dressed" caused a meltdown. We were supposed to be headed to my other half's parents for lunch. Everything was going well - I got up early, made breakfasts, and Miss 14 made an unexpected appearance. I made her a cup of tea, and we watched TV for a few minutes. Finally it came time to get ready to go, so I asked her to go and get dressed (the younger children had already headed upstairs to find clothes). She didn't respond.

Half an hour later, she was still sitting on the sofa, in her pyjamas, completely unresponsive.

She pulled the same trick on Friday. We were all supposed to go to the zoo together, and have a fun day out. Didn't happen for me. I was stuck here, babysitting her because she didn't/wouldn't get out of bed.

Four days completely wasted, and tomorrow I head off for two weeks. I'm not entirely sure how my other half is going to cope with her - neither is she.

We watched the movie "Tomorrowland" late last night - or rather, we watched the second half of it - such is the chaos in our lives at the moment, the concept of watching an entire movie in one sitting is becoming increasingly difficult to organise or comprehend.

It wasn't the movie I was expecting, and I'm not sure how I feel about that. For the first half of the movie, it's all about an obviously brilliant girl rebelling against anything and everything - but then George Clooney arrives, and whoever made it must have decided the movie wasn't big enough for the both of them - so after spending an hour or so building a story around "She's going to make a difference - she's going to do something amazing", her moment to shine gets reduced to having a Eureka moment in front of George Clooney for a few seconds.

George may as well have turned towards the camera as soon as he appeared on the screen mid-movie, and said to the audience "It's all about me".

It wasn't all bad though - the story was inventive and interesting (although full of holes), and Hugh Laurie perhaps stole the show with his last words.

So yeah... kind of disappointed. I wanted it to be more.

If this works, I will high five myself to celebrate my own stupidity. I have wired WordPress, Tumblr, Blogger, Instagram, Flickr, and Twitter together with "If This Then That", such that whenever I post anything to WordPress, it gets cross-posted all over the place instamagically for me.

It's a shame IFTTT doesn't support Ello, or LiveJournal - then I could have turned my little corner of the interweb into Homer Simpson's nucular power station console, with a button that instantly splurges my thoughts into the nearby universe with little or no interaction from me.

You might wonder why I'm even bothering. Don't worry - I don't know why either. It's something to do, I guess. Most people have a hobby - golf, football, motor racing, or something - I tinker with pointless crap.

The WordPress blog essentially becomes "VGER" from Star Trek the Motion Picture - at the heart of an emormous, complex miracle of engineering.

It just occurred to me that if I do NaNoWriMo (National Novel Writing Month) by writing 1600 words a day through November, that also qualifies me for NaBloPoMo (National Blog Posting Month) - so I can kind of cross the streams, and claim I have achieved NaNoWriBloPoMo 

I will also have bored everybody to death, but that's besides the point.

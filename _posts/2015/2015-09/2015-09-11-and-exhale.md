I have nothing of consequence to share with the internet this fine Friday evening, but I'm not going to let that stop me writingsomethingat least. Once upon a time I would have been able to fill a page at the drop of a hat, but these days life seems to run me over given half a chance.

I'm off shopping in the morning to buy art supplies for our eldest daughter. Perhaps the journey will cross my path with a character or two, and provide inspiration for a few words.

I'm not sure if I sleep-walked through today, but I'm finding it incredibly difficult to recall anything interesting happening at all. Perhaps if something interesting happened every day, then nothing would be interesting, because everything would be normal.

Don't listen to me. I'm tired.

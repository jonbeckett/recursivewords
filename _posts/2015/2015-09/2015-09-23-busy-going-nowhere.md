After an epic five hour journey home last night, where two trains ran late, connections were missed, and the penultimate train broke down, I walked in the door and collapsed on the sofa while the children showed me what they had been doing at school.

I'm not going to work today. I haven't felt this bad in quite some time. Both of the days on-site at the other end of the country were spent coughing my lungs up, and taking the maximum dosage of cold and flu medication. I feel like my head is swimming all the time. There was a moment on Monday afternoon when I couldn't get my breath in-between coughing and sneezing, and started to wonder if there was any point to anything any more.

So. I'm sitting in the warm at home, the washing machine is churning away elsewhere in the house, and I'm just trying to sit still. If I sit still, I don't cough too much. It's ridiculous.

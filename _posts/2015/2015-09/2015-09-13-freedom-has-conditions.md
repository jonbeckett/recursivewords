The main problem that manifests on any social platform that gains traction is people. Pure and simple.

It's very easy to think of ourselves as normal - the social internet however continually reminds us that everybody's normal is different. Given the freedom of the abstraction the internet provides, our beliefs, values, behaviour, and actions can be our own - not dictated or governed by family, friends, or peers.

People seek different things on social platforms - attention, reaction, controversy, friendship, agreement, disagreement... the list goes on. The key is that we are all free to use the platforms as we wish, and free to consume the content we wish.

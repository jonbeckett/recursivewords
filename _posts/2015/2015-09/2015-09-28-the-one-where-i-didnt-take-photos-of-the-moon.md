After the mayhem abated last night, I got into bed and fell asleep - waking this morning at 7am when the radio alarm clock erupted into the local radio breakfast show. The first thing they talked about was the photos of the moon everybody was posting on Facebook.

I forgot all about it.

At lunchtime I finally got a chance to look at Facebook, and saw the photos. You know the first thing that went through my mind? I have a telescope - I could have nailed it. The sky was perfectly clear last night - it's never perfectly clear.

The photo above was taken a couple of years ago, by pointing my phone through the telescope eyepiece. I can only imagine what it would have done with the silhouetted moon.

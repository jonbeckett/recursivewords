You know the well worn phrase "stop the world, I want to get off" ? I'm starting to wonder if there's an alternate phrase more along the lines of "don't wait for me, I don't want to get on in the first place".

Tomorrow (Friday) is our eldest daughter's birthday, so we are going out in the evening as soon as I return from work for dinner together. I will literally run in the door, jump in the shower, get dressed, and go straight back out again. I don't expect we will return home until late.

On Saturday the town carnival happens in the day - and of course our children are involved - and then we are invited to a 40th Birthday in the evening, that will continue into the early hours of Sunday morning.

On Sunday we have promised to take our eldest daughter to London for the day - a part of her birthday present. There's one catch to this - I travel to the other end of the country again on Sunday evening - from London - so I have to somehow find time between now and Sunday to wash and press enough clothes that will fit in a back-pack so I can take them with me to London on the day out, then catch my train away at the end of the day, leaving the rest of my family to make their way home on their own.

I'm then at the other end of the country until Wednesday, living in a hotel room, after which I will return home late on Wednesday night.

See what I mean? I don't so much want the world to stop, as avoid getting on it at all. This is all getting a bit stupid. It didn't help that my other half woke up with a bad back, so guess who did breakfast, lunch, the school run, went to work, picked kids up from dance class, bought groceries, cooked dinner, and washed up today single-handed?

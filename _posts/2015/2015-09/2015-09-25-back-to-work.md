I'm back in the office today, and trying to keep out of mischief. My task list had two things on it - both of which were complete before lunchtime. Now I'm trying to avoid writing any code because my head is just notin the right place today.

Perhaps it's time to hit the blogging trail - go on a reading, commenting, following, and liking expedition across WordPress, Tumblr, LiveJournal, Blogger, and Ello. If you see a sudden raft of interaction from me, you'll know why.

Perhaps first it might be a good idea to go and put the kettle on.

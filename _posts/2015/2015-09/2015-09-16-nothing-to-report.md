Life has been surprisingly quiet this week, while also remaining unendlingly busy, mundane, tiring, and aggravating. There has been no one big thing that has ground me down - just an avalanche of little things - small enough that you don't notice at the time, but then wonder where the hell the day went.

I guess the main news of note this week is that I've finished the whole "Operation Recursive Codex" thing by opening a Twitter account with the same name, and a Yahoo Mail account with the same name - switching Twitter, Tumblr, WordPress, LiveJournal, Instagram, Pinterest, and Ello to use the new email address in the process. You might wonder why - because it stops people searching for my "real" email address, and finding me by chance on the social internet.

Something else happened this week too (which kind of explains the sudden move to divide myself in two). The guy in charge of the company website where I work put out a request for content authors - for articles that will be posted on the corporate site. They are looking for "thought leaders" in a number of subject areas - the worry is that I qualify for just about every subject area in the business. I'm only doing it if I can add attribution to the posts, so have gone and bought a SquareSpace account (again), and attached it to my personal domain name (again) with a selection of the more sensible posts I have written over the years.

Who knows... if my writing ends up in front of enough noses, maybe it will eventually open doors to a life where I no longer have to write code (or at least not for a living). Don't get me wrong - I love programming, but after 20+ years, I'm more interested in the bigger picture - not in the arcane details.

Last thing for this "nothing happened, nothing to see, nobody saw anything" post - the cover finally arrived for the Kindle Fire that I ordered late last week. It's a straight copy of the folding iPad stands, and works wonderfully. Finally I will be able to prop the kindle up on a train, and write with the Bluetooth keyboard.

Now if you'll excuse me, I have a headache that's itching to take over my entire head. Where's the nurofen ?

While standing between the lounge and the kitchen drying up a mug, having a conversation with my other halflast night, I twisted to say something, and something popped in the muscles in the middle of my back. I did that thing you do, where you freeze in place, and carefully re-arrange your bodywondering what just happened.I appeared to be fine. I went to bed at a half-sensible time for a change, and fell asleep almost immediately.

We won't dwell on the dream I had, because it made little or no sense whatsoever. A part of the story involved an aerobatic plane crashing into a field that happened to exist on top of a cruise liner I was onand then I met the pilot (who should obviously have been killed by the manner he bought the farm), and had a conversation with him. He was small, Italian, in his 50s, and seemed excited about using the story of surviving the crash to chat up women. I told you my dreams make no sense.

I woke up at 6am, with burning pain across my back that wouldn't go away no matter how I lay. After staring at the wall, or the ceiling for the next hour, the alarm clock went off and I somehow raised myself out of bed, pulled on clothes, and stumbled into the kids bedrooms."Time to get up!"After ripping the curtains open there were muffled noises from the duvets.

Downstairs I discovered I could actually walk around, but breathing, sitting, bending over, or reaching for things all hurta lot. Some tiny muscle or somethingdeep in my backhad ripped or torn, or whatever they do when they go wrong.

I wrote an email to work, informing them I would not be in, and started pottering around, trying to do things unsuccessfully around the house. Hanging the washing out took twenty minutes when it should have taken two. Putting washing up away from last night took ten minutes instead of one. You get the idea.

So now I find myself sittingin some discomfortin the junk room, writing this as fast as I can, because sitting here is causing my back to stiffen up again. We have kids coming for sleepovers tonight too. Not quite sure how I'm going to deal with that.

I just sat through the last 25 minutes of the Apple Worldwide Developer Conference keynote, where a number of people who used to be influential music label fat-cats were wheeled out on stage to bore the audience to tears showing off a music app that does nothing different than any other.

Ten minutes were spent selling internet radio. One channel of 24/7 radio that will apparently showcase great music. One questionwho's idea of great music? Yours? Mine? That guy that was dancing strangely at that party?I can't quite believe their arrogance.

I'm going to write something controversial, but I think it's more or less rightand it's worth noting that this is just my opinion. I think the leadership, and important roles at Apple are filled with people who are too old. Not only have they lost touch with the audience they are hoping to attract to their productsthey have also lost touch with way people consume media, and the features their competitors already provide. Apple Music does nothing new or differentit has nothing to differentiate itselfso why would anybody use it beyond laziness ?Perhaps Apple would do better to concentrate on hardware and operating systems. Allowing third party applications on a platform opens Pandora's Box reallythey will never be able to complete with the quality, diversity, invention, and originality of third party applications, because those applications are built by teams driven to make the best single application they can, rather than a so-so competitor for every damn application out there.

I'll get off my soap-box now.

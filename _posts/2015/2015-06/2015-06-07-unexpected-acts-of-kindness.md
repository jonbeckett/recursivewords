I lifted my online world in the air yesterday afternoon and discarded huge chunks of it. I said goodbye to accounts at Blogger, WordPress, and LiveJournal. I felt good about what I was doingalthough I knew a few people would be rolling their eyes. Then late last night I happened to check my email, and saw the following;(the following is an anonymous gift) 12 months of paid account time have been added to your LiveJournal accountOh. My. Word.

What the hell am I supposed to do now? I had sworn off cross-posting to anywhere, in order that all of my words exist in one place on the internetand somebody has worked outexactlyhow my brain works, and figured out how to hack it. Pretty much any random act of kindness in my direction is going to modify my plans. I shouldn't have told you that, should I.

After sleeping on it, I figured that having a LiveJournal account might not be such a bad idea really. It works very well as a "back channel", because you can secure individual postsso only your friends see themsomething none of the other major blog platforms allow.

It's a slippery slope though, isn't it. If I have one "extra" account elsewhere, I'll end up with extra accounts everywhere eventually. Not good. I'll have to try and be "strong" (yeah, rightthis is where I confidently predict some new social thing will arrive this afternoon, and I'll confidently proclaim that it's the BEST THING EVAR!).

Stop hacking me, people! Let me sit here and write my rubbish. Stop grinning. It's not funny.

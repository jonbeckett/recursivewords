An hour after writing a post listing the various stuff that usually resides in my bag last night, my other half's laptop finally decided to reach the technology tipping point that invariably ends up at the bottom of the rubbish bin.

In it's day it was the cheapest laptop Dell sold in their online store (which says a lot about the computers we own at home, to be honest). Over the years it has been re-installed several times, and the battery has become something of a jokeadding to that, several of the keys had recently started to stick, and a few had lost their covers entirelymaking typing a challenge at the best of times.

I took one look at her struggling to type something, and did what I usually dogave her the best thing I have to replace the thing she has. Ergomy other half got the Google Chromebook. Not before I installed the Google Drive app on her old laptop, and left it running overnight, uploading everything to the cloud for her.

This morning I wandered into the lounge, and the old laptop was nowhere to be seenin it's place, the Chromebook was propped on top of a half-finished knitting project, logged into Google Maps.

I guess that means I re-inherit the old Apple Macbook if I want to use anything better than the ASUS Netbook. It's a Unibody 2008 Macbook, running Snow Leopard. It had "Lion" on it for a while, but was so dog slow we ended up re-formatting it, and re-installing Snow Leopard. If you're wondering why nobody uses it any more, it needed a new battery about three years agoif the charger becomes disconnected, it lastssecondsbefore dying.

You never knowusing the Macbook could actually see the quality of my writing improveit has Scrivener installed (if you've never heard of it, go search for it onlinekind of the best word processor for writers ever, bar none). Using Scrivener would imply planning what I write though that's not going to happen any time soon.

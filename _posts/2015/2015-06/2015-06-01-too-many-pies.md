I know I go back over this again, and again. I'm wondering about choosing one place to blog again. Don't take any notice of this post - it's just me "thinking out loud".

Tumblr is great because of it's community. The web interface is straightforward, and the mobile app works well enough. Sure, there are things that don't work, and things that are missing, but on the whole it's pretty good. LiveJournal is great because almost everybody there is telling their story, rather than reblogging. It also has privacy controls, and proper commenting. Unfortunately the interface is disjointed, and something of a labyrinth. Also, unless you pay, you cannot avoid people "tinkering" with the interface to force their questionable design choices upon you. It's like MySpace from 2002 all over again. Blogger is great because it concentrates on doing one thing, and does it well - letting you write. Unfortunately it does everything else badly - photos, etc. It's kind of the forgotten foster child of the Google family. WordPress used to be great, until Automattic started trying to turn it into Tumblr. Now it's just a confused mess, full of marketing morons.

Aaarrggghhh I don't know what to do.

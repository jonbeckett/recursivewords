I just got back from the school, after dropping Miss 11 off. She is headed to France today on a school trip - travelling on the channel tunnel on the way, and coming home via ferry tonight. I have been up since 4:45am. Not hugely impressed. I guess the up-side to all of this is having an hour to myself. There is a huge temptation to go back to bed for an hour. While walking to school the absence of any traffic meant we could listen to the blackbirds singing, and wander across roads that are usually filled with impatient lines of cars, trucks, and buses.

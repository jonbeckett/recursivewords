Wow, the title of this post has lots of double letters in it. It sounded better in my head than it does written down. Anyway. Some time ago I wrote a post called "Unblogging", railing against the commercialisation of bloggingabout the packaging and marketing of blogs -personalblogs in particular.

One passage in particular stands out;People want to know each other. The words and pictures are really just a conduit. The more finely crafted they are, the more you know they are bullshit. Finely crafted bullshit, but bullshit none the less.

The more I read articles on platforms such as Medium, the more accurate the above sentiment seems to become. If an article is decorated with diagrams, photos, flowcharts, or inspirational quotes, it seems to counter any sense of honesty or truth. It is manufactureda confection, rather than an honest thought, idea, or story.

In a roundabout way, I guess all I'm saying is that I'm going to tryreallyhard not to go down that route. I'm going to try to keep the posts in this blog "close to the metal"undressed, raw, honest, and candid.

Oh, and I'll try to stop writing about writing, because it's a ridiculously recursive exercise, and achieves very little. I could liken it to Jazz, but then some black-shirted high-brow twerp would probably start tutting.

In-between running errands this morning I realised I would only be a few minutes late for work if I dropped into our local mobile phone store to grab the Windows Phone I wrote about a few days ago. The idea focussed itself because I forgot to charge my phone overnight, and quite predictably it was running on fumes this morning.

Let's remind ourselves why I am even looking at mobile phones.I listened to music on an old iPod on the way to and from work yesterday. I was too busy to mess around with my phone much during the day, and then only used it a small amount in the evening to send instant messages back and forth with friends. After 24 hours of minimal usage, it was dead. The handset might be a supercomputer, and the screen might be the size of a multiplex cinema, but if the battery is flat, it's no better than a very expensive coaster for my coffee mug.

Right. Back on with our story.

I walked into the mobile phone store within moments of them opening for the day, and asked if they had any Lumia 640's in stock.

Nope.

And I walked back out of the store. You were expecting a big rambling story about my conversation with the girl behind the counter that didn't really know anything, weren't you. Sorry to disappoint. It looks like my trade in now won't happen at least until the weekend. I'm hoping to take our eldest to see Jurassic World at the cinema - we will walk past a number of phone shops en-route.

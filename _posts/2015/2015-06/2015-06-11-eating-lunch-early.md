After finishing dealing with some work this morning (read: headbutting my desk repeatedly and swearing profusely under my breath), I suddenly realised that it might in fact be lunchtime, and I could down-tools and eat the disappointing lunch I made for myself before leaving the house this morning.

I looked at my watch. 11:15am. I started doing mental calculations to figure out how hungry I would be later in the afternoon if I ate my lunch immediately. Thankfully an email arrived in my in-box that distracted me for the next ten minutes, distracting me from thoughts about food, and drawing the arrival of lunchtime ever closer.

At the moment my lunch is kind of like Schrodinger's Cat. Even though I made it this morning in a hurry while also making the children's breakfasts and lunches, in my head it's a wonderful lunch that will shut me up for a good few minutes while I eat it far too quickly. It will remain wonderful until I open my sandwich bag, and discover the tattered excuse for a sandwich, squashed forlornly under an orange. At the moment it is both wonderful, and not wonderful.

I've just spent five minutes writing this. Five minutes closer to lunchtime. Five minutes closer to face-filling resolution of the quantum mechanics sandwich thought experiment that has now appeared on so many TV sitcoms that everybody knows about it.

I guess if I wander down to the kitchen I could make everybody a coffeethat would use another five minutes up.

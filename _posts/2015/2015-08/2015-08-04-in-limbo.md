It's the day after breaking the news of my father-in-law's death. I'm in a curious kind of limbo - making breakfasts, packed lunches, doing chores around the house, and trying to make life simple for my other half where I can. I will return to work tomorrow, but for the moment I am too distracted to really concentrate on anything. It feels like I'm building a road ahead of the rest of my family, and trying to make it stable and smooth before they reach the next bit.

The washing machine is on (again), the lawn is cut, the kitchen is clean, the lounge is tidy, and the children are at their activity camp, which I will pick them up from at 3:30pm.

Everything feels strange. Disconnected.

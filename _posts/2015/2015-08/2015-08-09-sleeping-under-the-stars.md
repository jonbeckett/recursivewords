Our younger children slept out under the stars last night (my idea). I checked the weather forecast and suggested it. I think the deciding factor was the suggestion that they could sleep on the trampoline.

"YES!"

So guess you got to sleep on the couch, with the windows and doors open, in case they needed me.

Also, guess who was awoken at 5:30am by two children attempting to bounce on the trampoline in sleeping bags, and giggling hilariously at their own antics (I put a stop to it before one of them torpedoed their way out of the trampoline netting).

Holy crap balls though - I've been up for over an hour, got them in, made them hot drinks, switched cartoons on for them, folded all their blankets up, and it's still only 6:40am

Wehead out of England to the coast on Wales on Friday night, and then catch the first ferry to Ireland on Saturday morning. We have rented a cottage in County Clare, a couple of miles from Kilkee on the south west coast. At present ourhouse is filled with piles of washing, empty suitcases, and various devices on charge.

We will be sufficiently remote that we are predicting little or no internet access while away. I'm charging the Kindle, and have filled it with an assortment of books. We're taking board games, movies, walking boots, and raincoats.

After reading the guest houseitinerary, I'm guessing "TV for use with DVDs only" means there is no television signal - which probably means no mobile phones either.

In a way it's going to be good to get away from everything. Our daily life is infestedwith communications with anybody and everybody at any given moment. "Going dark" will be a reminder of perhaps 20 years ago, before the internet took over all of our lives.

Kicking my heels at home again. I was supposed to be working from home today, but one of our children was spectacularly poorly last night. My other half had to go to the solicitors (lawyers, for those in the US) to go through more paperwork. I'm guessing there's more paperwork involved in telling the world that somebody has passed away, than there is when somebody is born.

Of course Miss 10 (she who chundered from both ends spectacularly in the night) was fine by mid-morning, so I made her a packed lunch, and sent her on her way to the holiday activity camp she's being at so far this week.

I have two hours until the kids return home. It's hardly worth getting my work laptop out now - by the time I get involved in doing anything, it will be time to put it all away again.

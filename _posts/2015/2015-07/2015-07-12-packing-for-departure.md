I'm packing my bags today to travel with work - a five hour journey across the country this evening to Preston in Lancashire - the north west. Just to make things fun my other half has vanished for the day, and won't return until late this evening - so all manner of machinations are going on to fit in my work travel, and looking after the children. They too have bags packed in order to go to dinner at friend's houses this evening, and then have a sleepover ahead of school in the morning.

Although I say I'm "packing" my bags, in reality they are already packed. I'm just charging various devices up, and wondering what I'll forget to pack. I haven't put a wash bag together yet, but I don't need much - deodorant, toothpaste and a toothbrush, a shaver, and a hair brush. I'll use the hotel shower gel.

Clothes wise I'm taking one pair of trousers to last the 4 days of the trip, and a clean shirt and t-shirt for every day (and one spare). I guess I should take a raincoat just in case.

The backpack is filled with all the electrical stuff - my work laptop and it's charger, the Kindle, phone charger, and the bluetooth keyboard. I'm going to try out NOT taking the netbook with me, and just use the Kindle if I wander down to the bar on an evening (remember I warned you I turn into an insufferable blogging machine when stuck on my own in hotels).

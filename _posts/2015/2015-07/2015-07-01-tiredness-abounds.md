I'm not entirely sure how I'm still awake. At 3am this morning one of our daughters called out quietly from her bedroom doorway, and woke me instantly in the way their voices do when something is really wrong. She had been very ill indeed.

Ten minutes later I found myself downstairs with all of her bedding and pyjamas, throwing them in the washing machine. She called out again at 3:30am, and again at 4am. The final time I returned to bed my other half woke up. I don't remember what I dreamed about during the final minutes of sleep before the alarm erupted at 7am. I do remember squinting at the minutes ticking by until I knew I absolutelyhad to get up.

Staying up all night with a sick child isn't in the "bringing up children" instruction book. It's scribbled on a piece of paper, slotted into the back cover.

I guess the day would also have been a lot easier if said child had gone to school. I got a panicked phone call in the office at 11am from my other half, asking if I could possibly work from home (pretty please). Given the nature of my work at the moment, she was in luck.

The day would also have been easier if whoever is in charge of the weather hadn't turned everything up to 11 today. It was nearing 30C when I arrived in the office shortly before 9am, and has only got hotter since. Oh, and humidity is running at 40%. Fun. Not.

While wandering around town yesterday, I bought a sketchbook for myself. I haven't drawn athingin about ten years - which is a shame, seeing that I sat through two years of art lessons a long time ago, drawing people day-in, day-out. I used tolove drawing people - probably because they are by far the most difficult subjects.

Over the years I've kind of become scared of drawing, because I know how good I used to be, and I know how annoyed I will be if I draw something and it turns out rubbish. Tonight I managed to disregard such thoughts for a while, andjust draw. Of course, given my recent obsession with comic book artwork, I had to draw Harley Quinn. There's some logic there somewhere, honest.

First thoughts after drawing it are that the face is slightly wrong - the line of the mouth is weird. Also, who knew that drawing comic book character boobs would be so damn hard? If you go a tiny bit too big, they look ridiculous, and if you lift them too much they look stupid, and then... how big IS too big? And do you draw a nipple?

Anyway... there you go - Harley Quinn. First drawing in I can't remember how long. Let's see if it takes me another 10 years to draw anything.

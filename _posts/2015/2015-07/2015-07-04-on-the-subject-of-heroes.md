This morning I wandered up to the middle school summer fete, arriving in time to see our younger children take part in a dance performance. After making conversation with various friends, a whisper rumbled across the field - "they're coming!"

Squinting off across the school playground, I could see a line of children in leggings and hoodies walking towards the field, lead by their teacher. I have never known anybody like her. People talk about children having heroes all the time, but I doubt the children yet realise how much of an impact she has had on their lives. I wonder if she knows how much of an impact she has had on their lives either.

I've mentioned before about our youngest having developmental delays while growing up. Over the years she has steadily fallen behind her peers. It's maddening in a way, because the effort and energy she expends in efforts to please her dance teacher, football coach, and swimming coach are unbelievable at times.

There was a moment in a recent "end of year dance show" where our youngest had to skip across the stage. We all take skipping for granted. It took our youngest sevenyears to crack. After seven years of trying she proudly skipped across a stage, under the floodlights, in front of an audience of parents that had no idea - nobody had any idea other than her parents, and the dance teacher.

I guess this post is a quiet thankyou. A thankyou to an inspirational teacher that we are privileged to call a friend. I wonder if she has any clue how much of a legendary figure she is in our house ?

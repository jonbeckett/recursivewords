It's heading towards 1am as I sit at the computer. It has rained all day here - from the moment I arrived in the office this morning. It is still raining now, 15 hours later. I'm surprised there is any water left in the sky to fall on us (and before you explain how weather patterns work, I know perfectly well - I'm just being abrasive).

I got a lootcrate today! We thought my subscription had run out, but it turns out they just keep sending them, and there is no way to stop them because the "contact" link on their website doesn't work - so until we do manage to tell them to stop, I'll be getting a cardboard box full of junk each month. This month's box was FAR better than last month. I have the best Batman bottle opener now.

I'm struggling to come up with anything to write about - when I travel it's easy, because you are always surrounded by oddball characters - when you're at home you're just going through the motions - washing up, tidying up, and so on. I've written about being at home too much recently. I need some new adventures - you can only write about life if you experience life. Sitting in front of a computer all day doesn't really help.

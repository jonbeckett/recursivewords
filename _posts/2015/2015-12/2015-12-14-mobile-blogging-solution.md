I've had a Kindle Fire tablet for the last few yearsit was originally bought for the children, but then got "handed down" to me when they moved on to bigger and better things (tends to happen a lot in our house). I have to admit I have been surprised at just how much I use itparticularly while travelling. We have an Amazon Prime account at home, so it invariably gets filled with all manner of movies, television shows, and music before travelling with work. As a content consumption device it's pretty much without equal.

There is one application that I would never have anticipated the Kindle Fire being good at thoughblogging. More by luck than judgement, I discovered that you can turn the Kindle Fire into a pretty damn good portable word processor. Here's the things you need; Kindle Fire or Fire tablet Kindle Fire folding case, that allows it to be propped up Bluetooth Keyboard EvernoteYou see, it turns out that when Android (the operating system underlying the Fire OS built by Amazon) sees a Bluetooth keyboard, it transforms itself very neatly to use it rather than an on-screen keyboard. It behaves the same way with bluetooth mice tooa pointer suddenly appears on the screen. Leaning over to touch the screen isn't such a big problem though, so having a keyboard only is fine.

You might wonder why I've listed Evernote instead of the native Android WordPress app. Purely because it works very welloffline. I'll admit I haven't tested the WordPress app offline, but I suspect it will have issues. I can type all day using Evernote while the tablet is in "Aeroplane Mode", and it happily saves locallyready to sync when it gets a network connectionthen it's a simple case of copying and pasting from Evernote into WordPress. Hardly difficult.

I should probably do a shout-out for the cheap Logik bluetooth keyboard I typically use. It's fantastic. It wasn't the absolute cheapest in the high street electrical stores, but it was nearlyand it feels great to type on.

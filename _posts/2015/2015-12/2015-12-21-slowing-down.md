The children have finishedschool, I have finished work, and we are finally slowing down. The groceries arrived today. The presents are bought (but not all wrapped yet), and for the first time ever we have reservations to eat at a pub in town on Christmas Day.

Our final "hurrah" is a visit to Legland tomorrow, to see Father Christmas. The kids know we are headed out for the day, but they have no clue where we are going, and it's driving them nuts.

I've lost count of the number of times I have wandered to and from town over the last few days on errands. This afternoon I set off in search of batteries and lightbulbs. The day before saw me looking everywhere for a Girl Guides annual that it turned out didn't exist.

For two days in a row we have been met with a succession of Amazon deliveriesamong them a present from my Dad for me that isn't really a Christmas present at all. A few days ago "Flight Simulator" came up in conversation on Facebook, and I mentioned that we didn't have a good enough joystick to play it. Half an hour later we were informed that one was on it's way to us. Now I just need to find time to try it out.

For the last couple of days I've been wobbling with this whole "blogging" thing again, if I'm honest. I know not to react, because this happens every so oftenbut I am wondering about switching the identity of this blog back to "Recursive Words"the name I always had in the past. I like it better than "Recursive Codex". I have the URL "kentthebanjocat.wordpress.com"not something I can say about recursivecodexand the OCD part of me likes having things neat and tidy. I guess it's a bit like building a Minecraft building, and making sure even the bits you can't see are "correct". I'm mad. I know.

Anyway. Christmas is nearly here. Time to start getting drunk. It's traditional.

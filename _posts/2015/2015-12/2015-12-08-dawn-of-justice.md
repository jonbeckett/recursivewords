Late last night I was doing the rounds of the social networks before turning in for the night, when I happened upon the latest trailer for the upcoming Superman vs Batman movie.[youtube=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fis-9Zqu2Ro&w=640&h=390]Lots of people seem to be complaining about the spoilers in the trailerbut they are forgetting that this is a movie based on a book (a comic book in this case). While the movie might be billed as "Superman versus Batman", it's real title (and tagline on the posters) is "Dawn of Justice".

What does "Dawn of Justice" mean? It's the beginning of the "Justice League"the DC comics equivalent of the Avengers. People are going to walk into the cinema expecting a fight between Batman and Supermanand that's what they will get for the first half of the movie. Then everything they know will get turned upside down. Get ready for a raft of new movies starring The Flash, Green Arrow, Aquaman, Green Lantern, Shazam, Wonderwoman, and more.

I'm just looking forward to showing the Dawn of Justice trailer to our children. They will flip out when Wonder Woman makes her entrance.

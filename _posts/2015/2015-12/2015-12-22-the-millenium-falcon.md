For our last hurrah of the year, we took the children to Legoland todaywe are fortunate that we live about half an hour away from the UK park, and they are open for a few days over the Christmas period. We ordered the tickets some time ago, with the opportunity of visiting Santa at the park. We delivered the news to the kids via the Scout Elf this morning, via a letter from the North Pole.

We set off mid-morning with all the kids in the car, wandered around the bits of the park that were open, and went to see Santa. It's worth saying that the Santa visit was really well doneI was impressed with the craftiness of it all, to be honest.

We were lead into a Christmas tree maze by our personally assigned elf, and the children were given the opportunity to choose each turning. We ended up at a log cabin, and given the height advantage of being a grown-up, I realised what was going on. There were four or five identical wooden huts in a rowbut out of the eye-line of children. The elves were expertly guiding children in parallel to whichever of the Santas were free. Apparently the local primary school are thinking of doing something similar next year.

Anyway. We spent most of the day going on the rides that were open (including a new riding stables thing, where you cling onto a horse for grim death, and get swung all over the park while your 11 year old daughter screams non-stopand then want's to go on it again). We also ate junk, and drank free hot chocolate.

On the way out of the park I had agreed to let everybody spend some of my bonus money on some big LEGOkits. We've never bought any of the big kits before. It was really just an excuse for me to buy my other half the Millenium Falcon, which LEGO have just re-released as the "Force Awakens" version. She is the biggest Star Wars nerd I know, and has been sitting on the floor of the lounge for the last three hours, pouring over the plans, with little helpers finding bricks for each page of the instructions.

Upstairs our eldest daughter15is building the Shuttle Tydirium. On her own. I'm guessing they are all going to finish more or less at the same time. It feels weird to have spent so much on the LEGOkits, and not being involved at all in building them.

Keep an eye on my Instagram account for some photos of the finished spaceships.

I've not been online much over the last 48 hours, but it appears the people in charge of the Beatles back catalog have. Their music has appeared on all of the streaming services overnightmeaning Spotify just improved out of all recognition.

The first music I ever owned was a Beatles cassette tape, recorded from the "Red" albumthe "1962 to 66" gate-fold album that my parents owned. My Grandad had given me the (broken) tape recorder a few days before, and my Dad managed to fix it for me. It was the classic 1970s grey plastic tape recorder, with a row of mechanical buttons along the front, and a flip-top tape deck. Over the months that followed I played The Beatles tape to destruction.

In many ways the Beatles music has been a soundtrack to my life. They have always been there in the backgroundon the radio in the kitchen when I was young, on the record player during the 70s, on CD in the mid 80s, strapped to my waist in a Walkman in the 90s, and now streaming across the internet to my phone.

I remember watching an interview with George Martin years ago, where he described the competition between Paul McCartney and John Lennon to "out do" each other with each song they wroteto come up with more and more complex melodies. His exampleand it's not obviouswas "Here Comes the Sun". Listen to it carefullyevery note isoff the beat.

Anyway. Enough rambling. Time to go listen to John, Paul, George, and Ringo, and remember times past.

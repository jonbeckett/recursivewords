We are home.

We threw the kids in the car at about 7pm and set out from deepest, darkest Cornwall for the journey home. Within ten minutes all three were fast asleep. Good tactic, this night traveling lark.

We got home at 11pm and carried the children to their beds.

I return to work tomorrow - but not before getting up at 6:30am to go and buy milk from the local garage. I am anticipating everything taking twice as long as normal too - having just got home, clothes are in bags, and the entire contents of the car has been thrown in the playroom. We might get everything back in order by tomorrow - or maybe next week. Who knows?

I wonder what I'll be working on tomorrow?

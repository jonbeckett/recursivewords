W went out for a well deserved night out this evening with her best friend - leaving me to cook dinner, bath the kids, and get them to bed.

Everything was going fine until the eldest went into the bath - meaning I had to leave the younger two to their own devices for a few minutes while I washed hair.

There was an enormous crash, followed by crying from their bedroom. I left the eldest with her eyes clamped shut, head covered in shampoo, and stomped off to assess the situation.

One wardrobe open, one draw somehow halfway across the bedroom, one little girl (little miss buggeration) hiding under her bedclothes, crying very theatrically.

I think I said something along the lines of "how on earth did you manage to do that?", followed by "you knew you had to be good tonight, and I couldn't turn my back for 10 seconds, could I!"... at which point I realised I was starting to raise my voice, and stopped myself.

I put the draw back in and went back to hair washing.

Cue air raid siren crying from the bedroom. This causes me to return, and tell little miss buggeration in no uncertain terms to stop crying because there's nothing wrong with her. I sit her on my lap, explain that accidents happen, and that pulling draws out of wardrobes isn't an accident at all - and it coming crashing down is what happens. She maintains a steadfast stare at the floor throughout.

I finally return to the eldest's bath, and we finish up.

All kids go downstairs for 10 minutes of television while I then stick photos of the eldest's school teddy, "Clip Clop", into a special book where the child chosen to look after it over the weekend writes it up. The eldest then writes inbetween the photos - stopping on every third word to ask me how to spell it.

I just hope W has had a fun night out... we went out today, and with various other things going on we are now WAY behind with the washing. It seems if we go out anywhere for the day, it then takes a week or more to catch up with the washing and ironing.

Funny moment this weekend? Catching the eldest hiding in the toilet to avoid tidying up her toys... I opened the toilet door and said "how stupid do you think we are?" - cue some more staring at the floor...

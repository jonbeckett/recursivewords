On the whole, our local library is pretty pathetic, but while wandering around the isles in-between extricating our children from book destroying antics, I spotted "The Elfish Gene" in amongst the biographies. I might have to go back to the library tonight and find it - then sit up all night reading it.

It wasn't Dungeons and Dragons for me - it was 8 bit computers - but I can identify very closely with those who played with funny shaped dice in bedrooms up and down the land.

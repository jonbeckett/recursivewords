I am about to walk into town with the kids to return their library books and DVDs... and pay fines again.

I'm going to stop letting them get DVDs out. If I have to watch (or even listen to) another ten episodes of Strawberry Shortcake, I will set fire to the television. Seriously.

Their young lives are filled with Dora the Exporer, Peppa Pig, Arthur and the Invisibles, Curious George, and all manner of other animated inventions. Whatever happened to real actors?

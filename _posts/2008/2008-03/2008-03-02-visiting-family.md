Today was the girls first visit to W's parents house. I'm pleased to say it went really well, and I don't think we wrecked the place too much.

The only slight downer was our eldest nearly throwing up in the car on the way home. It's the first time any of the children have been ill, and she of course got pampered beyond belief when we got home. Her sisters didn't make an issue out of the attention she got either - which was surprising, and really great from our point of view.

After a big glass of milkshake, and being tucked up in front of her favourite cartoon (Ben 10) wrapped in a blanket for half an hour she came back to life. I remember being travel sick when I was young, and know how horrible it can feel. We got her to watch the road instead of her comic throughout much of the journey, and while it stopped her throwing up we felt really sorry for her.

This evening the middle child (I really must think up a suitable code-name for her) decided she needed to use the bathroom during her bedtime story each and every time she heard a noise on the upstairs landing. The final time I thought about stopping her going to the bathroom, but thought better of it. The last thing we need is the kids to start wetting the bed.

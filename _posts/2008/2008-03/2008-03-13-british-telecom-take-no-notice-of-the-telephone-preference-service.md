In the UK we have a national database called the "Telephone Preference Service" - if you are on the list it is illegal for anybody to try and cold-call you and sell you anything. We are on the list.

I just had the following conversation on the phone...

Ring ring, ring ring... I pick up

me - Hello?

him - Hello - is this Mr Beckett?

me - Yes.

him - My name is Abran, I am calling from BT.

me - What are you going to try and sell me?

him - I am not trying to sell you anything.

him - My name is Abran, I am calling from BT

him - Can you confirm you are Mr Beckett

me - I am.

him - Do you have a computer Mr Beckett?

me - Yes.

him - Do you have a dial-up or broadband internet connection?

me - You're going to try and sell me BT broadband, aren't you - so you ARE trying to sell me something

him - No, I wanted to tell you about the best deals we have on Broadband at the moment

me - I am signed up with the telephone preference service, and don't take cold calls. Are you aware you are breaking the law?

him - Sorry to have troubled you Mr... (I hung up)

Cold calling is the one time I will be intentionally rude to people.

We went shopping this morning with a store card filled by the people I work with (thankyou everybody - the girls will write a suitably embarrassing thank you card). We came home with a toy ironing board, iron, kettle, and various fake grocery boxes for the play kitchen we were given a couple of weeks ago.

When we got home the kids ran to fetch all their dolls clothes in order to get them ironed. We were also treated to five thousand toy cups of tea. I should perhaps mention that toy tea cups stink of plastic. I don't recall them smelling quite as bad when I was young, but if exposed to it for long enough, it makes you wretch. The smell of Play Doh on the other hand takes me back to being five years old.

Changing subject, while sat watching cartoons with the kids after dinner, the four year old turned to W and said "I miss the chickens" with the saddest look on her face. It was all me or W could do not to fall apart.

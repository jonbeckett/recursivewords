I have just got back from the school run. I did the whole routine myself this morning - got all three kids up, through breakfast, washed, teeth brushed, dressed, packed lunch made, myself washed and dressed, and then the eldest taken to school.

Before stepping into the shower this morning, I stepped on the scales. I am now lighter than I have been since I have known W... and lost nearly half a stone since I last weighed myself.

A curious thing happened the night before last - I was walking into town to get some groceries from the late night store - wearing running pants and shoes. It's worth mentioning that the local running race is on my mind - it's in May, and I've not started training yet. I'm not sure if some kind of funky memory kicked in or what, but while thinking of 1001 things while on the way into town I realised I had started running at some point, and had run nearly all the way.

Yesterday was hectic to say the least. We had a social worker visit to check on how we're doing, we put about 10 loads through the washing machine in preparation for going on holiday to the coast (for the girls to meet my parents at last), and on top of that a far flung friend has come to visit from the other side of the world for a few days.

This morning I'm taking the kids to the library to get them out of W's hair so she can get some packing done for the holiday. I think this afternoon myself and our house guest will take them to the park in town.

This evening I'm going to try and get out for a drink. I think I'll need it.

In between packing lunchboxes, getting dressed, and fielding "can we..." requests from our younger children this morning, W shouted from the kitchen "Catherine's going to be on the telly!"

The Catherine in question is Catherine Sanderson - the author of "Petite Anglaise"; one of the most successful personal blogs on the internet.

I'm wondering if Catherine's appearance will raise the profile of personal blogs once more. I have noticed a slide in recent months away from "slice of life" personal blogs towards those which are subject oriented.

I can sympathise with Catherine over her appearance on breakfast television - we appeared on it once while going through IVF treatment to discuss the issues (and subsequently had to promise never to do it again in order to progress our attempts to adopt children).

Going on television usually means getting up at an ungodly hour, being chauffeur driven across the country, having makeup plastered on you, sitting in a green room for an hour while various famous news readers dip in and out (stealing all the best biscuits while you say "wow! you're so-and-so!"), and then eventually you are dragged into the smallest studio in the known universe while a hassled sound woman jams microphone wires up your jumper.

Two minutes later (just as you are becoming comfortable talking to the host presenters), they hit a segway between features, and you are dragged back out of the studio, back to your chauffeur, and dropped back home. Quite how they fill two hours every morning with such interviews and features is anybody's guess.

Seeing Catherine on TV this morning is the first time I have seen a friend or acquaintance on television. I stood in the middle of the kitchen, various empty cups and plates in my hands, with the biggest smile on my face.

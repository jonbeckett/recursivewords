Since we have had the children, the weight has been falling off us. I am now lighter than I have been in years. Although I will not give W's weight away (I might fear for my life), she is lighter now than she has been in years too.

It the routine that's doing it - and spending three quarters of the day putting things away, washing things, answering requests, breaking up arguments, consoling losers, chiding mean spirited winners, and so on.

I'm wondering if this sudden return to a more healthy weight will help me in completing the local 5 mile running race this year (which I have still not started training for).

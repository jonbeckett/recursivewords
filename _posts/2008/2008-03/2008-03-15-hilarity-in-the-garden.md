Here's what just happened in the garden - witnessed while I was washing up and glancing out of the window from time to time...

Middle child gets off pedal-along tractor to ask at the door for a drink.

"Yep - when I've finished washing up"

Youngest happens to be walking past tractor, and gets on it.

Middle child returns to tractor - finds her sister on it.

Rather than find something else to do, she straddles the back of the seat and forces her little sister out of the seat.

Little sister goes rigid, bellows with quite some rage at her.

Middle child gets off - shouts to anybody who might hear "Not sharing!"

Middle child gets back on - tries to push sister off tractor again.

Little sister goes rigid - bellows even more determinedly... we are talking Tyrannosaurus bellows.

Middle child gets off and slumps down on swing seat - begins crying very loudly indeed.

I intervene - leaning out of the back door to tell her "pack it in - you know you have to share things"

She walks silently up the garden, and while passing the tractor leans towards her sister and shouts "Right then!" (with her hands on her hips)... and then shouts back over her shoulder while continuing on her way "I hate you."

Oh what dramas 3 and 4 year old children have to deal with.

With the advent of services such as FriendFeed and Pownce, I am wondering if this personal blog may eventually die - or at least become stagnant. With friendfeed, Flickr, and Delicious publishing my comments, photos, and bookmarks, it's difficult to know what huge tracts of textual rumination add to the mix.

Part of the attraction of blogging is the "I am a writer" thing. You can fool yourself among the little audience of regular readers that your opinion is valued - that your writing is thought about by others. Of course the reality is that a hard core of people who know you will read, but the great majority are only reading in passing - with a view to attracting you to their blog.

Perhaps I'm being cynical. Perhaps I'm not.

What do you think the future holds for your blog ?

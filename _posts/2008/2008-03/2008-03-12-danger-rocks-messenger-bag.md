After a delay of several months since I originally ordered it, my new messenger bag arrived this morning. I finally got a chance to look at it this evening, and am very impressed indeed.

I had been looking at messenger bags for a while - the one I used while commuting into London was fairly big - purposely so in order to carry the Macbook around. It has now become the Macbook's portable home, along with the MyBook, and is superb for that purpose. It leaves me without a bag to carry my stuff around in though - hence the new acquisition.

You might wonder what I tend to carry around with me - wonder no more...

A couple of magazines, A5 and A6 ruled Moleskine notebooks, fountain pen, rollerball pen, mobile phone, keys attached to a carabiner, USB memory key, digital camera, woolly hat, Nintendo DS (with games of course), and my Palm organiser.

My better half has reminded me while writing this post that should I happen to be taking our children out on my own I will need to substitute the magazines for colouring books, and the Nintendo for wet wipes. The Moleskine can stay to write down play-dates for the children with friends kids.

If you're wondering how easily it all fits, here's a picture of the bag filled with my various garbage...

One thing I do like about the Danger Rocks bag is that the flap zips shut underneath - so you can secure the insides if visiting somewhere crowded.

If you are interesting in getting one for yourself, visit the Danger Rocks website. I'm not sure if they are still doing it, but we have had a couple of steel mugs thrown in for free with our orders from them in the past too - bonus!

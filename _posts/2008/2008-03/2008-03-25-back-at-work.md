I am back at work this morning, and it feels very weird indeed. Can't write much - am busy clearing the backlog of emails, software updates and inquisitive colleagues.

This morning started at 6am - after arriving home from Cornwall at 11pm last night. First stop was the local garage to buy milk, followed by the normal morning routine - kids up, breakfast, get dressed, tidy kitchen, greet Wend with a cup of tea, and then - for the first time since we have had them - I left the house for work.

I am wondering how W is getting on without me there - and am nervous to call in case there is a nightmare unfolding.

The last few days have seemed like hard work - and I'm not really sure why. Perhaps it's the added complication of toast on a morning (we decided to give them cereal and toast for breakfast to prevent "I'm hungry" at 11am). The breakast therefore now takes twice as long as it did - and causes twice as much washing up. Suddenly 7am isn't early enough to get up - yes, I can get the kids up and turn them around in time for school, but it means I get nothing to eat or drink myself.

I made dinner last night to give W a break - each kid took turns to press her buttons during the afternoon. There was a risk of her carrying out saucepan fittings on their heads.

Thankfully today seems to be easier. Little do the kids know it, but I recorded them on video singing "Ip dip doo, doggy done a poo, who stepped in it, it was you!". It will appear on YouTube when I get a chance.

Funny moment of the day so far? Perhaps the 4 year old asking where her slippers were (without getting off her backside to find them). Her little sister ran off the search, and came running back through the house with them. I intercepted, took the slippers from her hands and put them back where they had been left (the playroom floor). I then marched back to the 4 year old and said "Why don't you go and find your slippers?". She ran off down the house, and started up the air raid siren. After no response from Mum or Dad she shut it down again a minute later - amid claims of "it's not fair!".

30 seconds later we heard "I can't put my slippers on!" from the other end of the house - to which I replied "that's a shame".

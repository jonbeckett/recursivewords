I received news today that one of my closest friends is climbing out of perhaps the bleakest time of their life.

I find it amazing how news relating hope and happiness lifts so strongly. In the face of tiring and stressful days, a few words mean a lot.

In some ways there is a guilt associated with not finding the time to ask "are you okay?" - and not finding the time to listen. I had become so wrapped up in our new life that I had lost sight of some of the people who matter.

A few words can be a powerful thing.

Have just been reading the O'Reilly C# book, and came across a story I have seen before, but it always makes me laugh, so I thought I would share it...

It happened that a famous scientist was telling a story about primitive creation myths. "Some people", he said, "believe the world rests on the back of a giant turtle. Of course, that raises the question: on what does the turtle rest?"

An elderly woman from the back of the room stood up and said, "Very clever, sonny, but it's turtles, all the way down".

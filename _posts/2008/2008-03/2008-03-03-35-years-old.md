Here's what I got for my birthday from Wend...

Many thanks also go to my brother in law, who got me a fantastic t-shirt which proudly tells people that more people have seen the shirt than my blog (it even has a hit counter, registering 2 hits). Somehow he always has a knack of finding things that I think are great.

There have been moves afoot within our house to make something secret. Normally I would be oblivious to such events, but a certain four year old informed me the other day in a very loud whisper "we're making you a birthday cake, but I can't tell you because it's a SECRET!" - followed by a very serious look with a finger held over her lips.

We left the house at 6:30am on Friday morning. After waking up following repeated bouts of car sickness over the course of our 5 hour car marathon on Friday morning, our four year old announced loudly to anybody who would listen "we are going to the seaside, and I am SO excitedwonderfully. Their discovery of a bedroom filled with toys, dolls, and dressing up clothes was greeted with surprise and awe. Unfortunately their first encounter with two 170lb Newfoundlands didn't go anywhere near as well... well, it went well right up until one of them licked the youngest's entire face in one swipe and caused hysterical screams and tears.

Tomorrow we return to our routine filled house where everything has a place, and rules guide each day. We have to continually remind ourselves that this is the children's first big trip - their first extended time with wider family, and so many new experiences. Open fires. Big dogs. The sea. More Grandparents...

The exited screams when the sea rolled over their wellington boots was something to behold - as were tears following the laughter when the eldest discovered that sea water is cold, wet and pretty uncomfortable when you are soaked with it.

At the moment our actions seem to be guided by feeding the children enough rope to get into trouble - and being there to pick them up. The rows of sea soaked clothes following our trips down to the beach are evidence of all kinds of adventures that hopefully they will remember for years to come and will build a platform for future confidence, spirit and mischief.

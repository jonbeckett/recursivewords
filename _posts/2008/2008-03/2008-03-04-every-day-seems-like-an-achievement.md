At the moment, every single day seems to be an achievement to be earned. We have still not survived a single day without a tantrum from one of the children; and while we were expecting the boundaries to be tested, we didn't think it would happen over such petty things.

Tonight the eldest threw a floor kicking wobbler on her return from school because we wouldn't let her wear a summer dress that arrived in the post today - never mind the fact that the temperature was tending towards zero outside. She didn't come out of her room for an hour.

The food wars calmed down a little today. Our usual nemesis could only be enticed to eat broccoli (which she has eaten before) when faced with everybody else being allowed her favourite pudding. At lunchtime she took half an hour to eat a quarter of one sandwich, then 30 seconds to make a huge wodge of birthday cake vanish. We find it hard not to laugh...

This morning the younger children asked to walk with us to school and back. We hadn't planned on there being a blizzard at the half way point. It became so bitterly cold that I carried the youngest most of the way home - and had to then wrap her in blankets as she cried when we got home. I remember crying from cold hands when I was young too - not fun.

I am completely aware that I've written this post in reverse order. I don't know why, and I haven't enough brain power left to reconstruct it.

Please excuse me while I watch rubbish television and then fall into bed.

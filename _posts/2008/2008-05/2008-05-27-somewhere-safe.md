While filling various sports bags with clothes in readiness to go camping this afternoon, we glanced from the upstairs window and spied a certain little cat who had discovered a new high place to sit from which to survey his domain and plan retribution against any who might dare to cross it's borders.

Perhaps it's a coincidence that several small children who torment the cat during each of their waking hours cannot reach the roof of the car.

The cat isn't stupid.

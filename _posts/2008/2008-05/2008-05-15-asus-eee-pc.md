After finding out that I will be travelling into London again as of next week, I lashed out on a replacement for the Macbook (which has become a "family" computer) to hopefully keep me sane while sat on the train.

So what is the Asus EEE PC ? It's damn small, and it's damn good value - that's what it is.

Here's the specifications of the one I just bought...

Size - 22.5 cm x 16.5 cm x 3.5 cm

Weight - 0.92Kg

Processor - Celeron M 353

RAM - 512Mb

Storage - 4Gb

I also bought an 8Gb SSD card to go in it - which will effectively triple the built in storage. The main uses of the machine will be writing on the way to and from work (emails, blog posts), and the odd conversation with friends.

When it arrives (hopefully Saturday) I will record it's unboxing here for those of you who have also been thinking about getting one. It's worth pointing out that EEE PC's cost about a third the price of a Macbook...

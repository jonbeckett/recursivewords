For the curious - applications are...

Snackr (scrolling news ticker, reading all my RSS feeds)

Twhirl (fantastic twitter client)

Pownce (lovely messaging client)

Pidgin (cross protocol IM client)

Thunderbird (email client - using IMAP to connect to GMail)

Of course, I use Firefox to browse stuff.

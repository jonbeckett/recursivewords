For the benefit of those who live in various other places around the world, I thought it might be fun to do a photo journey from the office to home, using my mobile phone to snap photos along the way.

There would be more photos, but traffic isn't the best place to be riding one handed with a mobile phone in your hand (not that it stops drivers of course - even though it's illegal in the UK).

Leaving Harleyford

The office where I work is located deep in a country estate on the bank of the river Thames. There is a golf course, a marina, and some really great walks to be had if you need to get out at lunchtime.

Nearing Town

Leaving the surrounding countryside, and nearing the town I live in - Marlow, in Buckinghamshire.

Station Road

Typical view of a typical street in Marlow - mostly Victorian houses in this street, with a few from the 1930s and 40s dotted around too. I would have had more photos of town, but it was somewhat difficult taking my hand away in the middle of the traffic to take photos.

Suburbia

In the back roads, approaching home. Quiet suburban streets in a very "middle England" town.

Home!

3 miles after I started, and I arrive at our house - which is deceiving because it's on the corner of a green - so is wedge shaped... much bigger than it appears.

The ride home takes a little over ten minutes if I'm feeling energetic, but typically nearer 20. For those who are interested, I have a GT mountain bike with disc brakes and rock shocks. Now you know.

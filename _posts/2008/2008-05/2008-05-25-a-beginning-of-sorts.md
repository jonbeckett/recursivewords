Get the trumpets out. Blow them pretty hard. With no further ado, no quarter spared, and a promise of no further clichd figures of speech, I bestow "The Enormous Waste of Webspace" unto the interwebs.

There. I've done it. And in the first two paragraphs of this... this paragon of prose, I have managed to break just about every grammatical rule possible. I would say "start as you mean to go on", but that would be another figure of speech, wouldn't it.

You want the truth?

I missed having my own blog. My place. A place I could monkey with. Somewhere to write garbage, spout ill conceived notions, and dismantle on a regular basis. Yes, WordPress can host blogs for you, but it's nowhere near as much fun as cobbling something together yourself and calling it your own.

So here I am.

I'm back. And I have a pretty damn silly domain name too. Look forward to much wafflage, rumination and speculation about life, the universe, and what's for dinner. Make no mistake - these are the great questions of our time.

Don't just sigh and mutter "oh God, Jonathan's started yet another bloody blog..." - this is THE blog. It will eventually replace everything else I do online. It will eat the other blogs for breakfast. With gusto.

Go on - post a comment - you know you want to.

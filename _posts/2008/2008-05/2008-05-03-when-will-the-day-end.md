Here's what's happened and/or what I've been up to so far today, in some kind of chronological order.

Got up at 6am after the girls decided it was time to scream, shout and cry at the top of their voices (and their voices are LOUD)

Arranged movies and colouring books to placate children while I jump in shower.

Watched MotoGP qualifying on the TV while also putting away 1001 toys, comics and colouring books

Put the dishwasher on

Washed up the things that didn't fit in the dishwasher

Made breakfast, while listening to news on the radio that Boris Johnson is the new Mayor of London

Washed up breakfast things

Help download eldest's photos from her disney digital camera (which W is losing her temper with at great speed).

Set about tidying up the study - which has become a free-for-all dump of anything and everything

Retrieved the lawn mower from the shed, and set about cutting the grass for the first time this year. Not aided by having to put away 100 hoops, footballs, frisbees, and so on before firing up the mower. Also answered 30 second questions of "is it finished yet" - answered by "does it look like it?" - we have a big garden too... 100ft long by 50 foot wide at the widest point.

Pitched "Quick Pitch" tent for the kids to play in on the freshly cut lawn

Sat down to eat lunch

Washed up lunch things.

Pitched our new family tent in the garden - so big I can only just carry the bag for it safely. Joint effort (and a couple of tantrums) saw W and I get it put up, and wide eyed children run around inside it.

Stop for cup of tea, and admire children's antics on the swings in the back garden

Pull big tent back down and figure out how to put it back in the bag.

I return indoors, and set about tidying up the carnage created by the kids since breakfast time.

Another cup of tea

Return outside, pull down quick pitch tent, and tidy garden back up (again)

Back inside, check email

This is a fairly normal day... no wonder we sleep well. It's only 5pm.

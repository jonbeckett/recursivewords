For those who were not aware, I am back working in London. This means getting up very early, spending several hours commuting each day, and returning very late. I basically get to see our children for about half an hour each evening during the week if I am lucky.

Hopefully (if you are a regular reader) you will understand that posts here might not happen as regularly as they have in the recent past.

Finding myself sat in an office a long way from home, or squashed onto trains for several hours each day has forced me to become inventive in how I keep up with those on the internet that I like to keep up with. Here's how I'm doing it...

Twitter (www.twitter.com)

I'm using Twitter to post random thoughts throughout the day. It's simple, and it works. If you've not tried it, you really should. Posts are typically one sentence long.

FriendFeed (www.friendfeed.com/jonbeckett73)

By far the most useful aggregator tool on the internet - giving me a very fast way to keep up with the content my friends are generating. It's your easiest way to find out what I am doing everywhere too.

The Enormous Waste of Webspace (www.ewows.net)

A site I began fiddling with some time ago, but never did anything with. It may become my homepage on the internet... who knows. At the moment it's surfacing my FriendFeed.

It's looking like I'm back off to London for a few days each week to work with the same people I worked with last year.

My main immediate concern is going to be W. I'm the person who invariably gets up at 6:30 each morning and makes the packed lunches, breakfast, clears the washing from the previous night, and leaves the kitchen in a useable state. Suddenly I'm not going to be there for 3 days mornings, and not be there for 3 nights to help with bath time (unless we start putting them to bed later?).

I'm wondering how it's going to work. I'm wondering if to ask for more money to balance the havoc it's going to cause.

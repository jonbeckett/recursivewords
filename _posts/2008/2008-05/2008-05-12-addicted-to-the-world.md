If you, like me, find yourself reading blogs in [insert RSS reader here], looking at friend's photos on Flickr, following Facebook, and messing around with Twitter and Pownce inbetween doing things you should be doing, you might be interested in FriendFeed.

It's the most wonderfully lazy invention on the internet in ages - and a kind of derivative of everything else. You plug all the RSS feeds generated by the likes of Twitter, Pownce, Flickr, Delicious, Facebook, MySpace and so on into FriendFeed, and it makes one gigantic news feed of "you" - from everywhere, for everybody.

You can see mine at... http://friendfeed.com/jonbeckett73.

Notice you can also comment on stuff in FriendFeed, and follow friends. All clever stuff, and lets us all be a bit more lazy - which is no bad thing.

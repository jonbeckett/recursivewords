This evening is filled with preparations for my return to London in the morning - preparations to get up at some ungodly hour, and join a two hour (each way) commute into the heart of the city.

I am waiting for my iPod Shuffle to sync. It will be populated with the following albums;

Rockferry, Duffy

Long Road Out of Eden, Eagles

The Trick to Life, The Hoosiers

Somewhere Back in Time, Iron Maiden

Under the Iron Sea, Keane

The Age of the Understatement, The Last Puppet Show

Hard Candy, Madonna

In Silico, Pendulum

Still Feels Good, Rascal Flats

Jumping All Over the World, Scooter

Scouting for Girls, Scouting for Girls

Phantom Power, Super Furry Animals

The Sole Inhabitant, Thomas Dolby

The Velvet Underground and Nico, The Velvet Underground

Bit of a mixture, isn't it? Some new stuff, some old stuff, and some easy going stuff. Some music with memories wrapped around it, and some with memories yet to be written.

My clothes are hanging up. My shoes are clean (but falling apart), my phone is on charge. Just my bag to pack really - ready for a 7am getaway. I will be getting up at something like 5am in order to make the kids lunch and set breakfast up - to make life as easy for W as possible in my absence.

This is going to happen for 3 out of every 7 days for the next few months. I don't really want to even think about that at the moment.

While at a loose end a few nights ago I wandered towards E-Bay in a dangerous manner, and ended up buying a Gameboy Advance SP for myself.

... along with Mario Kart Super Circuit, Legend of Zelda (Minish Cap), CT Special Forces, car charger, link cable, and travel bag. While getting everything out of the bubble wrap, I felt something in the travel bag. Nestled in the bottom of the pocket was "The Sims 2" for the DS - which got donated to W immediately (she is playing it right now).

I'm not really sure why I bought it. It was cheap! It's in mint condition though - and given the free game we got with it, it's been a bit of a windfall.

There's something about playing video games on the hardware they were designed for. The temptation now is to stay away from E-Bay after looking at a list of the 25 best games for the Gameboy Advance over at IGN.

Its late (the day after), so I'm not going to spend a great deal of time writing the story up tonight - suffice to say our tent suffered structural failure, and we drove through the night in torrential rain to bring the children home safely.

Amazingly the children stiill think camping was great fun - mainly thanks to a sunny first/only morning, and the chance to play with the other children on the campsite.

We visited wookie hole, a wonderful cave system below the westcountry hills, and the girls were suitably apprehensive about climbing several hundred metres below the surface of the earth into caves, caverns and subterranean rivers.

Like I said - I'll write more when we have cleared the backlog of ruined clothes, damaged tent poles, sleeping bags, coats and boots.

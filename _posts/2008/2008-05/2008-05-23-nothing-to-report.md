If you are wondering why there have been few blog posts from Beckett Towers over the last few days, it will be because of a lack of news. Rather than following the grand BBC tradition of reporting the same news again and again until everybody resorts to watching reality television shows, I'm not going to report anything.

How about a weather report? This morning there is a light drizzle...

... and it doesn't look good for the rest of the weekend. Or next week actually. We are going camping with the girls, and I think we may be sitting in the tent or the pub playing board games for a great proportion of the trip.

I'll try and think of something interesting to blog about...

I did ithad promised each other - half jokingly - that neither of us would train for the race this year. We bumped into each other a couple of weeks ago at our youngest's birthday party, and were both quite relieved that neither of us had still trained.

I surprised myself - after mentally thinking we might hold on to 10 minute mile pace if we jogged around slowly, we went through 2 miles in 18 minutes. We did pay for it though, and I suddenly found myself running alone at about the half way point. I'm guessing that's down to the weight I've lost since we've had the kids.

Going through the fourth mile I ran out of batteries and walked for a bit, but managed to get going for the last mile again - eventually crossing the line at about 52 minutes. If somebody had told me beforehand that I would finish the race in such extreme temperatures at all, I would have laughed. I'm guessing the temperature out on the course was somewhere around 25C (no idea what that is in Farenheit) - and it got hotter as the morning wore on.

I did it though - and it was the first event I've done since we've had the children. They didn't really understand the concept of me having a medal at the end, but it was great leaving the park at the start and having my own little stand of cheerleaders.

I also want to thank Glenn's family, who high fived me as I ran past their house on the run in towards the finish. It gave me all kinds of renewed energy...

Our youngest daughter - entering her 37th month on this earth - has reached a rather interesting stage in her attempts to communicate with the world around her.

She seems to have a range of stock phrases, which can be interchanged to converse about anything and everything.

In no particular order, the phrases are;

"Yeah"

"That One"

"That [person]" (e.g. "That yours", "That mine")

"[person] go to [place]" (e.g. "Dad go to work")

"[person], where are you?"

"where [person]?"

"Pardon me..." (typically after berping or trumping spectacularly)

"Like [thing]" (e.g. "like biscuit")

"And me 

"Did you bump into [sister's name]?"

"Yeah" (said in a plaintive manner)

"How did you hurt it then?"

"De de de Buggy [sister's name] de de hurt 

I then rub her head and send her on her way.

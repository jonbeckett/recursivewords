We are off camping tomorrow - taking the children on their first experience of the great outdoors (well... as much of the outdoors as the westcountry can summon).

We've been to the campsite before - a very quiet one in the middle of nowhere, with a store and all manner of utilities. It's going to be interesting to see what the kids get up to on the campsite - we are restricting them to a small backpack each to take toys with them, and will of course be taking some outdoor games in the back of the car.

A mile or so from the campsite is a small village with 2 pubs - so most evenings will be spent walking down for something to eat, and some fizzy drinks no doubt.

At the moment our house resembles some kind of utilities management company - devices seem to be on charge everywhere, clothes in piles everywhere, and shoes in neat lines in the hallway.

My strength will be tested later when I have to lift our new tent (which I can barely lift off the floor) into the roof box on the car. I guess I'll find out if I could have had a career as an olympic power lifter - I'm predicting not.

In preparation for the next few days, the girls have slept in their sleeping bags to try them out, and they have played in a "quick pitch" tent in the garden over the last few weeks. We're hoping against hope that they enjoy it - our favourite memories of childhood holidays are from camping.

There's a lot to be said for making your own fun instead of attempting to buy it.

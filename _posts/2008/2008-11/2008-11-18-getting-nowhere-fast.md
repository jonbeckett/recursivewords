I was in the office this morning for a couple of hours. Today's task was to extend the functionality of a pre-existing chunk of code - make it do something new. That meant getting the latest build of the software from the version control system.

The company I contracted to at the moment use PVCS as their version control system. Accessing it over VPN is liable to failure, flakiness, and random acts of sabotage on the part of PVCS itself. In order to get anything done today, I am trying to get the latest build of everything out - it's now 2:30pm and I'm still trying.

Part of the reason for this "get" of the code taking so damn long is that about 30% of the way through in the office, the network kicked me out - and I couldn't re-connect. I had to return home to get a connection, and start all over again.

At the time of writing, 1700 items have been checked in PVCS, and it's still going. I have no idea how long it will take, and I have to do a SECOND get after this one. I'm guessing I'm going to get NOTHING done today, unless I work all evening to get what I might have done during the day done.

Great.

Postscript... now 3pm, and running at 2050 items. Still no end in sight.

Post Postscript... now 4pm, and the second Get is running slowly... yawn

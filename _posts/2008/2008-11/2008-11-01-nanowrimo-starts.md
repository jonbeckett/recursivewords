It's officially the 1st November. Over the next month, if all goes well, I will write my first novel.

Make no mistake - it's going to be crap, but it will be a novel, and I can relax in the knowledge that I once wrote a novel.

I thought of something to base it on yesterday, and have all manner of ideas floating around the hard drive of this little laptop.

Fingers crossed. Here's to the next 30 days of attempting to turn out 1600 words(ish) a day. I somehow think it's going to be a lot easier or a lot harder than I imagine.

After receiving no feedback whatsoever, I took the slightly risky move last night of registering the domain name anyway because it was available - and once I had the domain name, it seemed a shame not to use it. You can therefore trudge over to the following shiny new website;

The Community of Bloggers

www.communityofbloggers.com

As many will know, and I mentioned yesterday, I created this community a couple of years ago but never gave it a proper home on the internet. While searching for any kind of blog writing community on Google a couple of days ago I was somewhat shocked to discover that none existed - or at least nothing sensible was returned while searching for "Blogging Community".

Feel free to go and register, and ask questions, post tips, and of course pimp your own blog.

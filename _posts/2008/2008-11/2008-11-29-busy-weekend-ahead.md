After a marathon week working on some of the most complex code I have written in years, the weekend has arrived, and there is going to be no let-up.

The house is unusually tidy on this Saturday morning - mostly because I have spent all morning so far tidying up, washing up, and putting things away. It would really help of course if the kids had any concept of putting things away when they finish playing with them. I'm guessing that might take another 20 years to instill in them.

Today is the School Bazaar. W spent most of the week making buscuits (with help/hindrance from the kids) to sell on stalls, and will be heading out this morning to help set up. I will be following with the kids after lunch and meeting her there - which reminds me - I must sort out some pennies from their money boxes for them to spend at the Bazaar.

Tomorrow the eldest has her swimming lesson, and then a friend's birthday party in the afternoon. We are also feeding our friends rabbits over the weekend.

Somehow in amongst all this I need to buy a load of rechargeable batteries for the Wii controllers.

If you were wondering about the image at the top of the post - we ordered ABBA Singstar for everybody to play at Christmas. Video of that might just find its way onto YouTube.

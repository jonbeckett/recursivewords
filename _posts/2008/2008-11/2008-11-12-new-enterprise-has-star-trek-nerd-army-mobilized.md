I haven't laughed so hard in ages. Here's the new Star Trek "Enterprise" (from the forthcoming movie);

... and here are some of the comments;

I am disappointed that Mr Abrams failed to stay true to the design of the Enterprise NCC-1701. Perhaps, he will impress those who don't care about that sort of thing, but I suspect there are many who will see the 'new' as 'not improved'. Paramount made a similar mistake with 'Enterprise, the series'. The NX-01 was supposed to predate the NCC-1701, but was base on a design from TNG

they should have left the Enterprise alone. I mean, honestly whats wrong with using the same design as the original just update so it looks all nice, new, and shiny.

The fans of TOS will raise hell when this comes out. The Original ship is Canon. The new one is not, therefore it sucks! No matter how cool it looks.

Ruined! Ruined! Ruined! What Have You Done???!!! This is not what StarTrek is supposed to be.

Please excuse me while I carry on laughing.

I've spent the afternoon drawing digital artwork for use as background for powerpoint slides. It's good to have such diverse skills and experience.

It's opening my eyes to the skills I hold, and the huge breadth of knowledge expected of a modern web developer though. You're expected to know not only how to wrangle HTML, but also client and server side code, design databases, and now draw digital artwork from scratch.

A few years ago each discipline would have been handled by one person or team - now (as a freelancer) you are expected to be good at all of it... or at least you expect yourself to be if you are me.

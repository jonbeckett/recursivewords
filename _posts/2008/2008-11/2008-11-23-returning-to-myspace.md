It's been tipping down with rain here today - and I've been sidelined with a rather nasty cold. Inbetween washing up, tidying up, and child wrangling, I've been looking in on MySpace - the first social network that really broke through to the mainstream. It's since been overtaken by Facebook, but both claim hundreds of millions of active users.

My main reason for visiting MySpace is of course (as with anything I tend to do) centered around a person - a very close friend on the other side of the planet I have neglected like most other things lately.

I was surprised by the progress MySpace seems to be making - it's still a mess, it's still chaotic, and it's still unstructured, but it's also less of a mess, less chaotic, and less unstructured than it once was. Perhaps most importantly, the site seems far more stable than previously. I just wish people would refrain from adding every last bit of crap to their profiles. One particularly bad one managed to reliably crash my browser.

If you're interested in taking a look at MySpace, don't expect it to be better than Facebook - because it's not - but feel free to head over to my profile;

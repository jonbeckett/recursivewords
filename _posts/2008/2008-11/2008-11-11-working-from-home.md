An eventful day so far (and night).

Our four year old has a bad cold, meaning she woke up at about 2 hourly intervals during the night crying. On more than one occasion she insisted there was a big scary monster in her room.

This morning W woke up with a bad arm - unable to lift it more than a few inches without immense pain.

End result - I am working from home, and helping as much as I can inbetween my usual brainiac activities with the work laptop.

Late last night I purchased more new hardware to assist in talking to freelance clients. A couple of my colleagues will start laughing when they find out what I bought...

16Gb USB Flash Drive - yep - you read right - 16 gigabytes. That's a LOT of room, right there on my keyring. Main reason for purchase is that I lost the end off my existing flash drive some time ago, and have been worried about it's survival for a while.

MyPassport 250Gb Hard Drive. It's a bit bigger than a box of matches, and will let me store a full image of the EEE PC along with several virtual machines. Perfect.

Slimline DVD Writer - which will allow me to burn discs when out and about. It also solves (inexpensively) the issue of accessing DVDs and CD-ROMs on the EEE PC.

It's 7:35am on Sunday morning, and I am dressed and downstairs with the younger children. As per usual they were up before 7, and despite numerous instructions not to, were on the landing (just outside out bedroom door) shouting at each other as loud as they could.

I quietly got up and emerged from our bedroom. The youngest shouted "Daddyfor some peace and quiet.

The eldest just appeared downstairs - washed, teeth brushed, and swimming costume on under her clothes ready for her lesson later. There does seem to be balance in the world after all.

I'll emerge a bit later to start making breakfasts, lunch for our little Swimming charge, and start another round of washing up.

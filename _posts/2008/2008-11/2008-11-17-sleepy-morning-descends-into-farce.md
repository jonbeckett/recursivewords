Yesterday (Sunday), the kids decided that 5am was a great time to be up and running around their bedroom, across the landing, and making as much noise as they possibly could. It's surprising how much noise a toybox and two little girls can make at 5 in the morning.

This resulted in the crankiest kids in the known universe by about 6pm last night. We therefore announced a huge change to the household rules, starting this morning. Nobody was to get out of bed until Mum or Dad were up.

On cue, at 5am, our three year old nemesis was up. I immediately sprang out of bed and told her to go back to bed. I had to tell her twice, and follow her to her bed. All was well.

At 5:30am she was back up again, and looking into our bedroom. Again I sprang out of bed, and told her to go back to bed. Escorted her back again.

At 6am, we woke to both the younger children's voices, so again I got up, and discovered them stood on their beds with every upstairs light switched on. I repeated the previous night's lecture about not getting up until Mum or Dad was up, and they dived back into bed. Little miss 4 years old looked pretty horror struck at the idea of not being allowed to get up yet, but (miraculously) didn't cry. I switched every light back off and went back to bed.

At 6:30am, voices again woke us up, and I returned to their room too find both out of bed again - this time hooking toys out off their toybox.

"Bed. Now. I told you both - you're not to get up until me or Mum are up"

They both run back, I switch off the lights (again), and return to bed.

Cue the 3 and 4 year old version of air raid sirens - and W exploding at me before stomping off into their room herself. I didn't hear all of the resulting conversation, but it ended with "stop crying! be quiet! pack that in! shoosh! no! it's not time yet! stop it! shoosh! look you two! shush! shut up!"

By the time she returned to bed, it was time to get up anyway.

Perhaps we'll try again tomorrow. Maybe give them a sticker if they stay in bed until we are up.

I just put a huge order in on the internet for clothes. Part of the wardrobe replacement that I tend to do every year or so.

This time the order has boots, training shoes, t-shirts, a hoody, jeans, a jacket, and polo shirt on it. For those interested in labels, we are talking about Bench, Caterpillar, and Timberland 

I now need to start throwing worn out clothes away, and give good clothes that no longer fit to charity. Since losing 2 stone over the last year, some of my old jeans look hilarious... like a clown.

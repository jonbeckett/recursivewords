Some of the regular readers here will remember me talking about "King of Shaves" shaving gel a couple of years ago, and the impact it had on me. While walking around Boots in Liverpool Street Station yesterday (where I buy my lunch from each day), I happened upon the "Azor".

I heard about this razor two years ago from the owner of King of Shaves. I had made flippant remarks about their marketing referring to the shaving gel as "software" - he privately emailed me to explain that the razor was "hardware", and that they might or might not have a project in the works.

Being the kind of person who will try new things just for the hell of it, I bought the razor. This morning was my first go with it.

So how good is the Azor ?

It's worth pointing out that my skin is pretty awful at the moment - the product of running out of Mach 3 razor blades a couple of days ago, and returning to an electric shaver (that makes your skin - on close inspection - look like your shaved with a surform).

The Azor is certainly different.

Rather than have the entire head pivot to meet your face, the arms holding the blades are flexible - with enough give to avoid cutting yourself. You tend to draw the razor across your face at a very shallow angle - again, a product of the head not pivoting - having four blades on the head means that this works remarkably well though, and you don't tend to even think about it cutting you.

Apparently the blades are coated with something special that will keep them sharp for some time - I'll have to report back on that. I'll also try and eat healthily for the next week or two to ensure my skin stays in good condition so I get representative experience to let you know how well the Azor works shaving every day.

As an aside, I used King of Shaves Alpha Gel to shave with, as I have been doing for the last few years. It's by far the best shaving gel I have ever found - and given that we are effectively scraping very sharp knives across our faces, the gel does a bloody marvellous job of avoiding decapitation.

p.s. I am not being paid by King of Shaves to write this - I just thought it might be of interest to others to read about something new. If of course the powers in King of Shaves towers read this, feel free to send me free goodies lol

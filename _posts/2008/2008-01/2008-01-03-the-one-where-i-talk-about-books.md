After reading Quarter Rest earlier, I realised it might be an idea to have a page here at PluggedOut about the books I am either reading, or have recently read - and so I waved my magic wand, and the page was brought into existence (www.pluggedout.com/books).

It's a fairly straightforward page really - it lists what I'm reading at the moment, and what I have read in the last few months. I have "borrowed" the synopsis for each book from Amazon, but am not going to link through to them - there is no point because you might be anywhere in the world, and will end up doing a search on your local internet bookstore anyway.

I realise that this small list of books is practically useless, and has no real world application - but I was bored, and thought it might be fun to provide even more information about my life for you.

I wonder - if enough information was provided, could an evil genius create a twisted clone of me?

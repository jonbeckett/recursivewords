I built two IKEA units today - a huge chest of drawers for our bedroom (to hopefully solve the problem of piles of clothes everywhere), and a full-height shelf unit for the play room - one that big storage boxes slide in and out of.

I now just have three stair gates to build and fit. Getting there slowly.

This afternoon I have been working on some programming code to help somebody out. It's PHP, which I've not written in for a while, so it took longer than I thought. Ho hum.

Roll on this evening, and a trip to the pub with W's brother. I need a drink.

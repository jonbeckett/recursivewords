I have just got off my bike after cycling to work (and no, the photo is not of me). The weather outside was just what I needed after having Flu throughout Christmas and a stomach bug yesterday - howling winds and driving rain. Despite wearing full waterproofs a car still managed to force me into a deep puddle which completely soaked my feet (the only part of me not covered in a supposedly water resistant covering). I now have soggy socks - the kind that slap around as you walk.

I am of course aware that I have written about being ill far too much so far this year, and so will stop doing so. Having something or other wrong with me has become the norm, so therefore is no longer noteworthy. I will write about other things. Interesting things. Annoying things. Funny things.

It feels great to have a private blog once more where I don't have to think about an audience, and can splurge thoughts straight out onto the page. You have no idea how much crap I have swilling around my head.

As we roll ever faster into 2008, and huge changes in our home and family life approach, I somehow feel compelled to make a list of the things I would very much like, but will never get - or at least I will never think of a reason plausible enough to warrant purchasing. Somehow I don't think robbing a bank or winning the lottery would change the viability of the contents of this list either...

A lot of thought has gone into this list. Well, perhaps thought isn't quite the word I'm looking for. A lot of letching certainly went on, some grumbling, and quite a bit of deflated wishful thinking.

Macbook Air

Yes, yes, I know we already have a Macbook, but have you seen the Macbook Air? It is a thing of beauty. In millenia to come, the great design schools will be revered - Vienna, Pininfarina, and Apple. Plus it's like the video on YouTube says - "Mac's get you laid"... or have I been lied to?

Nintendo Wii

Quite apart from the fact that no stores in europe have had any stock of them since they were launched back in Christmas 2006, I have been making furtive sideways glances at the Wii for quite some time. During a moment of weakness in a certain electrical store about six months ago I even enquired if they had any in stock (after estimating how much trouble I might get into if I repeated the episode where I went out to buy the newspaper and came back with an XBox).

Lazy Boy Chair

You saw the episode of Friends, didn't you? Where Chandler and Joey bought their armchairs? Can you even imagine sitting down to watch your favourite movie, pizza on your lap, beer in the built-in fridge, and recliner extended? I will strenuously deny any suggestion that I might fall asleep in such a chair before the movie finishes.

63C/3 Flat Screen Television

I'm not quite sure why this appeals so much, because there is absolutely no way it would even fit through the house, let alone into the lounge. I guess the argument goes something like this - why use the projector from work to paint the side of the house with Super Smash Brothers Melee when you could buy a flat screen that's as big as the side of the house anyway?

Kylie Minogue

I've run out of excuses. I know. It's an illness suffered by many men of a certain age (or so I am told by my better half, who is doomed to stalk George Michael for the rest of her days in a useless pursuit between various public restrooms in parks). I don't think she's technically for sale actually either, but imagine how impressed she would be with the flat screen!

You would think there would be more items on my list, wouldn't you. My thinking is that if there are not so many things, then perhaps I might have more chance? (this is getting a bit ridiculous, isn't it... what do you mean, it started out a bit ridiculous?)

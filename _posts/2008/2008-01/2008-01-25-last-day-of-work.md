The wonderful lady in the photo above is attending her last day of work today. For nearly 20 years she has been pursuing a career in accounting, and for the last few years has been burdened with perhaps the world's biggest geek following her around like a lost puppy. Today she leaves everything she knows behind and sets out on a new path towards being a parent.

I think she is very brave, and I love her to pieces.

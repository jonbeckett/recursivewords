Videos recorded to as part of a DVD for our future children to help them get through the next couple of weeks while waiting for the adoption introductions to begin - and to hopefully let them know us and where we live a little better. We also thought it might be nice to share with readers who live elsewhere in the world...

A Trip Into Town

A video walk through the streets of Marlow towards Higginson Park and the River Thames to see the canada geese and swans.

A Chicken Encounter

Wandering around a very muddy back garden in pursuit of our three cornish chickens (from Gwelva Kernewek's other half)

Enjoy!

Our future children were told of our existence today - told that they have a new Mummy and Daddy. Their foster carer broke the news early this afternoon armed with the scrap books and the DVD we put together to introduce ourselves.

It went better than anybody could have possibly expected - the problem now will be keeping a lid on the children's excitement - we still don't meet them until the end of the month. The month will seem like forever - both for them and us.

Such simple things were apparently hard for them to take in - a park outside the front door, grandparents who live at the seaside, a cat, a huge garden, pet chickens, brand new bedrooms, and of course a Mum and Dad...

I think somehow we may have trouble sleeping for the next few nights.

Following our marathon week of evenings out, and dinners with friends, we are rolling towards the end of the tracks today with perhaps the most interesting meet-up - but not before we ate so much yesterday we felt sick.

Yesterday was fun. The kind of fun you can only have with friends you kind of know are going to remain so for many, many years to come. We went out for lunch with she of "Blogapotamus" fame and her other half, The Rockstar to a place fairly local to us called "The Blacksmiths Arms" - an american themed restaurant on the outskirts of Wycombe.

We ate enough to feed a small army - and couldn't stop because it was so good. Seriously. We made the slight mistake of saying "large" when we ordered Nacho's to start, and almost laughed out loud when the dustbin lid sized plate emerged from the kitchen, replete with all manner of relish and dippy stuff. I'm pretty sure they shot a cow to make the burgers too.

No day out would be complete without a trip to John Lewis (huge department store, for those of you in the rest of the world), so we found ourselves buying nuclear protection for the dinner table, a new iron (after W spectacularly destructed ours the night before last), and began a fruitless search for egg cups. Of course the department store had them, but they only had "designer" ones - meaning they cost as much as we might pay for an entire tea set.

We ended up back home, walking down the high street to our local "Cargo" - another (cheaper) housewares store. We found the perfect egg cups for the kids, and also four or five other things we didn't know we needed until we saw them.

This morning I am up, have tidied the house up, had a wash and shave, let the chickens out, and am thinking about wandering into town to meet some new friends for a coffee - and as is typical of our chaotic life at the moment, one of our family is due to turn up meaning W will have to stay here; therefore meaning I am meeting new friends on my own.

Good job I am good at winging it in social situations... this is the first time meeting the girl that recognised me by my scarf on the train. I'm hoping W will make it into town in time to meet them because she's a knitter too.

In other news, we have just confirmed another friend and his son coming to visit for dinner and board games this evening. Do we win an award yet for fitting the most socialising into one week ever?

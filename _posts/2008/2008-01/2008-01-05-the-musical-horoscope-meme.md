I saw this first here, and then here, and thought "I have to try that"here are the rules, and the results

Rules

 1. Put your iTunes on Shuffle.            2. For each question, press the next button to get your answer.            3. You must write that song name down no matter what.          

Results

Q. What would best describe your personality?

A. If You Wanna Stay, by Keith Urban

Ummm the opening line probably says it all "go if you want to go, stay if you want to stay"I am one of life's drifters.

Q. If some one says it's okay you say

A. Cuts Like a Knife, Bryan Adams

Ummm right. The song is about resolving arguments. I guess this means I secretly turn things over in my mind, and am hurt by things more than I let on which would be true.

Q. What do you like in a girl?

A. So Hard, Dixie Chicks

The song is all about making things work in difficult situations, so I guess that means I like a girl who will work at it. Maybe. (how nuts is thisit feels like dice roll psychotherapy)

Q.

How do you feel today?

A. Out of Control, Super Furry Animals

This is quite apt. We are racing towards adopting several small children. Work is throwing me stuff I have no recent experience of. Very apt.

Q.

What is your life's purpose?

A. Run, by Snow Patrol

What can I say? I am a Piscesthat means escapism, and running away from the real world, doesn't it?

Q. What is your motto?

A. Can Ye Dance, by Donovan

Ummm yes. This one came completely out of left field. Donovan is one of the great story tellers, so perhaps that's how I should relate it. Not to be taken too seriously, but should be listened to sometimes.

Q. What do your friends think of you?

A. Corpus Christi Carol, by Jeff Buckley

Okayperhaps my friends think more of me than I thought

Q. What do you think of your friends?

A. Something Beautiful, by Robbie Williams

Sort of makes senseI think the world of those who are closest to me, even though some of them are going through a hard time. I just hope I can be there when they need me.

Q. What do you think of your parents?

A. The Cool, Cool River, by Paul Simon

Hmm perhaps this means my parents are cool? I have come to realise that we had a fantastic childhood compared to most, and have an awful lot to be thankful forand most of it was achieved without any shouting about. Very cool really.

Q.

What do your parents think of you?

A. 24 Hours, by Athelete

Hmmm doesn't really make a lot of sense. The song is about waiting for something. Perhaps my parents were waiting for me to stand on my own two feet or something? Or they are now waiting to see how I do as a Dad? Maybe

Q. What do you think about very often?

A. Mancunian Way, by Take That

The song is all about reflection of past daysand fond memories. I do reflect on the pastthe people I have known. I wonder where many of them are now, and am sometimes sad that I have lost touch with so many of them.

Q. What do you think of your best friend(s)?

A. Owl and the Pussycat, by Donovan

This is so true it's funny. I live in a dreamworld most of the time, so having this kind of view of a best friend is just perfect on many levels. The idea of running away from the stresses of this world with a close friend has been joked about. The Owl and the Pussycat indeed

Q. What do you think of the person you love?

A. While My Guitar Gently Weeps, the Beatles

I guess the song is about not being able to communicate with somebody or to do things you know you should be doing. I feel like that a lotI worry about other people too much, and of course never tell them. The person I love knows I do it too.

Q.

What is your life story?

A. Amid the Falling Snow, Enya

It opens "How I remember sleepless nights, when we would read by candlelight". The song is very calm, and reflective. I am that way.

Q. What do you want to be when you grow up?

A. The End, by The Doors

Does this mean I am going to bring armageddon upon the world? Scary thought. I could probably do it too.

Q. What do you think when you see the person you love?

A. Free Bird, by Lynyrd Skynyrd

Perfect song. She is a free bird. A hippie who missed the years she would have fitted in. A green person who worries about animals and the environment.

Q. What is your hobby/interest?

A. It's About You, by Train

Another excellent fit. My interest tends to be othershow they are, how they are doing. I always put myself last.

Q. What will they play at your funeral?

A. Hard Habit to Break, by Chicago

Oh dear. If this got played at my funeral, the whole place would fall to pieces. It's a wonderful song, and deals with loss. I just got lost listening to the first few bars. Wonderful, wonderful song.

Q. What is your biggest secret?

A. It can't come quickly enough, by Scissor Sisters

Hmm not sure how to fit this. Perhaps my biggest secret is impatience? I know several people would agree that I am growing more cynical as the years go byperhaps that has been bred by impatience?

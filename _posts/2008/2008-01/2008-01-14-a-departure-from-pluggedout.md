Following a completely unexpected change of track at PluggedOut where I have posted under the category "geekery" almost exclusively since Christmas, I have decided to return to the idea of a private blog alongside the "main one". While PluggedOut is great for posting technical geekery, and a good advert for me in my professional guise as a caped software development crusader, the more personal (and anarchic) posts don't seem to fit so well any more.

I need somewhere to write the introverted crap. The "Mr Grumpy" posts. Somewhere to write the story of the day.

So - here I am - using the hosted version of WordPress for exactly that purpose. Expect all kinds of crap to be written here in the coming days.

Over the past several days we have been carrying a video camera around with us and recording as many normal activities as possible, in preparation to make a DVD for our future children to watch.

Since being told of our existence, the kids are having to get through several weeks without actually meeting us. They have photo albums and the first DVD we did for them, but we are painfully aware that (in a child's eyes) weeks are forever. The idea of sending another DVD is to keep us alive in their mind - to keep us real.

Without the Macbook, iMovie, and iDVD, any prospect of making a DVD would have been out of the question - it has made it so much easier than we ever thought possible, with scenes cut together, voice-overs, and titles. The foster carer remarked that our original DVD was perhaps the best she had ever seen. People need to know these things are possible.

We will begin introductions with them the week after next. It's all getting a bit scary now. So many things to do. We have had to start dividing tasks into "must", "should" and "could" lists. The bedrooms are on the "must" list at the moment, and are being decorated with various posters of the alphabet and numbers. The oldest now has a bookshelf in their room filled with W's childhood favourites - the Famous Five, the Magic Faraway Tree, the Secret Garden, and many more. The wardrobes are built, the bedding is fitted, the rugs are down, and the curtains are up. A world has been built fit for little people.

Now somebody remind us - where do you buy the crash course book in "How to be a Mum and Dad" ?

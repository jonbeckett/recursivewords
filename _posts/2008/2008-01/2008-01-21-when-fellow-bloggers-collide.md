Do you ever wonder if somebody will tap you on the shoulder in the street, and whisper "I read your blog" ? I do. I can't really call it a fear as such, more a trepidation.

Apparently I have been identified in the street, but escaped the "I read your blog" moment by the thinnest of whiskers. It turns out somebody who reads my other half's knitting blog spotted me while commuting into London. She recognised the scarf I was wearing based on the recent photo of it being completed. After a little thought she decided it would have been just a little too freaky to do the "I know who you are!" conversation opener, so left me alone.

If you were wondering, it was the wonderful lady who writes "A Celebration of Mundanity", Deb Denovich.

Bizarrely enough, the story grows ever more twisted - Deb had commented on my recent post at PluggedOut about making your Blog into a book. While being nosey, I wandered over to her blog and noticed she lived near to us - which is when she admitted to the knitting/train story.

Have you ever been recognised in public as the author of your blog?

Observation of day two? Probably that it's all getting a lot easier.

This morning was filled with a visit to playgroup this morning to help the younger children say goodbye to their friends. I'm not sure they realised what was really going on, but things were made very much easier by a cheeky little lad who shouted "There's your new Mum and Dad!" when we walked in. I think somehow our appearance had been foretold.

After taking part in several songs and a few minutes of barely controlled mayhem, we found ourselves waving lots, watching tearful helpers hug the kids a little bit too tightly, and then made our way home - holding little hands along the way.

Next hurdle was lunch - which could have been fun and games, but ended up being very easy indeed. We have so much to thank the foster carer for. Any child who likes cheese sandwiches is fantastic in my book.

The afternoon brought a visit to the older child's school - with a visit to the headmistress, and a chance to meet their teacher, and class. It's starting to seem very, very strange - wherever we go, whoever we meet, we may as well be walking on a red carpet, and having people sprinkling rose petals in our path. The good will, hopes, and toothy smiles we receive along our way is incredible.

After a break where we followed a very good friend's advice to go and buy some Vic's First Defence for ourselves, we returned to visit for the rest of the afternoon - drawing pictures, watching television, and playing the game where I am a horse and they all climb on me again. We have the best photo of it, and I wish I could share it - hopefully you will understand why I cannot.

Dinner went wonderfully. Again - we have so much to thank the foster carer for. Getting the youngest to blow on hot food was a bit of a challenge, but we got there in the end. We are starting to realise that there are no huge lessons left for us to learn - but there are innumerable small ones.

The kids have accepted us totally. They look forward to our arrival each day, and are sad when we leave. A part of that is the novelty of such intense contact - but another part is that we are perhaps the most active, consistent, immovable people they have experienced in their short lives thus far.

We are starting to accept the fact that we are not what the children have known as normal. Our friends and family are not normal either - we are all exceptional. We all come from a very different world, populated with different values, different aspirations, and very different expectations of that which we take for granted from others.

This different world may be the children's biggest hill to climb, and we have no illusions about that.

Postscript - W's parents have been buying things again...

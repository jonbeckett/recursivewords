I finished work this evening, and don't go back for 2 months. During the coming weeks I have to learn how to be a Dad to several small children.

Leaving work this evening was strange - following a last hour where a seemingly endless queue of people took turns to visit my office or call me (including the MD!), I found myself stood in the kitchen at 6pm washing my coffee mugs out to take home with me.

I have never experienced so much good will from so many people. It feels very odd indeed.

The weekend is going to be spent building stair gates, putting curtain poles up, and finding ever more room in the attic for boxes of things we no longer have room for. Bedrooms, cupboards and wardrobes stand empty - ready to be populated with unknown clothes and toys.

We also need to find some way of applying brakes to W's parents - the children haven't even arrived yet, and the stream of things they "saw and thought of us" is increasing week on week. We are having to be very careful - we only have to mention we could do with something and it arrives by magic - as evidenced by the brand new pushchair in the hallway. In weeks to come I will no doubt stop feeling as guilty about receiving presents and gladly accept them.

It's perhaps the first lesson, isn't it - we are not the only people excited about the children arriving in our lives - our extended family are busy gnawing their fingernails too.

p.s. W brought home a tub of chocolate cornflake balls. I've now eaten so many of them I feel sick - and I can't stop eating them.

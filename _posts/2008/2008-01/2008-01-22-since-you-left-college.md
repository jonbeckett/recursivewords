This is my answer to a meme I thought up at lunchtime. The general idea is to state how many years it has been since you were in education, and then answer each question with a short paragraph.

17 years since last in full-time education

What have you done with those years?

Very good question. For the first three years I worked for the family business, as a combination of dogsbody, office clerk, and IT manager. My career there had a distinct air of "dead end" about it, so I was overjoyed when offered a job for a nearby small company to become their "proper" IT guy. Six years later I left there and went freelance for a while - where I lost all faith in anybody to ever do anything they said they would - and of course finally I met a girl. Meeting said girl eventually caused move of house (to her house), and getting of job (which I still have). So in 17 years I have had three different jobs, got married, lived in three different houses - one of which was the best batchelor apartment ever - and remained pretty much as big a geek as I started... although I did discover women along the way.

What do you look back on with a smile?

The people I have known. Definitely. I have worked with, and been friends with some fantastic people since leaving college. I also remember my various drunken escapades with a wry smile - like the time I woke up in the rain, wrapped around the base of the washing line pole. Our wedding was one of the best days of either of our lives - the entire day was perfect - all the old relatives stopped fighting for the day, and the weather even cooperated.

What do you look back on with sadness?

The friends I have lost through whatever reason. It took me a long time in my life to realise that sometimes the best thing you can do for somebody is not be there for them. It's tremendously difficult, and you wonder for a long time if you are "doing the right thing". Of course you move on, but it doesn't stop you wondering how they are, and what they are doing from time to time. I also miss those who are no longer with us - all of my grandparents died during the last 17 years. Childhood memories are filled with the learning of songs we should not have known, and stories of daring escapades and high adventure.

I just realised that both elements of my past - the happy and sad thoughts - are people. I've never really thought of myself as a "people person" before, but I guess I must be.

While talking to one of my colleagues earlier, I realised it has been 17 years since I left college - and nearly 20 years since I left school. I am in a state of shock.

Where did the years go? What have I done with my life? What have I acheived? What do I have to look back upon? While thinking about these subjects it struck me that it might make a very good meme - and so here it is...

The "Since You Left College" meme...

Work out how many years it has been since you left education, and state the answer. Then write a short paragraph on each of the following;

What have you done with those years?

What do you look back on with a smile?

What do you look back on with sadness?

Remember to comment back here that you did it.

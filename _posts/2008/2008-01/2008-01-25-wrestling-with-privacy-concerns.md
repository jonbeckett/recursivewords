At the moment this blog is very candid indeed - and always has been. While this isn't a problem for us at the moment, it does raise concerns for the near future, and talking about our various adventures in parenthood. In recent days I have been toying with the idea of closing this blog completely down, and starting again under the veil of a fictional persona - a pseudonym.

I know many people write under pen names, and keep their real name and/or location secret. I began thinking about doing the same thing (and have a second blog in the sidelines should we choose to take this path), but am wondering if it's really worth all the hassle. It will mean new email accounts, new Flickr accounts, new YouTube accounts, and much more besides. In a strange way it's the reverse of the line from Castaway, where Tom Hanks is told "it takes a lot of work to bring somebody back to life"... in this case it would require mountains of work to make somebody dissappear.

One of my close friends remarked yesterday that I am tremendously brave to share as much as I do on the internet. I don't see it that way - I find it far earier to just tell the truth than weave an elaborate web of half thruths. It would seem to me that as long as we use the security that already exists at sites such as WordPress, Flickr and YouTube, and are careful what we write, there shouldn't really be a problem.

What would you do, if faced with a similar situation?

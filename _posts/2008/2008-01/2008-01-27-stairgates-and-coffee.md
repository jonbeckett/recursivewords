I have spent the greater part of the day constructing stair gates for the door between the kitchen and the lounge, the base of the stairs, and the upstairs landing. Our house is slowly turning into Castle Colditz - with the intention that no childs movement between rooms will be allowed without full authorised paperwork in triplicate.

Major item of interest today - as mentioned early this morning - was a trip to Starbucks in town to meet a fellow blogger and her other half. Had a great time getting to know new people, and am slightly worried that our impending explosion into a family of ever so slightly more than two will make visiting us a somewhat brave experience should they wish to try it.

It was the first time either of us had been in a Starbucks for a long time - and certainly not in England. Nobody remarked on "how great" their coffee was, but then I am continually being chided for treating food and drink as "fuel" anyway.

After saying our goodbyes I made my way along the street to Whittard - a shop that most Americans would probably fawn over; they sell hundreds of different teas, along with all the eccentric tea pots and china tea cups and saucers you can imagine. They also sell nice coffee (as evidenced by the photo above).

Laden with coffee and the newspaper, I made my way home - arriving thirty seconds before our guests who had agreed to call in during the morning. W sat in all morning for them - missing out on Starbucks and new-friendage - so they could not turn up anyway. She could have come with me. Naturally we didn't mention it, and got on with things - as you do. We are starting to realise though that missed chances like that are going to take weeks if not months to re-schedule in the future - either that, or arrive en-masse at coffee shops in the same manner as the allied invasion of Europe.

I have now finished my chores for the day, and W is busy ironing - trying to clear the six foot backlog before we find ourselves ironing hundreds of miniature clothes belonging to little people.

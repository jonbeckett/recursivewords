Three days to go after today, and we found ourselves visiting our friends for a takeaway curry (and several bottles of wine, and to offload some of the eggs from our chickens).

We made the mistake of taking a very old menu with us from a place we had not used for many months, and after deliberating over what to order for twenty minutes discovered the restaurant no longer existed. How typical is that? We ended up ordering from the local Indian restaurant, and found ourselves collecting two HUGE bags of food from their plush reception a few minutes later.

It was fantastic - one of the best Indian meals we have had for a long time, and outstanding for a take-away. It's funny though, I can remember a standup comedian commenting once about Indian restaurants - and how everybody thinks that their local one is "the best", when in fact if you travel regularly, you realise they are all the same (it was Jack Dee, if you're wondering).

Anyway. I have work to get on with.

Tonight is the pub quiz. Three days left.

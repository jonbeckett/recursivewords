In the previous post, I invited people to ask me random questions, and promised to answer them. After spendingoh, secondspicking which ones to answer, here are my cogitations for your interest, delight, and damning verdicts

What kind of robot would you be? The kind that looks like a box with wheels or the kind that's eerily human. ALMOST TOO HUMAN.

Oh, I would definitely want to be the rusty little robot with bent antenna sticking out the top, wheels that creek, and whirry spring noises whenever I move. I would have been painted red once, but the paint would be rather chipped and corroded. I would have a telescopic single eye in one corner that doesn't always work very well.

Is cursive still necessary?

If by cursive you mean fonts that look like characters written by a nineteenth century quill pen, then certainlyof course they are still necessary. What else would you use when writing a letter to your subjects? (the snivelling spawn)

Songs most likely to stick in the head. Starting with Copa Cabana and going on down.

Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, Toot Sweets, Hushaby Mountain, Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, and of course "You Can't Touch This" by M.

C.

Hammer

Should the word "keychains" suddenly be changed to "cheekains" for no reason?

Of course it should. Friar Tuck can't play though. Neither can Betty Swollocks.

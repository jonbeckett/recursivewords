I sat opposite a young couple on the train this morning. She leaned against the window as one might if sat next to somebody invading your personal space. He leaned all over her, and just wouldn't leave her alonethat she had a nice figure, and her suit trousers fitted very well. Stop supressing snorts of laughter.

I'm not sure how rare this is, but she was not my main interest. As soon as I saw her, I wondered if something might happen - and it did. A male commuter fell into step a few yards behind her, and intently stared at her ass all the way back into the station. Well - I saw all the way back, but being my usual good natured self, I fell 50 yards behind them as others pushed in front of me at every juncture.

A similar thing happened on the underground this morning. A smart businesswoman was sat down with a very short skirt on - and doing her best to cross her legs and protect her modesty. A businessman stood over her, repeatedly glancing down the side of his newspaper to check out her legs. I'm guessing he was too ignorant to care that not only did she know he was doing it, but so did others (or at least, me...).

I often wonder about the nature of manners, confidence, and assertiveness. I stand 6'3C/3 tall. I am not skinny either - and yet when passing through a crowd I will invariably be the only person making way for others. Those of much smaller stature somehow expect me to stand aside - before I have done so. I am the one who will avert my eyes when presented with something I should perhaps not be seeing - and am aware that others do not.

Perhaps I was born into the wrong era? Who knows.

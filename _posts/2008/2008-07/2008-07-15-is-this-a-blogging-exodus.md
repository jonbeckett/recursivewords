I have been sitting up here, on my fence, watching the blogosphere for the past few months, and I can't help feeling that a change is happening. I can't figure out if the change is in me, or the world surrounding me.

Blogs (and Bloggers) I have been reading for the last several years have stopped writing - folded their blogs up and gone home. I'm not just talking about one or two either.

The voice of an ex colleague whispers into my ear that it's just me, and I'm over analysing as per normal. In reality I have been following the same little group of writers over the last couple of years, and am experiencing the inevitable shake-out that happens from time to time.

Perhaps it's time to start looking around again - to look for new blogs - new writing - new authors. Time to wield a rather large broom and sweep out the blogroll (only a fraction of which is listed in the margin).

I can't help feeling sad though - that I will no longer know those who once wrote, once shared their thoughts and experiences, and that I once thought of as friends.

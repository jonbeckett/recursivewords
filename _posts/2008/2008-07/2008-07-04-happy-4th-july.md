To all of my friends and family in the United States of America, happy 4th July - "Independence Day".

Living on the other side of the planet as I do, my knowledge of Independence Day is fairly minimal - beyond knowing that it celebrates the adoption of the Declaration of Independence, and is also a fantastic movie where Aliens attempt to invade earth, and are thwarted by Geoff Goldblum's laptop.

Apparently in 1776, John Adams declared...

The second day of July, 1776, will be the most memorable epocha in the history of America. I am apt to believe that it will be celebrated by succeeding generations as the great anniversary festival. It ought to be commemorated as the day of deliverance, by solemn acts of devotion to God Almighty. It ought to be solemnized with pomp and parade, with shows, games, sports, guns, bells, bonfires, and illuminations, from one end of this continent to the other, from this time forward forevermore.

If you are wondering why the image chosen for this post is a native American, I thought it best to support my usual stance (stood here with a big stirring stick), and praise all the European and South American settlers that arrived in North America over the last few hundred years for slowly destroying the culture, lands, beliefs and history of the native peoples who lived there first.

We've all done an excellent job so far - but not quite as good as the Spanish when they encountered the Mayans.

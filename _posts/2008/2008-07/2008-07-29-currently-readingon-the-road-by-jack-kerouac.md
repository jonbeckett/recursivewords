After hearing so much about "On The Road" over the years, I thought it was about time I read it - and while wandering around London at lunchtime I stumbled across "Books etc" on the London Wall Road near Moorgate. "On The Road" was in among their summer reads promotion.

While sat on the underground travelling home this evening I eschewed my usual podcasts for the book, and while struggling through the first few pages, was soon sucked in.

Something funny happened too. Out of the corner of my eye, it became obvious that a couple of girls sitting nearby on the underground train were taking an interest in me - apparently because of the book. I had heard this happen because of "The Alchemist", but never any other book. It would appear there are certain books that people like to see others reading.

So far I am enjoying "On The Road". My only knowledge about Kerouac before was a visit to Cannery Row while visiting the US a couple of years ago, and my father in law talking about Kerouac and the beat poets back in the day (he is a huge Dylan fan, and saw some of his early performances). Oh - we went on something of a pilgrimage to City Lights book store in San Francisco too.

The journey home flew past. It's the most I've been engrossed in a book for quite some time. I must admit that I find the story behind the writing of "On The Road" as interesting as the book itself... although the urban legend says it was written in the space of 3 weeks in a burst of frenzied work by Kerouac, it would seem the true timescale was closer to 3 years.

Of course, after reading the first 1/4 of "On The Road" I now want to find some Ginsberg to read.

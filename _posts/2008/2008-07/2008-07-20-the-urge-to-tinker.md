I have been tinkering with the "Beckett Web Design" website here and there over the weekend (check out what happens when you click on the screenshots now), and populating contacts into my HighRise account.

While researching a possible future client's website earlier this afternoon it struck me that I will need to find some kind of balance in doing this freelance work.

We still have a family of five, and the daily schedule is still as mad as ever - given the school run, my day job, commuting, and now this freelance work.

Perhaps the best plan will be to call Saturday "Kids day"...

How do you cope? Do you muddle through, or do you have a plan?

While squashed onto an underground train beneath London this morning it struck me how many unwritten rules I abide by while travelling on trains and buses; the same rules I secretly castigate others for not attempting to follow.

Among them;

Make way for women. Call me old fashioned, and eccentric if you want - but for me this applies to all sorts of things - making way for others when you meet in crowded places, when arriving at queues simultaneously, and when seats become available on buses and trains. This morning I watched several businessmen take seats when women were standing right next to them on a busy underground train. Something in me says this is wrong. Of course some women will say that I'm causing inequality.

Pregnant ladies should always get a seat. I watched this morning as a pregnant woman on the underground stood for a good part of her journey while businessmen sat all around her. It was hot on the train too. I almost spoke out, but given the animosity I would probably have met, I said nothing and now feel bad about my inaction. Letting pregnant ladies sit on trains and buses should be a given.

Don't invade others space. When travelling on public transport, or passing through crowded public areas I try to take up no more space than I am either allotted, or is necessary. On a train, I will put bags above my head (not taking the entire baggage rack), and keep everything about myself within my lap space, or between my feet. It therefore annoys the hell out of me when people kick, knee, and elbow you from adjacent or opposite seats, and/or spread their bags across nearby seats or floorspace. Their lack of consideration for others always shocks me.

Be quiet. Nobody wants to hear your personal telephone conversation in a packed train carriage - therefore don't have it. Tell the caller you will call back at a more appropriate time. Really. And don't shout down your phone either. Just because you can't hear them because of ambient noise around you doesn't mean they can't hear you.

Do NOT litter. The worst I ever saw was a fat woman eat sweets for her entire train journey, throwing all the wrappers under her seat behind her legs. Second worst was two "yummy mummies" who deposited their run-wild children several seats away with McDonalds Happy Meals while they talked shoes and handbags for a couple of hours. The aftermath looked like several garbage cans had been tipped out - and they left everything for the train staff to clean up.

I'm sure there are lots of other things I've not thought of straight away - but the above list covers the basic tenets.

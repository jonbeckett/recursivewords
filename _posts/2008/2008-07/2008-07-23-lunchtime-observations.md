I think perhaps my invisibility field was in full effect today - walking into Liverpool Street to get some lunch just about everybody and their dog walking into me, at me, or I narrowly avoided by getting out of their way.

While dodging my way back, I saw a girl with a fantastic t-shirt - "Love is a Game - Insert Coin".

I've been playing Tetris a lot recently on the DS. Last night I fought an epic battle versus the little machine on level 2 - it won 8 games to 7. This morning on the journey into London (while listening to podcasts) I fell 4-1 behind, but recovered to win 7-5.

Tetris wakes me up somehow... and it takes a few games to get going against the computer. I have given up chasing high scores in the "marathon" (traditional) version of the game... the 2 player battles are far more fun and a great 2 minute diversion.

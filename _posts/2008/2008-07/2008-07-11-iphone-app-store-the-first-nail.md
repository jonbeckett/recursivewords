Apple have finally unleashed the iPhone App Store on the world, and it's looking very much like the first nail in the coffin of every other smart phone maker out there.

The App Store provides a simple method to purchase applications from a store within the iPhone itself. A lot of the initial applications are free, and provide thick client access via APIs to the great and good of the internet - social networks, microblogging services, email... you name it. What's more, once installed they are not tucked into a ridiculous subfolder afterthought deep within the phone.

Now all I have to do is wait for my existing mobile contract to expire. My Sony Eriscsson K800i has been something of a war horse - doing most things I need, but sucking at most of them too.

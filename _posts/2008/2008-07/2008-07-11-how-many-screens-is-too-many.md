It's worth pointing out that in reality the only machines I am using are the Dell and Toshiba laptops for work. Everything else is there for the photo call because it happened to be nearby.

For those that are interested, the cast list includes a Nintendo DS, a Toshiba Satellite Pro, a Compaq Presario, an ASUS EEE PC, a Dell Inspiron, and an Apple Macbook.

You don't even want to know how many plug extensions we have in this room. Charging day is like wash day.

You're wondering why this post is titled "Headless Robots". Wonder no more - head on over to "We The Robots" and identify with the message.

I did.

In other news, I cycled into the office this morning for the first time in ages to bring my time recording up to date, and to pay back some petty cash I borrowed for one lunchtime several weeks ago. Stretching my legs on the bike was fun, and got me away from this infernal chair for a while. Don't get me wrong - it's a nice chair, and I don't actually mind sitting in here - it's a nice work environment - but I'm spending a huge portion of my life in this room at the moment.

I'm starting to sound like Woody Allen, aren't I. Must stop that now, before I start worrying out loud about the most mudane introspective subjects in the universe.

This evening is going to be filled with crap movies and crap food. We have begun this somewhat regular tradition of meeting up with some of my colleagues who live a few minutes away for pizza, beer and a movie - almost every week. I invited another colleague along tonight who lives nearby too. It's nice because everybody is within walking distance. I have to go raid the Blockbusters bargain bin later to find something for everybody to watch.

I also need to go and buy 5 pizzas from the supermarket after work - and have the psychologically damaging situation where the inevitably pretty girl on the checkout looks from the pile of pizza boxes to me, and shakes her head - and I make everything worse by blurting out "they're not all for me, honest!"

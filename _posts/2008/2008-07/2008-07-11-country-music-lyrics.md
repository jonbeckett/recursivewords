While working on some development work at home (a very boring .net web service), I have internet radio on in the background, filling the room with random music/noise.

Somehow I left it on "Kicking Country", and due to my ability to listen to pretty much anything, I have been happily bobbing away in my chair while writing classes, constructors, methods, and other such junk.

Eventually however, I began to listen. Is it just me, or is Country music written by mad people?

Some typical County music song titles...

"Do You Love As Good As You Look"

"Does Your Chewing Gum Lose Its Flavor On the Bedpost Overnight?"

"Don't Cry On My Shoulders Cause You're Rustin' My Spurs"

"Drop Kick Me, Jesus, Through The Goal Posts Of Life"

"Get Your Biscuits In The Oven And Your Buns In The Bed"

"Get Your Tongue Outta My Mouth 'Cause I'm Kissing You Goodbye"

"Guess My Eyes Were Bigger Than My Heart"

"Heaven's Just A Sin Away"

"Her Body Couldn't Keep You Off My Mind"

"Her Cheatin' Heart Made A Drunken Fool Out Of Me"

"Her Teeth Was Stained, But Her Heart Was Pure"

"Here's a Quarter Call Someone Who Cares"

"How Can A Whiskey That's 6 Years Old Whup A Man That's 33?"

"How Can I Miss You If You Won't Go Away?"

"How Can You Believe Me When I Say I Love You When You Know I've Been A Liar All My Life"

"I Been Roped and Throwed by Jesus in the Holy Ghost Corral"

"I Can't Fly My Kite No More Cause My Wife Won't Give Me Any Tail"

"I Can't Get Over You Till You Get Out From Underneath Him"

"I Can't Love Your Body if Your Heart's Not In It"

"I Changed Her Oil And She Changed My Life"

Oh dear...

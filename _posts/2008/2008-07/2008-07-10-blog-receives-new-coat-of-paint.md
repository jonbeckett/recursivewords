I thought it about time that "The Enormous Waste of Webspace" received a fresh coat of paint, so have uploaded a new banner graphic. For those who are wondering, it is a cropped copy of the original available that wonderful repository of wallpapers - Interface Lift.

I've also dropped the garish social network banners from the margin. I'm guessing nobody ever looks in the margin anyway, so there didn't seem to be much point in their existence.

That's all - I don't have a great deal to say at the moment - too busy with work stuff. I'm sure something will annoy or interest me enough soon to prompt a blog post. In the meantime, you might like to visit me at FriendFeed, or the wonderful new Identi.ca, where I have been hanging around recently.

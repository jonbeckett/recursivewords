Continuing with the line of thought that I should farm out anything that I can to external services - allowing me to concentrate on only that which is important, I ordered a set of Moo mini-cards a few days ago to assist in my freelance activities.

I've bought mini-cards before (for myself), but have never bothered with their card holders before. The design is such that you can open it, and get a card out one handed. Pretty clever stuff.

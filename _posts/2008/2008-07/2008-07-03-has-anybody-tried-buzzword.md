I discovered something rather nice recently - a web based word processor called "BuzzWord". It's based on Flash, and was bought by Adobe to help combat Google. Want to know a secret? - it's much, much nicer to use than Google Docs.

BuzzWord provides the kind of rich experience that Word Processors just don't. It has scaleable fonts, wonderful anti-aliasing, and a minimal interface to die for. The spartan feature set forces you to concentrate on the words, and the available fonts are nice. We're talking about the premium fonts that Adobe will normally force you to take out a second mortgage for.

Instead of listening to me, head on over to buzzword.acrobat.com and take a look for yourself!

While digging around in some photos on the computer this evening, I stumbled upon a folder full of scanned photographs from my childhood that we acquired last time I visited my parents. I'm guessing the above photo must be from about 1980.

It got me thinking - what happened in the world in 1980? The internwebs provided an answer;

The US beat the Soviets in perhaps the most famous ice hockey game in history at the Winter Olympics in Lake Pacid.

Robert Mugabe was elected president of Zimbabwe (if only the people had known what they know now)

Mount St. Helens erupted in May, killing 57 people and causing 3 billion dollars worth of damage

The Empire Strikes Back is released. Children all over the western world are horrified by the words "Luke, I am your father".

Ronald Reagan is nominated for President at a Republican convention in Detroit, and later is elected President of the United States of America.

Millions of people all over the world tune in to find out "Who Shot JR"

This evening W came to a complete and utter halt in "Revenant Wings" - otherwise known as "Final Fantasy 12" for the Nintendo DS. After witnessing a complete meltdown, and trying really hard to not laugh (unsuccessfully, which almost caused destruction on a hitherto unknown scale), I retrieved the DS from thence it had been flung, and switched it on.

It's worth pointing out that I had something of a mis-spent youth. I grew up with the Atari 2600, the 8 bit computers, and the dawn of console gaming as we now know it. Our children have no idea what nestles in the attic a few feet above their bedrooms - we're talking about a Commodore Amiga, a Sega Saturn, a Dreamcast, a Genesis, a SNES, a NES, a Gamecube, a Sinclair Spectrum, an X-Box, and a very rare Sony Hit-Bit MSX (new in it's box).

The MSX survived 20 years at the back of a store-room somewhere and W found it for me on E-Bay one rainy Sunday. It has so many memories wrapped up in it. I have never actually removed it from the packaging and switched it on. My first steps in programming are wrapped up in the books accompanying it, which cover "Microsoft Basic version 1.0".

Where was I?

Oh yes - I picked up Revenant Wings, which I have played for about an hour since buying a month or so ago, and cleared the troublesome level on my second attempt.

I have my uses.

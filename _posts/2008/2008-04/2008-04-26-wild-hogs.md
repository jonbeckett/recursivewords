We had our weekly movie/pizza/beer night last night with some great friends who live a few minutes walk across town. In a fit of panic after realising we had (a) nothing to drink, and (b) no movie worth dick, I headed out after the girls ate their dinner to get supplies.

I came back with Wild Hogs. The funniest movie I have seen in quite some time - and entirely undeserving of "bargain bin" status in Blockbusters.

W found it pant wettingly funny - in most part because William H Macy plays a computer geek, and she said his character was exactly what I will turn into in another 10 or 15 years. He had an Apple logo tattoo. I didn't think it was quite as funny as she did for some reason.

It was the perfect medicine in our continuing quest to find mindless yet genuinely funny movies. If you have any other suggestions, let me know.

I haven't been well for a week or so - but had so far just kept going - got on with things - carried on. This morning I woke with very little voice (but a very good Russel Crowe/Gladiator impersonation), a head filled with snot, and very little energy. Not exactly condusive to going to work and filling my head with Microsoft Office SharePoint Server architecture.

I am therefore at home, wrapped in warm clothes, huddled in the spare room. I can hear W and the children at the other end of the house in the same manner you might hear a war going on some miles away.

For the two months I was on sabbatical from work we were all perfectly healthy. I go back to work, and am greeted by an office which has (for the past month) been wracked with illness, viruses and bugs. Wonderful. All of our children are now of course ill too. Sleepless nights, tantrums, tiredness and tears seem to be the rule at the moment. We can't remember the last time we got through a day without some kind of falling down moment from the kids.

Perhaps this is normal life. Who knows.

I'm painting a bleak picture here, aren't I - and the reality is of course far from it. We have all seen Monsters Inc. - and the portrayal of the power of children's laughter. It's absolutely true. Even when pushed to the brink of a meltdown by the determined needling of an unbending child, an eventual smile or a giggle are powerful weapons indeed.

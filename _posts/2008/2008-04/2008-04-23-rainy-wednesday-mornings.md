I got up at 7am, got the kids up, got them washed, dressed, through breakfast (cereal and toast), then myself through the bathroom - shower, shave - then dressed, and back downstairs to get kitted out in full wet weather gear to cycle to work through the rain.

After changing into a spare set of (dry) clothes, I am now sat at my desk, finishing the first cup of coffee of the day, and forming plans to take over the world.

I have also figured out how to upload images directly from my phone to Flickr, so expect a world of crap photos to arrive in this blog from this point forwards. Uploading photos directly means they don't get photoshopped along the way, so expect all manner of badly composed creations to blight this blog.

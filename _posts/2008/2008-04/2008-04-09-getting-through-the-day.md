Just a short note to anybody who might read it - I am logged in to Google Talk, Yahoo Messenger, MSN Messenger (aka Windows Live Messenger), ICQ and AIM at some point every day (sometimes for hours on end).

If you would like to help me get through the day, provide a distraction, or otherwise entertain me or be entertained, feel free to shout via one of the means listed below (all of which are also listed on the Contact page).

I've found myself using Twitter a fair amount recently. I'm trying to holdback the temptation to sign up with LoudTwitter, which could automatically cross-post each day's twitters to this blog (thereby creating a new kind of hell).

n.b. if you are wondering how I manage to remain logged into everything all at once, I use pidgin or adium, depending on which OS I'm using at the time..

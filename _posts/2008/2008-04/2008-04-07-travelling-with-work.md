I'm setting my alarm for 5am tomorrow morning. I'll leave the house at 6, and with a little luck (subject to the railway and taxi gods), I'll arrive on-site sometime around 9am. Emergency hotel accommodation is being arranged just in case tomorrow goes badly.

If I do end up staying overnight, it will be the first time I have been away since the girls came to live with us, and the first time W has had to cope single handed. Of course fate has decided that two of them are ill (and therefore on a hair trigger) at the moment.

At the time of writing we are minutes before dinner, and everybody should be in "tidy up" mode - except the youngest has taken it upon herself to start playing with things. I just heard some explosive crying following a threat to send her to bed if she didn't help.

I foresee a very long phone call if I do end up sat in a hotel room tomorrow night.

The last time I stayed in a hotel with work I was armed with the Macbook - no such luxuries tomorrow. I'll be travelling light - a change of shirt and socks, a book for the journey, and maybe the Nintendo DS.

Oh great. We just discovered one of the kids had an accident earlier and has been walking around in wet tights for the last hour. Fantastic. I'm due to go away, and the wheels are falling off our wagon at home.

I somehow managed to break one of my toes last night while wandering around the house in my socks. I wasn't sure if it was broken at the time because I could still walk on it - I had however just drunk three rather large glasses of wine.

This morning the toe is impressively large, purple, and painful.

There's not much you can do with a broken toe, is there... just have to put up with it for the next few days until it starts to mend.

I broke it while in the process of tidying up after some good friends came over for a "pizza and movie" night. The general plan is that we get the girls to bed, then friends arrive, then we eat rubbish food and drink nice wine while talking all the way through a brainless movie. It works for us.

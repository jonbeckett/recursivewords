Yes, the title of this post is quite correctI have begun writing another blog. I found myself caught between a virtual rock and a hard place. While this blog has become a "day in the life" journal, with an eclectic and varied audience, it limits me in knowing that none of you are remotely interested in what I actually do all day (software and web development).

It also happens that I have begun a journey towards software enlightenment in the form of Microsoft C#, ASP.

NET, SharePoint, and MOSS WCM (Microsoft Office SharePoint Server Web Content Management). It struck me that it may be worth sharing knowledge along the way, so I acquired an appropriately named WordPress blog and set about emptying my head into it.

With my journaling efforts being divided between this blog and the new one, I am wondering what on earth I am going to do with PluggedOut. I'm seriously considering selling it.

I took the above photo with my trusty Sony Ericsson K800i this morning while waiting for a train at a quite ridiculous hour. When I left the house it was still dark, and I saw nobody on the way to the station in my home town. I was the only person on my first train of the day.

I can't really write about work, but I will say that things didn't go as planned. It has meant I am home this evening instead of sat in a travel hotel for the evening.

The one thing that kept me going today was receiving word from a friend I have not given enough time to recently. It reminded me of all that is good in the world, and lifted me enormously.

I think friends are the thing I am finding most difficult - and the change in my relationship with them. Where once I had nothing to worry or care about except myself and my friends, I now have three little people who come first, then W, then friends, then myself. I haven't even got close to finding a balance yet.

I slept for 4 hours last night - dropping into bed at about 1am, and getting up when the alarm went off at 5. Somehow I am able to just "get up" - and always have been able to. This morning's routine involved;

Having a shower and brushing teeth

Getting my clothes out of the dryer

Iron trousers and shirt

Iron a school shirt for one of our children

Make packed lunch for our eldest

Get breakfast bowls out, leaving spoons inside them

Clear washing up from night before

Find socks, shoes and tie for myself

Pack laptop bag

Find coat and scarf

Perhaps unbelievably I got through the entire list in 45 minutes - leaving me close to an hour before needing to leave to catch the train. It's amazing what things you find to do when you think you have lots of time - and how quickly the time disappears.

Once on the train this morning I nearly fell asleep more than once. I also nearly fell asleep standing up on the London Underground - first time that has ever happened. Thankfully London was bloody freezing though, which woke me back up. Wrapped in my Harry Potter scarf and duffel coat I made my way to the office.

One of my "internet friends" (as W calls them) remarked today in an instant message that it's better when you're busy because the tiredness doesn't effect you as much. Thankfully I was busy - but with business of my own making. Wanting to make progress with things or figure out how things work is the usual cause for me being up until all hours - and it gets me through the day at work too.

Fast forwarding to this evening, I am about to down tools for the day and join my better half on the sofa for a few minutes of "putting the world to rights" before collapsing into bed. Of course, once the new EEE PC arrives it will probably find it's way up with me - affording me an extra hour of surfing, reading, finding out, tinkering, and general time wastage when I should be sleeping.

If only there were more hours in the day. The world is too interesting to only have 24.

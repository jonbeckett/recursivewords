It struck me while looking at the latest version of the "Journalist" theme for WordPress that I actually like my theme (the one I hand crafted, and that you're looking at) better than any of the other minimalist themes around.

I'm now wondering of course if anybody would be interested in a copy of this theme? It's probably the most minimal I have seen. I wonder what I would call it ? "Subminimal" ?

If there is any interest, I will package it up and make it available for free download over at Beckett Web Design. Shout loud if you want it.

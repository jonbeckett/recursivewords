I have a lot of stuff going on in my life at the moment. In an effort to somehow organise and structure the various requirements placed upon me from day to day, I have been looking at a number of task list applications.

The longer I look, play, fiddle and poke around the various "popular" options, the more annoyed I become. Each and every task list solution I look at is flawed, broken or difficient in some manner. I gather from reading various blog comments and forum posts that many other people feel the same way.

The closest application I have seen to an ideal solution is "Things" on the Mac - but it is still in beta. There is an associated iPhone app too, and it looks great - but has bugs. Things partially implements the "Getting Things Done" methodology, and benefits from it enormously.

The next best thing, and the application I have ended up using for the moment is "Appigo ToDo" on the iPhone, which syncs with RememberTheMilk - the popular online task list. This would be a dream solution if it wasn't for RememberTheMilk having the worst interface in the known universe. It also wrankles slightly that you need a "Pro" account in order to sync. It's only about $25 a year, but it all adds up.

Moving away from mobile solutions, TaDaList is far too simple, and BaseCamp has no concept of due dates, or overall views. Many people use Toodledo, but I gave up on it almost instantly when faced with perhaps the most ugly interface of the lot.

Don't get me wrong - there are 1001 productivity enhancement solutions out there, but it's turning into a frustrating chore wading through them.

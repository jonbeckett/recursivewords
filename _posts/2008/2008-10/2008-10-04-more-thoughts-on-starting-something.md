You may recall a month or so ago I mentioned about "starting something" once more on the internet, and wondered if anybody else was interested in helping.

In recent days I have been re-acquainting myself with "Joomla" - the open source content management system, and a pretty good platform to build dynamic content based websites upon. I have also been listening to various podcasts - one of which had Jason Calacanis making an interesting point. The best time to start something is when the economy is in trouble - when everybody else is failing.

Throughout the time that formerly successful operations are in trouble, you run a belt and braces startup - building good will and value as you go. I think this is a very persuasive technique, and I've experienced it before - quite unintentionally, a writing website I used to run caught the imagination of the online community, and we had thousands of daily visitors before knew how to handle them.

So we now have the tools, the long term ideology, and the skills (me) to build something good. Something that will survive. A direction and a team are still missing.

Perhaps the idea needs to percolate a little longer.

Any thoughts?

Postscript... I have had the domain "thoughtcafe.net" festering away, unloved for the last couple of years. I am in the process of moving it to new servers. Who wants to write for a new internet based magazine called "ThoughtCafe" ?

I've just had one of those weekends that didn't really happen - and now find myself back at work on Monday morning, tired, and preparing to juggle complexity once again.

Friday night was spent mostly installing Joomla on the ThoughtCafe website. Lots of work ahead, but there is no huge rush - it's a long term project.

Saturday was spent taking the girls to visit their grandparents (and losing our compact camera atop a big hill in long grass). We got home late and all the kids had a total melt-down getting them into bed.

Sunday was spent at the eldest's swimming lesson, then middle child went to a birthday party with Mum while I took eldest and youngest shopping on the train. Ever done the trick where everybody else has food, and you don't? I did.

While out shopping I picked up a copy of Mario and Sonic at the Olympics for the Wii. I've only played it for half an hour so far - the first try Wend arrived home and exploded at me for not taking the kids to the park, and the second try she played against me and exploded because she couldn't do the games. I'm going to buy a hard hat to wear around the house from now on.

While watching the kids in the park yesterday, one of them managed to fall head first into the ground from the top of the slide. Thankfully the playground is made of rubber tiles - otherwise it could have been pretty serious.

And that was the weekend... or rather wasn't.

I've been trying to buy new shoes for three months now, but never had the opportunity to do so. I'm now resigned to ordering them off the internet in the pot-luck "hope they fit" lottery.

I'm tired, cranky, and fed up. No doubt by the end of the day I'll be happier, but for the moment I'm off to make a coffee and not talk to anybody if I can help it.

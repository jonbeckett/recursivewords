I mentioned the term "Ignorati" in a post a few days ago - an inspired term to describe the nutters I typically have to put up with while commuting into and out of London.

What a wonderful name for a website, I thought - possibly a forum! - "www.ignorati.com".

It has already been registered, and is being squatted on by a company who's entire business model is based around attempts to extort payment from those who want the name.

It's a difficult call. While the internet should probably remain unregulated in terms of it's content, surely some sort of regulation should exist to prevent idiotic land-grabs in the domain name system.

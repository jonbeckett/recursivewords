Okay - 24 hours into owning an ASUS EEE PC 1000H, and I have a few observations worth recording.

There is no caps lock indicator light, or visual indication on-screen.

Battery life is very good indeed - best case scenario (using a text editor, for example) would result in a lifespan of over 6 hours - so about the same as a Macbook. Running a DIVX movie through VLC at full brightness, sound, etc drops this in half instantly.

The track-pad buttons respond to pressure without actually "clicking".

VLC movie playback eats about 25% of the processor - a lot better than I had anticipated.

Wireless range is poor. Sat next to a Macbook which is reporting a very strong signal, the 1000H reports a weak signal.

There is little or no documentation on what the "Super Hybrid Engine" utility actually does - best evidence suggests that switching it on increases battery life by perhaps 30%. It may be switching off hardware semi-intelligently, and retarding processor speed.

At the end of day one, I am still very impressed with the machine. Let's see how well it deals with the commute tomorrow.

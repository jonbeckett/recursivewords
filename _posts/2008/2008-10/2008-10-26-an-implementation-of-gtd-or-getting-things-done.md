For the last several months I have been trying out various tools and techniques to help manage the various requirements placed upon me in the various roles my life consists of at the moment. While doing so I read about the "Getting Things Done" methodology, and took on board various opinions for and against it.

In the end, I have settled into a very simplified version of "GTD", and it goes as follows;

I record things I need to do (actions) in a to-do list application.

I record events I need to remember in a calendar application.

When recording actions, I associate them with...

context - this is "where I can do the task from"

folder - a folder is a "project"; something that has many tasks

due date - if there is no due date, it can be done "some time".

The big lesson so far has been in terms of using the task list effectively - it basically comes down to two behaviours;

Check the task list each day, in terms of my own context - where I am, and only worry about doing the things I can do based on that.

Review the "some time" tasks at the end of each day, and possibly promote them into "tomorrow".

That's it. That's as complex as I have made my system, and it seems to be working for me so far. It's worth mentioning the idea that you might take into account your mood on a particular day - and maybe swat a number of tasks on your "some day" list from time to time.

The secret seems to be concentrating your mind on that which you cando, based on your current situation, and only worrying about other things when your situation changes. It's liberating, and de-stresses you.

In terms of software to help me keep on top of tasks and events, I am using Toodledo on the iPhone and web, and the generic iPhone calendar allied with MobileMe. That's it - that's all I'm using. The main reason behind the choice of Toodledo is that it supports contexts. It also supports goals, although I think they are a step too far for me personally. I have no long term or even short term goals really.

Have you implemented any of the GTD methodology ? How do you work ? What works for you ?

We are days away from the start of NaNoWriMo, and I have not given any thought at all to the story I am going to write. Am I worried? Yes and No.

I'm more worried about the chances I might have to write a meaningful amount while commuting - it's pot luck whether I get enough elbow room on the train to type. Yesterday was a good example - I got leaned all over on the 2 hour journey into London, and the 2 hour journey home... which was amazing as I took up far less room than the width of my seat.

Oh - and if they guy is reading this that sat next to me on the way to London yesterday - you're an ignorant asshole. I loved how you found out you couldn't unfurl your newspaper by elbowing the passengers on either side of your (one of which was me). I also loved the fact that you spied a spare seat that you obviously didn't fit in, but wedged yourself into anyway. I bet you take spare seats while pregnant women stand too, don't you.

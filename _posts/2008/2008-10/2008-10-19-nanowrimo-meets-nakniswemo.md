No, I have not invented a new language.

Following my admission earlier today that I will be taking part in "National Novel Writing Month" during November, a good friend that knows my other half enquired if we had heard of "National Knit a Sweater Month".

She has heard of it now, and in the fashion of most lunatic knitters she is already pulling pattern books out of every nook and cranny of the house in pursuit of a pattern to suit the challenge appropriately.

While I attempt to write 50,000 words during November, my other half will be attempting 50,000 stitches. At least now I will have somebody to sit next to while churning out the words.

Our household is becoming more mad as each day passes.

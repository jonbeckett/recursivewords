It's been a while since I talked about the stuff I'm listening to while commuting back and forth from London. Regular readers will know that mainstays include the various output of Leo Laporte, Merlin Mann, Kevin Rose and Alex Albrecht. I have been listening to something different recently though, which I think I may actually prefer.

The show is called "Buzz Out Loud", and is hosted by Tom Merrit, Molly Wood and Jason Howell. Together they talk every day for half an hour or so about the latest tech news stories. They are informed, witty, and relaxed - and make a perfect listen while trying to wakeup during the commute.

Head on over to Buzz Out Loud today and have a listen - you'll like it. The show is available for download from the CNET site in MP3 format, or via the podcast directory in iTunes.

Other podcasts making their way into my consciousness at the moment are GDGT, and of course GeekBrief, hosted by Cali Lewis.

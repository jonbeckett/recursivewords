A few weeks ago a face popped up on Facebook's "people you might know" panel. Somebody I had not seen for at least 20 years, and that my main memory of is probably of sitting next to at the side of the infant playground in - ooh - perhaps 1978 ?

Somehow through school we drifted apart from those heady 5 year old days of being "bestest friends". Memory fails, life gets in the way, and you do not recall quite why or how you lost touch - why you fell in with the friends you did - why your life took the path it did.

Memory is a strange creature. It files people away - sometimes at the bottom of huge piles of rubbish - but it rarely discards people or places completely.

Such was the awakening that happened when her face appeared on Facebook...

"Bloody hell - it's you"

"Bloody hell - it's you!"

Good thing, this internet. Of course, in time honoured tradition I showed her my blog (as a lazy ass way of her catching up on my recent life), and she is now writing her own - "Box of Delights". Go read and say hello, and give encouragement - we all know what it was like when we started blogging...

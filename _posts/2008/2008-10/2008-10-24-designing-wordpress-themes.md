Several things occurred to me recently;

I am a pretty good software developer. I fall into the "natural developer" end of the double bell curve, being the sort of person that brings invention, rigour, elegance and simplicity to the creations I conjur.

I am a pretty good web developer. I write neat, compliant, easily readable HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

I am a pretty good designer. I have been told more than once that I see the world through different eyes than most people. Not many people know that I studied photography and art at college.

I know the WordPress blog platform inside out.

These observations, when combined, lead to an inevitable conclusion for many, but one that only occurred to me over the last few evenings.

Why am I not designing WordPress themes ?

It's by far the most prevalent blog script on the internet, and is here to stay. I am in a somewhat advantageous position of being able to design and build just about anything.

I am such an idiot sometimes.

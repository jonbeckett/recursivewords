While having a break and a cup of coffee, I thought it might be interesting to relate the experience of a Windows Vista machine arriving at home - what I did, the decisions I made - for the benefit of others who might tread a similar path in months to come.

Machine booted into the usual "half installed state" that Microsoft operating systems seem to these days - asking for administrative user information. Vista at least tells you that the initial user information you setup is going to be an administrator account.

The default screen resolution on boot-up was wrong. This was predictable, but it's surprising how many people have no idea that their monitor is not running at the correct resolution (and is consequently killing their eyes) - I've seen it a couple of times recently.

The monitor had the analogue cable attached to it, but the HDMI cable was in the box wrapped up. I'm wondering how many people would have tried to connect both, rather than remove the analogue one (the small D connector).

Kudos to Dell - they put a blanking plate over the motherboard graphics port on the back of the machine to encourage you to look for the HDMI connector on the graphics card.

The amount of preinstalled crap was surprisingly little. I immediately uninstalled the Dell support software, Google Desktop (hello? this is Vista? It has search built in?!), and switched off the ATI tray utility.

Next uninstall was the pre-installed McAffee virus killer. I headed off to the ESET website and bought a copy of NOD32 (widely regarded as light, fast, and reliable).

This got me a basic machine that didn't launch a ton of crap, and ran fine.

The next five or six hours were filled with copying data (the gigabytes of photos and music I referred to recently), and installing Office, Photoshop, Xara, FileZilla, Textpad, TrueCrypt, WinRAR, and the other software we tend to use often.

Finally I decomissioned our old machine - which meant taking one connected device at a time and installing the drivers on the new machine. The Logitech webcam installer fought with Vista, and appeared to fail but had actually installed. The Epson DX8400 printer driver was apparently missing from the Epson website, but mysteriously available via FTP.

I did NOT install iTunes, and I have no intention of doing so. Until Apple let iPods or iPhones sync with multiple machines, ours will be forever tethered to the Macbook.

So there you go. Taking an "out of the box" Dell desktop machine from factory-fresh to useable home computer took about 6 hours, or thereabouts. If that time had been billable, it would have cost something approaching the computer itself - and there was nothing wrong with it to start with. Try to tell that to a relative or friend the next time they want you to help them sort out their spyware ridden remnant of a computer.

In closing, it's worth pointing out that Vista is nowhere near as bad as it's reputation suggests. I have been using it at work for the last year, and it's been rock solid. As a home operating system it's an obvious attempt to copy the Mac (the existence of Microsoft Mail, Calendar, Address Book etc stand out like a sore thumb), but of course none of the third part applications integrate those functions at all (or Microsoft Office, quite hilariously).

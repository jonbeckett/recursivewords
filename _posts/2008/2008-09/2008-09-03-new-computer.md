I just ordered a replacement for our venerable desktop computer at home. I could bore you with specifications, but I am not going to. Suffice to say it's many times faster than the current machine sat in front of me, has many times more memory, many times more storage, and a humongous screen.

It will be nice just to have a computer that doesn't almost catch fire when stressed anywhere beyond "doing nothing". It will also be nice to have a computer who's guts are not hanging from it's side after repeated botched upgrades and repairs.

It will be nice to have a machine we can both login to, and leave ourselves logged in.

In short, it's going to be nice to have a computer that just works.

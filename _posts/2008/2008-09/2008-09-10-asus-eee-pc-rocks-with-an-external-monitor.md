It never occurred to me to try this before. The EEE PC has a VGA connector on the side of it. I have a spare flat screen. Lightbulb moment (with "ding" sound effect).

It works wonderfully, is fast, and supports high resolutions too (apparently the EEE PC can secretly support up to 16001200). I just need to think up a reason to use it now. Scrolling news ticker maybe? Anybody else have any ideas why a flat screen with something on it might be a good idea?

Maybe a mini LAMP server? (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP for those of you who I just lost).

You may remember I was rather enthusiastic about the "Danger Rocks" bag I bought, and that has been accompanying me to and from London on the train of late. W was also rather taken with it, which explains why I no longer have a "Danger Rocks" bag.

I have been putting off/forgetting to get a replacement for a couple of weeks. Rather than have two bags the same, I had a scout around on the internet, and ended up getting one of these...

It's a Crumpler "Boomer" bag. I chose the olive one, as illustrated above, which should arrive (with a little luck) tomorrow from Amazon. Technically, it's a laptop bag, but people use them for all manner of things - it just means it has a little padding. Given that I routinely carry my iPhone, a Nintendo DS, a Moleskine, a fountain pen, and various other bits and bobs, the padding is a good thing.

I also ordered a stack of books from Amazon while I was at it (as you do) - "A Brave New World" by Aldous Huxley, "Stranger in a Strange Land" by Robert Heinlein, and "We" by Yevgeny Yamyatin. I'll let you know what they are like as I read them - at the moment I am still trying to finish Microserfs before reading Generation X.

I've also signed up for a free month trial of "Amazon Prime" - quite what it is, or what benefit it might be is lost on me at the moment. If I find out, you'll hear it here first.

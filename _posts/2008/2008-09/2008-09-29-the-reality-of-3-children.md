While recognising that it's becoming increasingly rare for me to write about family, our children, or life in general, I thought it might be timely to make a few observations on how life has changed from January this year - when we were a couple rattling around a big empty house - to today, when we have three adopted children, a house filled to the rafters with junk, and a negative amount of "free time".

So - observations - in no particular order...

The kettle will always be empty when you go to make a coffee

There will never be any milk left for you when you want to make a hot drink

There will never be matching socks in the drawer

Work clothes will never be washed or ironed in advance

No flat surface will remain free of junk

The fridge and freezer will become festooned with magnetic letters and numbers

Every simple task will end up becoming complicated - e.g. draining pasta over the sink will require emptying the sink of washing up - which will require emptying the dishwasher in order to swap contents - which will invariably not have been switched on anyway.

Several rooms will have cork boards attached to the walls.

Every cork board in the house will have discount vouchers for various supermarkets or day-out venues pinned across it's entire surface area - several layers deep in places.

Every important piece of paperwork that arrives in the post will become lost if not dealt with immediately

Trying to use an "in-tray" is hilariously ridiculous. Within 1 day it will be 1 foot deep.

No amount of washing and/or ironing will make any difference what so ever to the amount of washing left to do

Walking barefoot around the house is liable to cause injury

Any deviation from foods eaten before by little people is a waste of time - the food will end up in the bin no matter how great it looks, smells, or tastes - this is inversely proportional to the amount of time it took to make too.

6am is a great time to be up and making lots of noise

Telling little people to be quiet works until you have walked back across the landing.

No answer of "Yeah" or "No" means anything (example - "Did you do that?" "Yeah" "Did you walk on the moon too?" "Yeah")

Apparently curling up on the floor with your face in your hands, bum in the air, is an appropriate answer to anything you don't want to do (such as go to school without your scooter, not have a chocolate bar, take wellies off before walking through the house, etc, etc).

Any concept of "free time" is laughable. Example - we bought a Nintendo Wii last week. I have played on it for one hour with our eldest daughter since. On the one evening I had a chance to play, I was too tired and went to bed early.

Getting up at 7 will not seem that early

By far the most expected or unexpected observation (depending on your perspective) is one that we realised very early on - within weeks of our children coming to live with us;

When the children are playing in a park, you will recognise their individual cry on the first cry, no matter the distance. You will know if it is fake or real. You will know where it is coming from. You will have no idea how.

If you have any further observations about "life with children", feel free to add them in comments, or write your own post.

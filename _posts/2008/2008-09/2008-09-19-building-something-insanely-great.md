I have been doing a little freelance work recently, and have been wondering about ploughing some of the money earned back into a new website. The obvious question therefore is what to build.

Once upon a time I was regarded by quite a few people around the interwebs as a "good developer". Those skills still exist of course (I use them every day in my day job); I just haven't shared them since passing on the various "PluggedOut" projects to others.

I'm thinking about something to do with communication, community, people helping each other... that kind of thing.

What sort of online community would you like to be a member of?

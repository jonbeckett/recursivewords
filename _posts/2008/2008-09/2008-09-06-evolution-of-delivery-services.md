You may recall that I bought a new computer for home the other day - who would have thought even ten years ago that the following information would be available one day for customers to keep track of;

06/09/08 05:35 BPO - SLOUGH FIRST BOX SCANNED INTO HUB.

05/09/08 20:07 WWI - HINCKLEY ORDER DISPATCHED FROM HUB.

05/09/08 18:25 WWI - HINCKLEY FIRST BOX SCANNED OUT OF HUB.

05/09/08 18:25 WWI - HINCKLEY ORDER COMPLETE IN HUB.

05/09/08 18:25 WWI - HINCKLEY FIRST BOX SCANNED INTO HUB.

05/09/08 15:21 PLAN COMMITTED NOTE.

05/09/08 13:50 WWI - HINCKLEY MERGE ITEMS PICKED.

05/09/08 12:33 IVR-OUTBOUND 08/09/08 AM DEL. SCHEDULED DELIVERY DATE.

05/09/08 12:33 IVR-OUTBOUND AM DELIVERY.

05/09/08 09:00 CALL LOCK OUT.

04/09/08 23:00 RAHEEN DEPARTED EMF.

So apparently the computer is about 20 miles away now. It was originally predicted for a delivery next Friday, but I'm guessing it could arrive today now.

If you see a photo of it on here, you'll know it arrived.

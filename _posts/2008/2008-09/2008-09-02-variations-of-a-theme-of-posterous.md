I'm sat here wondering if I might be able to find a use for Posterous. Normally I write here at "The Enormous Waste of Webspace", but Posterous is persuasive... perhaps even more so than Tumblr.

We appear to have four levels of blog platform now;

Micro Blogs (Twitter, Identica)

Mini Blogs (Posterous, Tumblr)

Hosted Blogs (WordPress, Blogger)

Independants (installed copies of WordPress, Moveable Type, etc)

The next few years are going to be interesting - considering that nobody thought "blogging" would last as long as it has. I guess if you give people a communication medium, they do what people do - communicate - find each other.

The best friendships I have were forged on the internet. They were unlikely, they happened by chance, but we found each other.

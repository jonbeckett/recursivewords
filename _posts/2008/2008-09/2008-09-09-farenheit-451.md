Amazon's website is suggesting that I should buy "Farenheit 451". They know me too well.

Ray Bradbury is one of my favourite authors - many years ago I got started on his books by reading "Golden Apples of the Sun" - a collection of short stories, one of which described the "Butterfly Effect", and indeed is where the phrase is coined from.

For those who have no idea what I'm talking about, the "Butterfly Effect" describes the basis of chaos theory - that tiny changes amplify over time and cause entirely unpredicted outcomes. In the book a time travel "experience" goes wrong when the traveller steps from the predetermined path in prehistory, and accidentally steps on a butterfly. When the party return to the present, the world is more or less the same, but strange things are very different - some letters backwards in the alphabet - that kind of thing.

Quite how the time travel company managed to build the path without effecting the future is anybody's guess, but hey - who's going to argue with a good story. Heisenberg will be spinning in his grave (yet more explanation - the "uncertainty principal" states that in observing something, you change it).

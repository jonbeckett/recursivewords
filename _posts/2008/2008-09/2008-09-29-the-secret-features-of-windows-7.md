While skimming Ars Technica earlier this evening, I read with interest their piece about Microsoft going public with Windows 7 (read: successor to Vista) at the Professional Developers Conference next month, and it's development being "secretive".

There is no secret at all to Windows 7 and/or it's feature set. It will have some more of the features OSX 10.5 has, and will come bundled with Internet Explorer 8.

Windows 7 WILL have...

A "live" file version control system (this already exists in Vista, but nobody knows it's there)

Virtual Desktops

Pop-out folders in the Start Bar and Menu

Immediate preview of common file types

So many versions that nobody has a clue which to get - and half of which will be discontinued within weeks of launch

Windows 7 will NOT have...

Any unified calendar application, or support for

Any unified contact list, or support for

The WinFS file system

Direct access to hardware by any drivers at all, under any circumstances

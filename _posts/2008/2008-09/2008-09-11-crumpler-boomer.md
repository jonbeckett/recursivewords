My new bag arrived through the post from Amazon earlier today - a Crumpler Boomer (apparently it's a "medium" - they appear to make these bags in every dimension possible), finished in Olive and Orange. It will be accompanying me on the train for the forseeable future, or on escapes to the coffee shop. Like that ever happens...

Here it is full of my crap.

And here's my crap inside it...

And if you were wondering what I actually wander around with in my bag, wonder no more - everything on the table except the iPhone which tends to live in a trouser pocket.

An inventory might be appropriate; in no particular order, Wired magazine (full of adverts, but has the odd interesting article), ASUS EEE PC, charger for EEE PC, Nintendo DS, sock for DS, games for DS, keys, rail card, Oyster card, door pass for London office, A5 Moleskine, A6 Moleskine x 2 (one blank, one lined), Parker pens (1 x rollerball, 1 x fountain), ink cartridges.

There you go. It's probably worth also pointing out that the keys include two USB flash drives, a light, and a penknife.

What do you carry ?

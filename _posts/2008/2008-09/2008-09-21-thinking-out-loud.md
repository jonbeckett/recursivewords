I have been playing with Tumblr on the internet for the last few days, and it's been liberating.

I think perhaps the secret to Tumblr is that it doesn't support comments by default. Sure, you can add them (via Disqus, for example), but the lack of feedback turns out to be important. Or at least, it's important if you see blogging in the same light that I do.

I publish on the internet to share - I am not here to draw attention to myself. I am not here necessarily to pass judgment either. I might make observations from time to time, but they are my observations and not intended with any malice.

In many ways the blogging community has changed since the early days. The masses have brought with them the "me me" mentality - "look at me - look at what I have written - look at my photos - look at my blogused to be about sharing your experiences and thoughts with an unknown audience.

In recent years many employers have begun to trace both potential and existing staff's blogs, social network accounts and blog posts. Having any kind of public voice is starting to be seen as a threat. It would appear the cyclical nature of the world is returning to the 1950s. Towing the line is becoming increasingly important. Saying the right thing. Keeping in line with expectations.

Expectations are not the sole preserve of the professional world either. The concept of "ownership of information" is becoming more important to individuals too. I have noticed a lot of blog authors relate their family disputes online. It's incredibly stupid and dangerous. Everybody from Great Aunt Maud to Cousin Billy Bob has access to the internet, and they WILL find you. Especially if they are involved... they WILL read the entire history of everything you have written too.

Perhaps the web, blogging, and social networks as we have known them are growing up - experiencing a "loss of innocence". The frontier spirit that encompassed the earliest settlers is slowly being eroded by the self important masses, who bring with them all the problems of real society and relationships.

Those of us who arrived early have an itch to scratch. We will journey on - finding new forms of communication - sharing - forming community - trying again. We will be followed eventually, and all that we have begun will be slowly destroyed. And so the story will continue.

Until I picked up the August 2008 edition of Wired Magazine while commuting home from London, I had no idea who Julia Allison was. It would appear that within the internet microcosm that is New York, with a little help from the Gawker celeb blog, Miss Allison has become quite the internet celebrity.

Most of the (admittedly few) articles I have read about her seem to be disparaging - with a transparent air of jealousy about them. It would seem Julia has figured out internet marketing in the same way that Madonna figured it out in the entertainment world - and is reaping the backlash at the moment.

She does however write an excellent blog over at Tumblr - go check it out (julia.nonsociety.com). Once you get past initial skepticism, she's actually pretty entertaining - much to the annoyance of the old media journalists no doubt.

Perhaps citizen journalism really is the future.

Following me breaking my backside for the last few weeks doing a day job and freelance work, a few of the projects have started to pay off - with money arriving into our second bank account. The idea of channeling "extra" money elsewhere is to stop it getting swallowed up paying for swimming lessons, ballet lessons, groceries, household cleaning supplies, and god knows what else.

When I walked in from work the night before last from London, and met my other half who was fighting with three uncooperative children who had been pressing her buttons all day, I fetched the second bank account card.

"Here. We split the contents of the account fifty fifty. Go spend half of it on yourself."

I went upstairs to get changed. By the time I came back down, a clothes store was on the computer monitor in the study, and several items of rather lovely clothing were already in a shopping basket. Somebody was stirring something on the cooker, and looking 1000% happier than she had been.

Money doesn't solve everything, but is sure works well as a sticking plaster sometimes. Especially when you're not earning any more, and feel guilty about spending anything out of the bank account on yourself... despite it being a joint account, and despite me repeatedly telling her not to worry.

I have no clue how much we have in the bank - I just go out to work. I tend to leave well alone, seeing as I'm married to a qualified chartered accountant.

I've not spent my half yet. I'm resisting the temptation to buy an iPod Nano. I need new work shoes, but that seems far too sensible. I also need new clothes. The XBox 360 just got dropped in price too.

Decisions, decisions. What would you spend it on?

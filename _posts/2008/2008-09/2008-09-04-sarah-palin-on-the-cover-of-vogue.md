Who would have dreamed that the words "Sarah Palin" would do better than "Britney Spears" to garner hits on the internet? Obviously Britney thinks so, because she's just announced she'll be opening the MTV awards again (car crash television strikes again).

In the meantime Sarah Palin's team of speech writers did something rather clever - they got her to say "Hockey Mom" in front of the media. She may as well have said "Soccer Mom" or "MILF"... perhaps politicians in the US aren't as stupid as we all thought... or rather, they realise exactly how stupid the populance is.

I have finally found a place for the wonderful "Posterous" service that I wrote about several days ago.

For those who have no idea, Posterous is a blogging platform that works via email - you just send an email to post@posterous.com and it creates you a blog, makes a post out of the email, and arranges attachments nicely (so, for example, if you attached a photo it will appear nicely sized in the post and open a lightbox style view when you click on it).

Here's my Posterous page...

If you have a mobile phone with a camera, and the facility to email the photos you take, you have an instant mobile blogging platform - or "moblog", as the blogging masses like to term it. I know you can do the same trick in Vox, WordPress et al, but they are all far more fiddly to set up than just sending an email.

I guess this means that "The Enormous Waste of Webspace" will remain as the main repository of my thoughts and opinions, but my corner of Posterous (jonbeckett73.posterous.com) will house the numerous photos I take as I wander the earth - purely because it takes very little effort to do so.

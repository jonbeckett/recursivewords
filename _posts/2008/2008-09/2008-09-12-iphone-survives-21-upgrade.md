Among the various scare stories abounding on the internet, I upgraded both iTunes and my iPhone this evening.

The 2.1 iteration of the iPhone operating system promised all manner of bug fixes and improvements - and so far I think they've more or less nailed it. The pregnant pause when you look at contacts has mostly gone, and syncing is greasy fast all of a sudden. Battery life is supposed to be better too - have to wait and see on that one.

The biggest surprise has been iTunes 8, and it's "Genius" feature. You can click on any of your own tracks, and it will either make a playlist based on that track (other music like it that you have), or advise you on other music you could buy that you would also like.

Finding music has become fun again.

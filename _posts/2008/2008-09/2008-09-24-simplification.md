As regular visitors will notice, I have gone back to the drastically simple look/feel that I put together a month or so ago for this blog.

There are several reasons;

It's easier to read

The typography is nicer

It's more focussed on the content

Now I just need to figure out how to integrate the Tumblog into the margin.

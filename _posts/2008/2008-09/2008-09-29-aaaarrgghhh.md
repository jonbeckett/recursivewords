If you haven't read my earlier post about the most simple tasks becoming more complicated, perhaps the last few minutes might be a good example.

It is 9pm. I suddenly remember I may have no clean trousers to wear to work in London tomorrow

Quick check upstairs - no. No clean trousers. All of my trousers have somehow found their way to the bottom of the laundry basket.

Carry 4 pairs downstairs. If I wash them now, I can put them in the dryer - they will by dry by 5am when I wake up, then I can iron them before making lunch for eldest, clearing kitchen and getting breakfast things ready before leaving for my 7am train.

Washing machine is full. Okay - need to put existing washing machine contents in dryer.

Dryer is full. Okay - need to put existing dryer contents in washing basket.

Every washing basket is full. I end up walking through the house looking for somewhere to put 50 pairs of assorted childrens knickers and socks.

Deposit washing on kitchen top in-between 2 foot stack of cake boxes and crumb laden cutting board.

Move contents of washing machine to dryer.

Put washing in washing machine.

Throw away 50 empty washing machine powder wrappers while digging for unused ones.

Turn on washing machine.

Make cup of tea before exploding.

Now I've written this I will go tidy the kitchen up, and switch the dryer on - otherwise I'll have nowhere to put my clean washing when it's finished.

On reflection, without having played the old infocom text adventures (Hitchhikers, Leather Goddesses of Phobos, Zork, etc...) I would stand no chance of completing such inane sequential tasks.

I'm guessing everybody has now seen the photos leaked onto the internet of the new iPod Nano that Apple will be announcing this afternoon.

The first I heard about it was from Kevin Rose on "This Week in Tech" a couple of weeks ago - he had been handed a couple of technical documents by a "deep throat" source within Apple showing schematics of the device.

It will be announced later today by Steve Jobs, who the press will be watching closely to see how healthy he appears to be. After his gaunt appearance for the launch of the iPhone 3G and MobileMe, Apple stock plummeted amid rumours that he had cancer. Of course Steve does all the work at Apple - they might as well fire everybody else. Sometimes analysts and commentators are ridiculously stupid - if Steve does retire due to ill health, I'm sure Apple won't hire another ex soft drink company CEO.

The conversation around my desk today is our own invented nickname for the new device - the "Fat Wide", or "Wide Fat" Nano - owing to it's obvious wide screen display that looks like it will benefit from rotation features to flip movies on their side. Expect double the storage too.

The girl sitting next to me inhaled audibly when I read the engadget story announcing that the new Nano's will come in three new colours.

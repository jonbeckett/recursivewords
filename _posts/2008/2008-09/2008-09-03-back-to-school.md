Our eldest and youngest returned respectively to school and playgroup this morning after six long weeks off. The morning schedule resumed with a bump at 6:30am when I woke 10 seconds before the iPhone alarm erupted.

I seem to be able to handle mornings - as evidenced by the 5 oclock starts when commuting into London - whereas W does less well. This morning I had got all the children up, washed, dressed, through breakfast, and packed lunches made before W showed up. We also did a photo shoot with the eldest wearing her new school uniform - up to junior school today!

This year marks the complete seperation of our children for the first time - the youngest will be at playgroup, the middle one in the infants, and the eldest in the juniors. We think it will do them all the world of good - force them to make their own friends, and perhaps most importantly - learn to lose.

The next few weeks are going to be fun.

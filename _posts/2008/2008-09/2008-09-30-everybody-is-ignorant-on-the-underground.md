Just had a typical journey on the London Underground. Thought I would share.

I jump on circle line train at Paddington - the train takes forever to leave, while the driver apologises about a technical problem. It gets 1 station further down the line (Edgeware Road) and stops, never to start again.

We all get off, and wait at Edgeware Road for the next eastbound train. A guy walks around me, steps directly in front of me, and then proceeds to check his watch every ten seconds.

Train pulls in, filled to the brim with people. The guy in front of me physically forces himself and the people in front of him onto the train. He cannot actually stay within the train without hanging on to the roof and other people.

I wait for next train - which has mercifully few people in it. This doesn't stop me being the last onto the carriage even though I was first in line.

Part empty train does not stop passenger standing behind me from pushing his backpack into me (he is completely oblivious - he's facing the other way.

At various stations people get off, meaning I can stand fairly centrally in the carriage - usually a good tactic to avoid being barged about. Mr backpack man somehow follows me (walking backwards) and continues to push into me.

We finally arrive at Liverpool Street, and I find myself near the doors. This does not stop me from being the last person to leave the carriage. Attempting to leave sooner would have involved walking into other people - just as I am avoiding them doing to me.

Walking between the train and the barriers, an old woman walks diagonally across my path. I come to a complete half to avoid kicking her. Twice.

Walking between Liverpool Street and the office, a man crosses the road in the corner of my eye, and runs to push in front of me to go through the doorway of a building I am passing.

This morning was fairly typical - doesn't say a lot for "people" in general, does it.

Unless you have been living (a) under a stone, or (b) on a desert island for the last 6 months, you will be aware that Firefox 3 has slowly churned it's way through a number of beta cycles, and was released unto the interwebs yesterday.

I downloaded it a few hours after the initial rush, and have been suitably impressed. After browsing the various thoughts and opinions of others about the new "browser of choice", I am wading in with my own listthe 5 real reasons to use Firefox 3

 1. You can use the same browser Everywhere

Firefox 3 looks and works the nearly the same on Windows, OSX, and Linux. I say nearly, because it has been tailored for each operating system to fit in.

 1. Bookmarking for Lazy Asses

The bookmark function in Firefox is now a 1 click "light the star up" affair. Perfect for lazy people like myself. Now if only they would store the bookmarks up in the cloud somewhere

 1. Speed

Firefox 3 is significantly faster than any other browser now. You don't notice it because nobody ever notices things going fasterbut you do notice the difference when you use an earlier version (or any other browser).

 1. Memory Footprint

Firefox 3 uses far less memory than previous versionsand less memory than most other browsers too. Impressively, it seems to maintain it's memory cache at a sensible level without wildly swinging between munching all of your main memory, and dumping it all back to swapfiles.

 1. It's Not Internet Explorer

Let's face it, everybody likes to dislike Microsoft apart from those displaying a sad devotion to the Redmond behemoth who argue that .

NET is the best thing since sliced bread (which, unfortunately they are right about). Unfortunately Microsoft push IE on the rest of the worlda world filled with stupid lazy people who put up with whatever they are given (clue: people like complainingtherefore Microsoft win).

 1. The Golden Tickets

Yes, this is the sixth item in the top 5. It's because it's a secret. 5 of the Firefox 3 downloads contain a PNG of a golden ticket in the installation directory. This image shows an invitation to visit the Mozilla secret factory where legions of little people work on the Firefox secret sauce.

Soall blog posts like this one end up with a summary, don't they. The summary today is as follows; Go and download Firefox 3 right now. Install it. Use it. If you don't, some horrendous curse will befall your familyperhaps something to do with flaming foxes.

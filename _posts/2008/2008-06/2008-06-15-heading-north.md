No, I am not about to head off for Superman's "Fortress of Solitude" - but in some ways you might argue that I am. At 4pm this afternoon I will leave home to head towards the north of England for a training course (for the Web Content Management features of Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007, if you are interested) - meaning I will be away from home until next Friday night.

W will be left to cope completely alone for 5 days. I feel badly enough about it - and my work in London - to begin considering my future career. We spent 2 years jumping through the various hoops of the social services system to become parents - and within months of it finally happening, and promises that I would no longer be working far from home, I am doing exactly that. We may as well be a single parent family at the moment. It's ridiculous. During a normal week, I am seeing the children for minutes between Monday evening, and Friday morning.

While sat in a hotel for the next 5 days, I'm inevitably going to be thinking about the future. Perhaps some of you who read this blog can help me pass the evenings a bit more eventfully than eating alone in the hotel, and sitting alone in a hotel bar for the entire evening. Apparently the hotel has free wi-fi, so I'll no doubt be online all night, every night.

It's 8:01am, and I'm sat in my room once more, checking email, watching breakfast television, and wondering how best to spend the next hour or so. As seems to be the way of things around here I had a shower, and wandered down for breakfast - and found the hotel mostly deserted.

Even though the hotel is so quiet, it didn't stop the internet connection being dog slow last night. Thankfully I had some DVDs with me, so watched one of them. Who knew that "Appleseed" was going to be such a good movie?

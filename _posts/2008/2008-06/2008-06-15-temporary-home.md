This is my home for the next several nights. It comes complete with a bed, a window looking out over a greenhouse full of flowers, a nice bath, a wardrobe, a television, and a tray hidden in the desk with cups and a kettle - which also has a sewing kit on it (just to add to the bizarre arrangement of the room).

Being half serious, this is a really nice hotel - and I'm glad I have somewhere nice to return to throughout the week. There is free wireless internet, and the television seems to work. There are dire warnings on the internet connection, warning you against inappropriate use - I'm guessing that might include leaving a laptop downloading movies from PirateBay all day... must remember that.

The journey from home took longer than expected, but was pretty uneventful. The only real problem came when I walked out of Euston underground station, and the only sign pointing towards the overground station said "Euston Station - 400 yards", with no further clue after that. If not for Google Maps on my mobile phone, I could easily have got lost. It's worth pointing out if you didn't know - Google Maps uses the mobile phone network to work out where you are - kind of a poor man's GPS. Of course if I had a modern mobile phone, this wouldn't be an issue.

To help pass the time in the hotel I'm reading "Microserfs", by Douglas Coupland. He's the guy who wrote "Generation X" (which coined the term). So far it's quite entertaining - and falls within my realm of experience of the IT industry. It's set in 1993, which means Windows NT, Windows 3.0, and Microsoft Office becoming a force to be reckoned with. I remember implementing all of them.

If anybody wants to catch up with me in the evenings, I'll be on all the IM systems listed in the contact page every night. Help me interwebs... you're my only hope.

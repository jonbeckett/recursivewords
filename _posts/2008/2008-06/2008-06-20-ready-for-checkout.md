It's Friday morning, my bags are packed, and I'm ready to get out of here. Just the small matter of the rest of the day sat in a classroom before heading home.

The journey will take me back into London (about an hour), then a trudge through the streets to Paddington (another half an hour), followed by my usual journey home. I must remember to buy a train ticket at Paddington - my season ticket has now run out.

With a little luck, I'll arrive home before it gets too late in the evening, and get a chance to catch up with W before the morning when the kids will no doubt launch themselves at me (I'm looking forward to seeing W and the kids again rather a lot).

Wend has done fantastically this week - coping completely alone with everything. I know lots of other people do it, but they probably got used to it over years - they didn't suddently go from no children to three. I wonder if I can get her a medal or something from somewhere?

I received a photo in my email last night - our eldest now has no front teeth, and is about the proudest little girl I've ever seen - she knows she's growing up.

How many screens on a desktop would you consider too many?

The computer at left is for the client contract I am working on - most of the day will be spent staring at it.

The big screen is connected to a Dell Precision multi core monster with gigabytes of memory. This usually gets used for Microsoft SharePoint development.

The widescreen Dell laptop in the far corner is my normal work laptop - just about big enough to take SharePoint development on the road with me, and requiring a "King of the Rocketmen" style backpack to carry it.

The diddy machine in the foreground is an ASUS EEE PC. I carry it everywhere now - it provides my personal email and web access (should I need it).

Right at the front of the desk, next to the Moleskine, is a Palm 3. This provides the unique feature of letting me listen to podcasts and write down notes at the same time, on the same device. Handy when podcasts like "Net @ Night" are shouting out interesting sites to visit.

Propped against the big monitor is my trusty old Sony Ericsson K800i phone - which can connect to the internet and serve as a bluetooth modem. Paired with the Palm or the EEE, it works remarkably well.

I seem to have become "the connected man", don't I...

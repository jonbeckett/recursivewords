I can't sleep, and I've realised why. I miss my family... a lot.

I'm stuck here, in a hotel, a long way from home, and the wheels are slowly coming off the wagon at home - the cause is almost certainly a combination of me being sent to work in London, and being sent away to this residential course. I missed half of father's day (my first) to travel to this place, and have now missed the first visit to one of the children's school.

Our girls were just starting to get some confidence - to know myself and W as constants in their young lives - and given my current work situation they may as well not have a Dad at the moment.

It's not fair on them, it's not fair on W, and I'm not happy.

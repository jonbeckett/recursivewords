I finally have a copy of Star Wars for the Nintendo DS - complete with swishy light sabre noises, and tinny but thunderous music.

I will of course have to resist the urge to hum along to the music while squashed among fellow commuters on my way into London tomorrow - or shout "Luke, I am your father!" at an inopportune moment.

W's Uncle Peter got married on Saturday to a wonderful lady called Janet. The horrendous weather miraculously stayed clear throughout the day, and provided our girls their first opportunity to meet more of W's family. We realised during the day just how well behaved our girls are - and while it's not an accident (we have to moderate everything we do and say to encourage it), it makes days out very much easier than they might be otherwise. There appears to be a huge difference in the behaviour of little boys and girls too - that we had not seen illustrated so starkly before. The boys seemed so much more independent, spirited and mischeivous than the girls.

The only slight slip-up of the day occurred when a waitress dropped a drink - and the most fragile of our children was stood directly under it. She got covered in wine, and glass exploded around her feet. In true Dad style, I arrived at the sound of the first scream over the shoulders of the waitress and our little one experienced vertical liftoff. I got soaked to the skin too while hugging her, but all was well a few minutes later. Thankfully W had a supply of emergency clothes at the ready.

Today is filled with a week's worth of washing, tidying up, buying of groceries, and other mundane activities before returning to work tomorrow. I'm hoping to find time to sit down and watch the Formula One and the Moto GP races later.

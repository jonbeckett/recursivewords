Without a shadow of a doubt, I think it's going to be the movie of the summer. Something about it reminds me of Grease. I just wonder if the movie studio know what they have on their hands? Millions of kids are going to queue up to see this... along with millions of parents who sheepishly claim they are taking them but will laugh, cry and cheer more than their children.

I just saw a clip of it on Breakfast television not available on YouTube - of Meryl Streep singing "The Winner Takes it All" to Pierce Brosnan, and the hair stood up on the back of my neck.

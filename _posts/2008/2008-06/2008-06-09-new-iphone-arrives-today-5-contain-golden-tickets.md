Apple will finally release the new iPhone later today - so I thought it might be fun to make a list of the rumours and speculated features that are buzzing around the internet. Later this evening we can go back through the list and find out what was accurate, and what was not.

To begin with, here's the most important rumour...

The new iPhone will contain a golden ticket in 5 boxes world wide, which will invite the finders of the golden ticket to visit Apple, and be taken on a tour by Steve Jobs himself. The ticket holders will get to meet the secret tribe of little people who invent and build Apple's products, and it is also rumoured that the successor to Jobs will be chosen from the ticket holders.

Here's the rest of the (far less important) rumours...

The new iPhone will have 3G capabilities. (true)

The new iPhone will have GPS built in. (true)

The new iPhone will have a larger screen than the previous model. (false)

The new iPhone will be thicker than the first version (false)

The new iPhone will be thinner than the first version (100% true)

The new iPhone will have a better camera than previously (true)

The new iPhone will have a second camera behind the display for video chat (false)

The new iPhone will have significantly more storage than the current model (true)

The new iPhone will have an open set of APIs and SDK, allowing software to be developed natively for it. (true)

Apple will allow mobile network operators to subsidise the price of the iPhone. (no announcement yet - although the phone is a LOT cheaper)

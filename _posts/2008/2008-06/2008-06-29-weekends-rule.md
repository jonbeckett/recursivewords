We are approaching the end of a long weekend (I had Friday off), and yet I don't really recall much about it - although I know it was packed with activities.

Much of Friday was spent in the park with the children - waiting for the school "Noah's Ark" display that never happened during the rain. Half an hour before we called the school and were informed it was still happening - we left the house, got pelted on by a storm cloud on the way to the park, and arrived to find very few groups of parents in the park waiting for it all to happen.

Why bother with a phone line to the school that doesn't give out the right information? It also took about 50 tries to get an answer - with well over 100 families trying to call it in the half hour we did. A web page would have worked far better, but then I would probably get dragged into maintaining it - something I have no time to do at the moment or for the forseeable future.

Saturday was filled with a visit from W's brother, various hijinks involving the paddling pool in the back garden, and a rare trip out in the evening for me to the local pub. After eating takeaway when we got home, I collapsed onto the sofa and woke at midnight with W and her brother both laughing and asking if I should maybe go to bed...

Today (Sunday) has been a very quiet day on purpose. We all needed it. Wend has been busy chopping down nettles at the far end of the garden, and I've been involved in a number of ball games. I figure it's best to get the kids outside while the weather is good.

Sunday has nearly gone now, and there is a creeping dread of the return to work tomorrow. Roll on next weekend.

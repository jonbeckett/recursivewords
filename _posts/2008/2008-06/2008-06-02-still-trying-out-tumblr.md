I'm still trying Tumblr out - it's an alternative blogging platform to WordPress, and when allied with the Disqus commenting platform it seems to work very well indeed.

Latest post - "Back at Work".

It's probably worth pointing out that Tumblr let you monkey with your templates and CSS as much as you like. For free. Unlike WordPress.

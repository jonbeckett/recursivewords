Yesterday was a nightmare, and today isn't looking any better so far.

Without going into too much detail, one of the kids had a tantrum and wet herself on purpose, and two of them were sent to bed at various points during the day. It feels like we are continually either telling them off, or sorting out arguments - perhaps it's an inevitable side effect of all being shut in the house for a few days.

Last night I found out that a badly worded blog post I wrote two years ago had hurt many feelings in my extended family - I have of course apologised to all involved, but I'm guessing the damage has already been done. It was a classic post where the words could be interpreted in many different ways - and everybody read it differently than each other.

Just to cap things off, I stood on the cat this morning by accident - and W has had to rush him to the vet. We thought he was fine, but then realised he is limping.

I wonder what I can do wrong next ?

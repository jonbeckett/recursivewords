I woke suddenly to the sound of crying this morning, and ran into the bathroom - hastily tying my robe on the way.

I discovered the middle child with her PJs around her ankles in tears... cue 6:50am running of the bath, and both of us up and out of bed.

It's now 2pm in the afternoon and we are already shattered. The same kid just threw the mother of all tantrums on the swing in the back garden - while screaming "I can't do it!" she kicked her feet, and convulsed her entire body like a lunatic... it was all I could do not to laugh out loud.

Ten minutes later she was making the swing work on her own. Coordination doesn't seem to be any of their strong suits - or confidence. That's what comes of spending their formative months strapped into strollers rather than doing anything interactive.

I am continually amazed at all of their progress though - the eldest learned how to use a scooter immediately. The middle one has learned to swing in two days. The youngest is learning brand new words every day... and she has a sense of humour too.

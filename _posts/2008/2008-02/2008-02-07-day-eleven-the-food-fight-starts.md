Okay - we finally have something to think about.

The middle one - just turned four - has started saying "I don't like it" when presented with food she ate quite happily the day before. She's got the body type most prone to putting weight on very quickly indeed, and of course suddenly has room for pudding as soon as the plates have been cleared away. While we know very well this is a phase, and will pass, she is also the most easily tipped into a tantrum.

We're wondering if the testing of boundaries and fragility is her way of testing us - do we love her? will we always be there? why has her home changed?

Yes, we will be withdrawing puddings for a while, but we will also make more effort to make meals interesting - to make healthy foods fun. And perhaps be a little more strict along the way.

I wonder how deep we should dig the trenches?

In happier news, she fell asleep while being read "The Tale of Tom Kitten" earlier this evening. The eldest conked out to "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory", which I enjoyed reading as much as she did listening.

Memorable moment today was the middle one's reaction to seeing new posters on the bedroom wall of the Disney princesses. The wide eyed whispered "Wow!" would have powered Monsters Incorporated for a year.

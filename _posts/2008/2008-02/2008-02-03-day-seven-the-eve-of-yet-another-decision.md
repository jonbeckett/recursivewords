I am finding it difficult to find subjects to write about - not because I am shielding any great confidences, but because normality seems to have descended today. We only had the children for half the day due to their foster carer having a "goodbye" session at her house this afternoon - the children's friends were all invited over to bid farewell.

The "goodbye" day of course prepends tomorrow's meeting with the massed ranks of social services, who are gathering once more to make a judgement on our progress. If the result is positive, we bring the children home on Tuesday morning... and the line across our calendar marked "life as we know it changes" comes into play.

Wish us luck.

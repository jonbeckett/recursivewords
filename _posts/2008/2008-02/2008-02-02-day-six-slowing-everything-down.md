After perhaps the most difficult day yesterday we were determined to take a step back today and slow everything down.

We realised we had been trying far too hard - providing the children with an endless stream of activities rather than letting them find their own. It drained both us and the children, and provided just the right recipe for tiredness, tantrums and tears.

We have slowly been setting rules - trying desperately to make them simple, and not go back on them. Today's new rule was that the younger ones are not allowed into the older one's room while they are not there. We had already set out that they needed to ask, but tightened it a bit further after discovering one of them with an open monopoly box and paper money across the entire room... you have to learn this kind of thing don't you.

Childrens television was left on in the lounge - although not watched because we encouraged the children to find places for their own things in their rooms. This task obviously took a lot of thinking about and much putting on and taking off of shelves (we suspect the setting out of things on shelves was a tremendous game - hopefully we can think up ways of making more odious tasks seem fun).

Nightmare of the day came when I switched the television back on after lunch and discovered the viewing card had gone missing from the satellite television receiver. I stopped all the children in their tracks, and began the speech about the television never working again unless we all looked for it (it was obvious the youngest was the perpetrator due to the heartbroken looks on the older children's faces). We all set about looking for the missing card - under toys, behind furniture, and then inspiration struck. The drawer with the television remotes in.

The television remotes now live out of reach, and the viewing card is about to be taped into the machine. Stop laughing.

We are learning all the little things very fast indeed. Every hour of the day brings a new lesson, a new behaviour, and a new aspect of the children we have not seen before. They are bonding with us too - and performing an odd reversal of our expectations of their character.

Suddenly we feel strangely aware that the social services staff who have cared for the children's needs over the last year or so are feeling left out. "Their children" are fast becoming "ours" - it's obvious from their natural way around us, their relaxed chattiness at mealtimes, and their attempts to impress with their antics.

Funniest moment of the day was perhaps the middle one dancing like a lunatic to some music that came on the radio - of course we cheered, which caused ever more lunacy, followed eventually by very old fashioned hands-on-hips huffing, puffing and wiping of forehead with wide eyes - telling us "I'm puffed out now!"

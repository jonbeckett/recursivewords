It is 9:35am. I have already been up for nearly 4 hours. That's all I want to say about that.

I do mornings much, much better than W - I always have, and probably always will. As soon as my eyes open I have no problem getting straight up, having a shower, and immediately getting on with things. By contrast, W can take several hours and several cups of tea before she is really "up to speed".

Anyway - how are things going? Much better than we should expect.

Yesterday was filled with a visit to Welford Park to look at the snowdrops - we all dressed like eskimos but were still bitterly cold. It was a great day out though, and gave W's Mum and Dad another chance to spend time with the kids and bond with them a bit more. I feel sorry for my own parents now - they live a long way away, so visits to see them or for them to come up to us are going to be few and far between. They live on the coast though, so perhaps that will provide a quick win in terms of bonding - the children will inevitably see visiting them as "going on holiday to the seaside".

This morning we are going to the garden centre to buy some seeds. Growing tomato plants and such like should be a fun activity to do - and give the girls another job to do each day (we are giving each of them specific tasks to do each day rather than them fighting over what they do).

This afternoon is going to see the kitchen floor covered with newspaper to paint some pictures. No doubt the paint will go everywhere, but it should be fun.

Hopefully you are having a much quieter day than ours...

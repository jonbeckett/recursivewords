No apologies for the 1970s advert from YouTube above. Our younger kids have been given a play kitchen by our friends, and have spent all afternoon engrossed in pretend cooking and poisoning adventures.

Today is the first time they have really played on their own without being led by us.

The eldest is at school. She had her first day back yesterday, at her new school, so today is her second day. When W and I arrived in the playground this morning to drop her off, one of the other mums instantly asked if we were the new girl's Mum and Dad. It feels like joining some kind of weird masonic secret society populated by parents.

I can't want until I am dragged into the inevitable social status fishing that seems to go on among the parents. I've said it before, and I've said it again - I can't stand snobbishness - and yet I find myself living in Marlow. Go figure.

Many moons ago I had an account at Vox - I was one of the beta testers when it was being developed too.

I thought it might be fun to try it for a while again - see if it has changed at all. If you would like to accompany me, my profile over there is at the following URL...

One of the things I really like about Vox is the "library" - where you can easily tag books, movies, music and so on that you like. It also has aspects of social networking - and while not as blatant as Facebook, you might say Vox is "Facebook for bloggers" - and without the idiotic "applications" that now blight Facebook.

Who knows - perhaps in the long run Vox may actually gain ground against Facebook. I've been wrong before, and I fully expect to be wrong again... it would be nice to see something that's built and implemented well take a few lumps out of Facebook and MySpace though.

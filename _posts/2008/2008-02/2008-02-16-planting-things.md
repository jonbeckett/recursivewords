This morning was occupied with the children's first experience of planting things. We are all growing Sun Flowers in a competition of sorts to see who does the best. For the best part of two hours our kitchen was turned into a potting shed.

We also planted tomatoes, beans, and cucumbers - trying to impress on a 7 year old that one tomato seed was enough was rather difficult - especially when she blew on them, and half of the packet disappeared...

The day went really well - right up to the point where the middle child discovered her older sister being measured up by Mum for a dress...

"What that?"

"The school is doing a project on the Victorians, and on one of the days the children will dress up as Victorians"

"Can I go!"

"No - you don't go to school yet, do you"

Cue an hour or more of really determined misery guts impersonations - so much so that she fell asleep face down on the couch. The whole thing had been kicked off much earlier in the day when she couldn't figure out how to bounce on the space hoppers in the back garden. I won her back later in the afternoon with her first go on a computer ever. I have downloaded the latest Knoppix DVD for the old laptop we have hanging around - and there is a suite of educational software on there called GCompris. It's brilliant - and more importantly made her feel special being the only one to do the activity we were doing.

The youngest had the funniest explosion of anger on the space hoppers - after repeatedly trying to climb on, she ended her comedy act by going face first over the top of the space hopper, and landing on her bum on the far side. She thumped both her legs as she sat in the mud, and then started the air raid siren up.

After a few moments I distracted her with the chickens and the cat.

So all in all, a pretty normal day.

p.s. Would also just like to thank Deeg who made us some fantastic food that we are still eating this evening - everybody has loved it....

Today started at 7am with the sounds of laughter and little people shouting instructions to each other across the landing. I got up and made my way down for a shower before releasing them all from prison (we have a stair gate on the top landing).

Today was a big day - meeting their new Nan and Grandad (W's parents), and their Uncle Neil. Organising these first few meetings with people has been like a military operation. Just to make things worse for ourselves (and tempt fate) we also took the whole gang to a pub for Sunday lunch.

I am very, very relieved to say it went better than we could ever have dreamed. At dinner tonight we asked the kids what they thought of their new Nan and Grandad, and Uncle Neil. A quiet "brilliant", and smiles all round. It might have had something to do with the teddy bears, clothes, and toys they also got, but mostly I think it was just having kind, supportive people around them (and a Grandad who talks rubbish just like he should).

It is tempting to forget their past, but we cannot and should not. Most of the various behaviours they are exhibiting is rooted in their past. We have seen jealousy, anger, frustration, and a total lack of confidence or spirit at times. Hard things are "impossible", and effort is something they do not know - how could they? - they have never seen anybody try hard at anything.

Cutest moment of the day was perhaps the middle child saying "Thankyou Uncle Neil for my Teddy" at the end of the day. It still amuses me now - picturing him in the queue of some shop with three enormous teddy bears tucked under his arm. I think everybody melted when she piped up with it though...

p.s. we have a Star Wars fan on our hands

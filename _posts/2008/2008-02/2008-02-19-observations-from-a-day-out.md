We took the children to the farm again today - to see (and feed) the animals, and to play on the adventure playground. We didn't really give much thought to it being a school holiday this week.

Some things I noticed or remembered along the way...

One mother (wearing a full length tweed coat, real fur hat, and knee length leather boots - to go to a farm - screamed at her child (who was already inconsolable) "Are you going to start behaving, or am I going back to work?". Yes - I wanted to take the mother aside and have a go at her...

People with strollers and/or pushchairs have the capacity to be insanely annoying. I have a feeling there is a connection between the Gucci wielding mothers with their Titanic sized strollers, and the massed ranks of 44 leviathans clogging up the car park (one of which nearly ran us over after ignoring the man directing people to parking places).

A little boy (about 4 years old) broke down in tears because his Mum wouldn't wipe a few grains of sand from his hands after playing in the sandpit...

Myself nor our youngest saw any of the lambs being fed, because an entire barn full of pushy parents fought with each other and charged the fence when the lambs came out. Our little one started crying so I sat and cuddled her - telling her how unthinking most of the people in the world must be. It happened again when they fed a cow later in the day.

On numerous occasions during the day I got split up from Mum and the others while carrying the youngest - chiefly because people barged in front of me - not just one or two - tens of people... many times.

I think it's fair to say I have had my fill of school holiday wealthy parents out en-masse with the children they normally dump on nannies. Both myself and W quietly made our way through the crowds with our three, shaking our heads at the threats, shouting and general mayhem.

You can't help but wonder if you only notice the idiots - and the normal parents such as us go undetected just as we do, as we slip through each day causing as little fuss as possible. Surely there can't be THAT many idiots in the world?

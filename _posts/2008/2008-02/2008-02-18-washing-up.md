Today I have been mostly washing up. Usually I switch off while washing things up, but this evening while drying the fourth sink full in a row, I became aware that all I did between eating dinner and bedtime was wash up dishes and pots.

There is a reason too.

W doesn't eat meat. The eldest is gluten intolerant. Tonight was a "worst case scenario" in terms of food - two kinds of pasta being cooked, and two kinds of sauce / filling being cooked (we had bolognese). Add to that 5 glasses, 5 plates, 5 pudding bowls, and 5 sets of cutlery and you start to see what can pile up.

I should point out that the 4 sink fulls of washing up was in addition to an entire dishwasher full after a cake making adventure earlier in the day - the girls made cakes with mum, topped with as many chocolate bits and bobs as would stick in bright pink icing on top of fairy cakes...

I am now off to empty the dishwasher so I don't have to face it in the morning.

I'm currently waiting for a virtual server to finish processing something intensely complicated. While doing so I cannot fiddle with any other code, so am reduced to twiddling my thumbs. I am reminded of a Dilbert cartoon from many moons ago when the Boss caught Dilbert staring into space and asked what he was doing "waiting for my program to compile", "well grimace or something then" (which he of course does).

So... I have been thinking about this blog. All blogs really. Wondering what is important. We fill the margins with so much utter crap - and nobody ever takes ANY notice of it.

Therefore this evening I may well do a bit of a re-design. A simplification. Get rid of the crap. Loose everything but the bare essentials.

Any thoughts? Ideas? Anybody want to join me in doing it to their blog too ?

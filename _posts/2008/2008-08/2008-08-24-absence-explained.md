If you have been wondering about my absence from the internet at large, wonder no longer. Last week we were on holiday at my parents in Cornwall, and this week our entire household has been struck by bad colds. I have been the last person to catch it, and am busy coping with huge temperatures as I type this.

The kids are all out in the garden, running around in skirts and t-shirts. I am sat inside, wrapped up in thick socks and a pullover, camped out in the living room.

Meanwhile the world is carrying on around me, and I'm being bitched at from all directions for not being there - not having done things - not being "as expected". Half of it is my own fault - I thought "nobody needs to know I'm ill or busy - it's not going to be of interest to them". I've found myself thinking like this a lot recently.

I am up at 7 each morning usually, feeding and clothing three children, putting a roof over our family of five's head each day - doing a full time job, and freelance work too from time to time. Along with my better half who takes most of the strain within the house, we do our best. We don't play the victim - we deal with life's hurdles without complaint.

It's hard sometimes - reading blogs left right and centre that complain and whine about the lot life is throwing at their authors. Never a thought seems to be given to doing anything constructive - far better to write huge self absorbed essays.

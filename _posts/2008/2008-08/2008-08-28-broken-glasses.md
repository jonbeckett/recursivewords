This morning our youngest snapped the eldest's glasses in two. This caused an inevitable derailing of the entire day that had been planned for the children.

I found the youngest ignoring all calls for her name, fingers in her mouth, daydreaming in the lounge. She has this pose where she tips her toes to the ground, and waggles her heel back and forth. I grabbed her by the arm and marched her into the kitchen.

(pointing at glasses) "DID YOU DO THAT?"

No response.

"DID YOU BREAK [insert eldest's name] GLASSES ?"

No response.

"SHE CAN'T SEE NOW - AND NONE OF YOU CAN GO OUT TODAY NOW EITHER"

Cue waterworks.

Of course they are still going out, but not without an emergency trip to the opticians. Also their Gran, who took the day off work is now finding out that she may as well not have - because by the time they reach their house to set off on the planned day of fun, it's going to be more like an hour or two of fun.

Here's the dilemma...

Who do you tell off - the eldest for leaving her glasses where the youngest could get them, or the youngest for mangling her sister's glasses ?

The problem with being the predictable, dependable person that everybody knows, that everybody expects to remain the same, and that everybody expects a smile and help from is that the dependable person doesn't always feel the way he looks.

Sometimes he feels detached, and actually quite lonely.

You float like a quiet ship through people's lives - sometimes doing good, sometimes doing harm - and little traces of you are left here and there. Others take a little here, a little there. They go on with their lives, and you meander off towards others.

Sometimes you hit a calm stretch though, and look back over your shoulder - wondering if you are doing the right thing - passing through and never stopping. Wondering what if.

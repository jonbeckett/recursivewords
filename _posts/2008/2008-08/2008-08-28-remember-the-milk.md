In a battle to somehow simplify and also organise my chaotic life somewhat, I have been trying out a task list thingy on the internet called "Remember the Milk". Lots of people swear by it (or at it), so in the grand tradition of trying everything and it's dog out (which sounds perverted), I am doing so.

The real bonus for "RTM" as it's officianados call it, is that there's a todo list app on the iphone that will sync with it. Meaning I can carry my tasks around in my pocket.

By now you're wondering why I don't just use a notepad like every other bugger out there. Simple. I would forget to look in it. "Remember the Milk" will hassle the crap out of me when something is due - texting me, texting me again, going "ding", and so on, until I do what I told myself I would. It will even tell me how many times I have postponed something.

The only other feature RTM has that I'm bothering with is the ability to create new tasks by email. It's clever enough to figure out dates from scribbled notes in the email like "due: next tuesday". Perfect.

Of course none of this task list stuff will really help me become more organised at all. I will just be more aware of what I have not done - and therefore more stressed than I would have been otherwise.

I'm sure those of you who spend far too many hours on the internet will have looked at Plurk already. For those of you who have not, here's what it looks like;

Plurk is an interesting take on the micro-blogging phenomenon that seems to be sweeping the world. Armed with only 140 characters, you can blurt out anything you like, and the world at large (or rather, the other plurkers) can see what you are blabbering on about. Watching it's timeline scroll past is perhaps the ultimate "slice of life" voyeuristic experience to be had on the internet.

Of course you are only going to read that which others are sharing, but strangely it's the inane commentary on personal lives that turns out to be the most interesting. What's more, Plurk makes it very easy to hold a threaded conversation off the back of yours and your friends random utterances. It has somehow garnered a very friendly, inclusive and supportive atmosphere among it's users too.

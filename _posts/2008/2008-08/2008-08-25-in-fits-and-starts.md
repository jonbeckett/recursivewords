Does the phrase "in fits and starts" exist outside of great britain? It describes the manner in which things happen sometimes at a trickle, and sometimes in abundance. At the moment this blog is "at a trickle".

It's not so much that I have nothing to write about - more that I have been balancing that which I think the world would find interesting, and found it not so.

Do you ever face these bouts of apparent apathy? When you do not write because you judge what you have to say uninteresting? Perhaps the uninteresting happenings are the most interesting to others - it would certainly explain microblogging (Twitter, Identica, Pownce, et al).

Perhaps if I spirited myself away to a coffee shop once a week the words might pour forth in more abundance?

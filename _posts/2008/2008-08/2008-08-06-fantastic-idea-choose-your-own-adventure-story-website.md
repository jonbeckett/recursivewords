While sitting down eating dinner at a chinese restaurant a couple of years ago with friends, everybody was trying to talk me into making a web based version of the old "Choose Your Own Adventure" story books.

The only thing that has prevented it has been time. Just imagine how fantastic it could be...

At the end of each page, visitors choose the continuation from a list of actions ("run away","throw teacup at dragon", etc)

Readers get to star rate each page (to build a preferred route)

Preferred lines of story could be output as one long tome

Anybody could fork a story in any direction

I think it would work wonderfully, and I don't think it would be hard to build either.

Who wants to help me?

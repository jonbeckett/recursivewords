I took the elder two kids to see "Kung Fu Panda" this morning at the cinema. For our 4 year old, it was her first ever visit. Never has such a big grin been seen for so long plastered all over her face.

I have to give Odeon cinema's their credit - the kids "happy meal" for the movie was a strong paper bag containing sweet popcorn, a bag of cadbury chocolate stars, the "Kung Fu Panda" childrens book, and a soft drink (with, most importantly, a bendy straw).

The kids laughed like drains throughout the movie - thanks go to Jack Black and Dreamworks for that I suppose. It's a shame the movie website has no colouring pictures to print out, because they're both asking for them.

Our youngest spent the morning having quality time with her Mum, which in reality meant going to the supermarket to buy new slippers for everybody, and making a guitar out of a shoebox.

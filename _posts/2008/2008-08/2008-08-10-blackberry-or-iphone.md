My mobile phone contract comes up for renewal in a couple of months time - and I'm already looking at the various options open to me. The following devices are at the top of the list;

Blackberry Bold

iPhone 3G

My main criteria are...

Unlimited internet access

Great built-in browser

Great built-in IMAP email client

Good integration with online services

A half decent camera

A good media player

I am not so interested in integration with traditional thick client (think:installed) desktop applications. While I have been freelancing and working remotely over the last year or so, it has become apparent just how useful services such as webmail, online CRM, online project management, online file storage, and online office suites really are. If I can use any device with a good browser to access my regular suite of productivity applications, I will be happy.

What applications am I talking about? In no particular order, I want fully functioning access to...

Google Mail

Google Docs

Google Notebook

Google Reader

Meebo

FriendFeed

37Signals Backpack

37Signals Highrise

37Signals Basecamp

37Signals Campfire

Of course, if the device has Skype, I will be over the moon.

At the moment, the iPhone can do all of these things standing on it's head. The browser on the Blackberry on the other hand is a complete piece of standard non-compliant garbage.

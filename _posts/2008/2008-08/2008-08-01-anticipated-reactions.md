Do you ever disregard a notion to tell somebody they look great because you fear it will be misinterpreted by the unwashed masses as some kind of "pass" ?

I do.

Whatever happened to more simple times, when you could pass a compliment and it was received with somewhat bashful reticence.

I am of course talking about all of the female bloggers I read. You are numerous, and you are all lovely in your individual ways. I read guys too, but the ladies are more interesting to me - maybe because so few guys break from the stereotype and write about the big subjects - the interesting stuff.

Male written blogs seem to either be intensely technical in nature, or boasts of manly prowess at some sport, hobby, or inane obsession (such as building hilariously detailed scale lego models).

Female blogs on the other hand, almost always deal with life. The interesting stuff. Conflict, relationships, love, hate, angst, happiness. They tend to be far more introspective, and afford the reader more chance to know the writer.

I'll shut up now. It's 1am and I have been sat here pretty much non stop since 9 this morning (which was prepended with 2 hours of getting the kids up and fed, and will be again tomorrow, which is only 6 hours away now).

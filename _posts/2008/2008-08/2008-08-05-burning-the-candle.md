Have you ever heard the expression "burning the candle at both ends" ? It accurately describes my life at the moment.

Continually tired, but having so much fun working that I don't mind one bit.

Somehow I managed to scrape myself out of bed at 5:30am again this morning, and was met shortly before leaving the house at 7am by a little girl skipping through the kitchen.

"What are you doing up? Come on - back to your bedroom 

"I have to go to work in a minute, and Mum isn't even awake yet!"

No response.

"Here you go - I'll open your curtains and blinds so you can play in your room."

No response.

"See you later..."

By now she was face down on the carpet, face in hands, with her bum in the air. Her individual method of protest. The youngest tends to look at you with big teary eyes and a huge wibbly bottom lip. The eldest crosses her arms and looks down at the floor.

"Have fun swimming today with Mum..."

She looks up with a smile, I say my goodbyes, and wander back downstairs to leave the house. I wander through the early morning streets to the train station lugging my bag and a laptop, slump down on the train, buy a ticket, and listen to Macbreak Weekly as the train rolls towards London.

At cookham the hag from hell gets on and given an entire carriage to sit anywhere, sits opposite me. I am going to have to find somewhere else to sit - either that or give her a slip of paper with the URL of my blog post about her.

I accidentally drop my bag on her feet and she doesn't move. Perhaps they are false feet after a spectacular Spitfire crash or something?

A pretty blonde lady has sat down next to me - perhaps that's why the hag is being so insular today - intimidated by the pretty young thing sat across from her.

Who knows.

The journey passes easily enough and we are in London after a few more pages of "On the Road". Again, women look at the book and then look me up and down while on the underground. Strange.

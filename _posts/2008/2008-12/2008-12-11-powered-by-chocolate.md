I have finally arrived at work this afternoon after attending our youngest child's nativity play this morning, getting in trouble with HR for not updating my work calendar, and struggling against a bad cold.

I'm going down hill all the time - coughing, sneezing, going deaf, and generally feeling like crap.

So far today - in an effort to provide some for of energy boost, I have eaten a chocolate muffin, a 250g bar of chocolate, half a big bottle of Lucozade (energy drink), eaten two strepsils (sore throat lozenges), taken two nurofen, and have Lemsip lined up (paracetamol lemon drink).

To be honest, I'm not getting much done - my head is far too fuzzy to think straight...

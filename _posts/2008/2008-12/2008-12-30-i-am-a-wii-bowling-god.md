I just scored 240-something on Wii Bowling. Such is my delirium that I don't know the exact score.

I got seven strikes in a row. Towards the end of my ascendancy to a higher bowling plane, I began having lucky feet to stand on, lucky amounts to swing my bowling arm, and all manner of other obsessive compulsive details became glaringly obvious to me.

Yes, I know there are ten year olds on YouTube bowling perfect scores every day, but I am not a ten year old. I'm a tall, gangly idiot with little co-ordination. I could probably write the physics engine behind Wii bowling in several different programming languages, but throwing a pretend bowling ball down an imaginary bowling alley is a different matter entirely.

Any why was I playing Wii Bowling at 11pm at night? Because I had my ass handed to me by my eight year old daughter earlier.

Yes, I am practicing in order to beat my children at games they will eventually destroy me at - hanging on to the slight advantage I still hold for as long as possible... until next week perhaps.

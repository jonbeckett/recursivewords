What light through yonder window breaks ?

It is the east, and my immune system is the sun.

Yes, finally, today my immune system seems to have begun the fight back. Following several days on the absolute limit of various publicly available drugs, suffering partial deafness and loss of balance as a result, my body seems to have realised it should start helping me out today.

I've come off everything, and have spent the evening coughing big chunks of my lungs up - but not consistently. My nose and throat seem to be surviving for an hour or more at a time too - better than the 15 minutes I was lasting yesterday morning.

What I really could do with is a 250g bar of chocolate. I'm sure I can think of a reason why it would help my health too.

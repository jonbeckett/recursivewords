At lunchtime today, two things happened that made me realise once again that I will be more than glad to get out of the city - to no longer have to ignore the appalling behaviour of others.

In a certain large chemist in Liverpool Street station at lunchtime, a typical career girl in a beret and woolen suit knocked over a display of something or other. Rather than pick it up, she walked off - at speed - completely ignoring the devestation she just caused.

While walking back towards the office, I got caught on the wrong side of a narrow path past some roadworks. In the end I started counting - about fifty people walked past, and none of them gave way to let me out. Not one.

It's easy to forget however that my normal route to work involves cycling through the middle of a small town - which is typically filled with Mum's delivering their children to school in various forms of tank, and no regard for the rest of humanity at all.

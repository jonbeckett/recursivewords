After working for something in the region of 12 hours yesterday, and then commuting into London today on the usual 5am / 7pm schedule, I think I've earned the right to do as little as possible this evening.

This is going to sound a bit weird. I was given the idea of procrastinating by a very good friend (you can read her excuse here) - shows just how stupid I am - I NEEDED somebody to give me the idea of doing nothing.

Hey - this isn't just any lazing about though - I am wearing my biggest, thickest chunky knit jumper that W made me a couple of years ago (that's rapidly becoming so stretched that I look like the Robots from Laputa).

I have the most ridiculous headphones on ever, and am listening to Equinoxe by Jean Michel Jarre.

This blog post is being written on the little EEE PC, perched on the dining room table. Behind it rests my crumpler bag - the one that accompanies me into London every day, and contains anything and everything I might need to geek out with.

The iPhone is busy drinking electricity after doing itself proud and lasting 2 whole days on one charge. Just.

Tomorrow is another day in London. Yay. Not.

After spending our first Christmas with children, more toys than most toy shops, a house full of family, and numerous inter-continental webcam calls, we are still here to tell the tale.

It's been hard work, stressful, but ultimately very rewarding. We took hours of video, and hundreds of photographs - here are a few I'm willing to let the world see...

Brushing teeth before bedtime...

Falling asleep while Mum reads...

Building Trainsets

The Aftermath

One day soon I promise to start opening up a little with photos of the children. There is news in that department, but until a particular hurdle is cleared in the coming weeks, I don't want to do anything.

The past year has been hard - wanting so much to share the three beautiful little girls who call us Mummy and Daddy, and not being able to for all sorts of reasons.

If I don't get a chance to write something before the new year, here's to us and to you, whoever you might be. Thankyou to all our friends who have supported us, held our hands at times, and been there for us to lean on. You'll never know how much we think of you all.

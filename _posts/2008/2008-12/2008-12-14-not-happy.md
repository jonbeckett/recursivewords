In order to at least "be there" for our eldest's swimming lesson, and the adopters end of year party, I am doped up to the eyeballs on headache tablets, soar throat tablets, decongestants, and expectorants.

It's the first time I have been really ill ALL YEAR. My other half is angry with me for not helping enough, the kids are driving me round the bend, and just to make matters worse I have an entire week of commuting into London ahead of me to finish and hand over some of the most complex code I have ever written.

Anybody in their right mind would be in bed today, and tomorrow.

I am not. I'm trying to do the best thing for everybody else (as per usual) and nobody seems to care about me.

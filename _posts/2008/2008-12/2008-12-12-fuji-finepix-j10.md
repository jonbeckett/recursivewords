The postman finally delivered our new camera earlier today - a tiny Fuji Finepix J10 - it replaces the small Sony W55 that I lost somewhere in Oxfordshire a few months ago.

Here are a couple of images I took while playing with it a few minutes ago to make sure it works...

The camera has less external controls than our previous one did - most of its functionality being available through the menu system. The most visible missing control is a programme selector - you need to go through the menu to choose movie, auto, manual, portrait, etc.

One huge plus is that the camera happily works with high density SD cards - so I stuck a spare 8Gb card straight in it - meaning it's good for about 3500 8 megapixel images. It remains to be seen how long the battery will last though (its a replaceable lithium ion).

The actual camera is TINY. Perhaps 10% smaller than the Sony was. Our next acquisition will no doubt be a high visibility neoprene bag for it - this time with a carabiner to help fasten to belt loops in a hurry.

I'll take some more pictures in daylight over the weekend to see what it can really do.

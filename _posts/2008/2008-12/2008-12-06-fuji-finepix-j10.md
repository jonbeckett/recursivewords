I just put an order in with Amazon for a replacement for the camera I lost a while ago. After looking around for something small, inexpensive, and with decent reviews I went with the Fuji Finepix J10.

I only bought a 2 gig card to go in it, but I don't anticipate it becoming full - it will only ever be used for snaps, and will live for most of its life in W's bag. While mobile phone cameras are all well and good, they are never anywhere near as good as something that was designed from the outset to be a camera. When it arrives next week I'll post some example photos.

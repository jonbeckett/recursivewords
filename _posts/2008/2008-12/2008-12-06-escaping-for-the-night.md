Following military style preparation and planning, we escaped our "family of five" status for a few hours last night, and went out to dinner with some friends who live a few miles away.

Great company + great food + nice wine + funny stories = great night.

I don't have much else to say about it really - other than an affirmation that we need to do it more often.

This was the second time (since February) that we have had a night out, and we really enjoyed it. I will admit to being a bit paranoid about letting our conversation drift towards the children - I remember the times before we had children, and being bored by new parents with a one track conversation.

Since Twitter first appeared on the internet, I have been a somewhat reluctant participant. I've somehow amassed over 200 followers, who probably don't take any notice of my "tweets", let alone log in and even see them.

Twitter is something of an enigma on the internet - an application that shouldn't succeed, and yet here it is - growing like a wild fire. In it's earlier days it suffered significant scaling problems and was down more than up. Those days seem to be behind it now though.

I have difficulty explaining Twitter to those who have never heard of it - and often find myself wondering what on earth use it is while explaining the validity of it's existence. Wikipedia describes it as follows;

Twitter is a free social networking and micro-blogging service, that allows its users to send and read other users' updates (otherwise known as tweets), which are text-based posts of up to 140 characters in length.

I'm tempted to explore the possibility of taking a more active part in the twitter universe, and courting new subscribers to my stream of useless tosh. I'm also tempted to not use it at all. Twitter seems to be designed for the narcissist in all of us, and I'm not so sure that's a good thing.

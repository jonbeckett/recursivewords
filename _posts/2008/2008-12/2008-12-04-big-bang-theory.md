While flicking through the TV channels late one night a few months ago, myself and W happened upon a sitcom filled with geeks, and found ourselves sucked in. We had not idea what it was called, but laughed like drains right the way through it (I'm guessing I am W's frame of reference for "geek").

A few weeks back we found the show again, and discovered it was called "The Big Bang Theory".

Tonight I discovered it's available on DVD, and has become the top item on my Christmas list. If you're reading this W, please please please please  xx lol

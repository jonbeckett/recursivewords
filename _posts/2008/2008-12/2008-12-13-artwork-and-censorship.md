While surfing around the various communities on LiveJournal earlier today, I kept tripping over various art or photographic post labelled "NSFW" - "Not Safe for Work". It got me thinking about the artwork and photography I did while at college - the hours I spent drawing or photographing people with very little covering themselves.

While digging around the computer recently I turned this up too;

There are more images that I just made available to the world and it's dog - visit Picasa to see more.

Why is the naked human form so frowned upon? Why is it a taboo? The whole argument reminds me of a conversation I had some time ago - why is it okay to show genitalia on an operating table, but not doing the job it was intended for ?

Recently in the UK there was a documentary aimed at young people that showed a young lad with blisters on his penis following removal of warts - I'm guessing the show would have been taken off the air if a girl's labia had been shown.

We live in a very strange world - at the same time as we are repeatedly told we are beautiful, we are also expected to deny the existence of various parts of our body, and certainly not expected to approve if others do not cover up.

At the same time, the most famous people in the world are those known to look good without clothes, and if a press photographer manages to take a photo up their skirt, they become headline news around the planet.

We live in a world of contradictions.

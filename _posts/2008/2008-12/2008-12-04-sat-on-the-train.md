I'm heading home from work early today in order for my other half to become "Brown Owl" once again.

This means leaving at 3pm to have a hope of getting back by 6pm. I didn't leave until 3:10 - so ended up sat in Paddington for half an hour answering phone calls from work. It also meant getting cash from a hole in the wall - an insurance policy (taxi money) to get home in time.

Do you ever have days when you just want to go hide somewhere? I do. The last two or three weeks.

Postscript - I finally got home at 6:30pm. My other half didn't go to Brownies anyway because she has a bad cold. It took me 3 and a half hours to get home - partly because I didn't leave the office until 3:10pm - which then cascaded through my journey into missing trains all the way along the line - and then W called me as I was approaching Maidenhead. While talking to our youngest on the phone, I didn't even notice the train stop. I carried straight on to Reading, did an about face, and started home again in the opposite direction. All in all, a pretty crappy day to end a crappy couple of weeks.

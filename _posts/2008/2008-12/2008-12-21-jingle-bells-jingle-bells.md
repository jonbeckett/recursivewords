Our house is now on the final run in towards Christmas - our first with children. It's hard work, draining, and exciting all at the same time. While slogging from day to day (trying to get better from the awful cold I've had at the same time), I have a few observations to share;

Four year old's eyes are bigger than their belly.

When you are walking back from Christmas shopping with a three year old and a four year old, and the three year old throws herself on the floor and starts screaming, it's not actually that funny when other parents laugh. You do see the funny side later.

When the four year old says she is bursting for a wee halfway between the shops and home, that's not funny either.

Apparently walking fast to get home before weeing yourself becomes hard work - at which point the little girl in question will say "I can't walk fast - my tummy is asleep!" - I have not deciphered it yet either.

The above all came from a visit to town this afternoon to get Christmas presents for W from them. I tried to give them as much freedom as possible, but had to intervene when they chose a football and aftershave set. A big bag of chocolate gold coins also had to be put back, more than once. The shopping trip also entailed buying lightbulbs, bread, and a huge supply of rechargeable batteries (and a half hour charger). We anticipate the Wii being played A LOT this Christmas.

Taking the little ones out for the afternoon freed W up to get some clearing up down around the house for the first time in days. I returned home to an 18ft high pile of ironing, and half a clean kitchen. The kids are off to visit their grandparents for the day tomorrow to afford us the chance to get their presents wrapped and tidy the house up before the great destruction really begins on Thursday. Wednesday is already a write-off because we have friends visiting for the day.

I went to Reading on a mad Christmas shopping run yesterday with our eldest. After walking into the first shop, her coat was too hot, her legs were too tired, and she couldn't take it any more. After some serious words about me giving Father Christmas a call, and taking off her his list, she shut up for - ooo - five minutes. I finally offered that we could perhaps get her and her sisters something from the Disney Store. Miraculous cure.

Some observations about the Disney Store;

The High School Musical Cheerleader Costumes look like they came straight off a porn movie shoot.

Apparently selling 2 movies in one box in the Disney store is a great deal at twice the price.

Never have badges caused such ridiculous prices anywhere in the world ever.

Sales don't exist in the Disney universe.

The female staff of Disney stores are obviously vetted - there are no fat or ugly girls working there. I'm not sure how legal that is these days.

While walking back from the big play park in the middle of town earlier today, we turned ourselves into a mobile roadblock - getting in the way of the several hundred people trying to pass us in both directions. In the end we went single-file, which I don't like doing because I can't watch the girls properly. While craning around in a crowd to see where our four year old way, she piped up "it's okay Dad - I'm right behind you - don't worry".

She is old beyond her years sometimes.

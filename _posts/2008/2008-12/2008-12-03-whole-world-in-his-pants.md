While little miss 4 years old was wandering around the house the other day, W overheard her singing

"He's got the whole world, in his pants"

"He's got the whole wide world, in his pants"

"He's got the whole world, in his pants"

"He's got the whole world in his pants".

This goes with her other favourite song of the moment..

"Jesus... Sun is Hot" (we think it should be Son of God, but she takes no notice of our corrections).

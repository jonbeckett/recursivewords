Today was a day to forget. A day where you run like mad, and get nowhere. A day where you turn every corner, chase down every dark alleyand you always end up at the place you starteda waking nightmare of sorts. Therefore the blog becomes an escape this evening. Not a place to dissect the daymore a place to daydreamto divert.

I'm listening to the soundtrack from "The Social Network", stored on the new Nokia mobile. I'm pretty pleased with it so faraside from a few issues with applications, it works well. There are bizarre omissions, such as the Outlook contacts not having photos, and the Facebook profile photo sync seemingly only working when it feels like it, but otherwisevery impressed. The battery life is stellar.

I find it difficult to switch off from workespecially when the future of a project is uncertain. My mind reverts back in the quiet moments, and I end up walking in the next day with all manner of solutions planned out in my head. I need to learn to walk away. While writing this I keep drifting off, thinking about phone calls in the morningnext stepsclimbing the mountain.

Some people hide behind alcohol when problems mount around themI tend to do the opposite. I have to be sharp, awake, lucid. The last thing a client wants is a software developer firing on half his cylinders, building more problems. Coffee is my friend.

Maybe tonight will be a good night to start reading the book I bought at the weekend.

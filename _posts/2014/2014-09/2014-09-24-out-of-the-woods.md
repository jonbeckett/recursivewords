After a seemingly endless struggle over the last few days, I can finally see the top of the mountain I've been climbing. I can finally begin to relax. While I can't write about the nature of the mountain, I can express my relief.

Although I rarely "blog my own trumpet", I have come to realise that I'm better than most at knuckling down and just getting on with things. Keeping calm, and carrying on. It's tempting to repeat well known phrases, but I cringe before my fingers even hit the keys.

During the last few hours of each day this week, the internet has provided an infinite escape. A rabbit hole though which I jump via a slab of glass to catch up with distant friends.

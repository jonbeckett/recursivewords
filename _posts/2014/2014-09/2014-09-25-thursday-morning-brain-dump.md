I know I was buried under a mountain of workearlier in the week, but how on earth is it Thursday already ? Did the first part of the week happen at all ?For the first time in ages I sat with my other half and watched television last night (after transferring a domain name, because you all know I can't leave the computer alone for an entire nightwe'll write about the hosting account configuration debacle another time). The TV show was some series about a family moving to a new townin the 1950s, and starting a zoo. We watched two episodes in a row, to catch up with those already broadcast, and then ran out. Why on earth are TV shows made available one at a time online? Why not just release the whole lot? I know Netflix do itwhy can't the BBC? (rant over)And they wonder why so many people download entire series via bittorrent (ok I promise rant is really over now).

I've been thinking about ditching Tumblr again over the last few days, and just concentrating on this blog. If I give myself too many places to mess around online, I end up not using any of them. It would be better to just do thisand do it well, than cross post, or selectively share different things in different places. I won't delete the Tumblrjust park it for a while. Maybe rename it. Repurpose it. Perhaps turn it more into a scrapbook. I don't know Maybe I just sit on my hands for a while and don't touch ittry not to over-think it.

I go through these "all change" scenarios every few months. It's become a running joke"where will he migrate his blog to this month?", or "where will he be spending his time online this week?" Given that I always return to WordPress, it's kind of a no-brainer that I should just live here really.

Of course before I can build the new blog (for the semi-professional blatherings), I need to get the hosting account sorted outwhich doesn't appear to be happening in a hurry at all. I already promised I wouldn't start about that, didn't I. Do you see why this blog is called "recursive words" now ?p.s. if you made it this far through this very, very boring post, you deserve a medal.

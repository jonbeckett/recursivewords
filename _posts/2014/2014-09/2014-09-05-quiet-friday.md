It's the final day off for meif the kids sort themselves out (get dressed, wash their faces, brush their teeth, brush their hair), we might head on the bikes to a play park on the other side of town. I promised yesterday, but we ended up spending the day fixing and cleaning the bikes.When I arrived on the drive with the pressure washer, the kids started clapping and hopping up and down easily pleased.

Last night I switched the tablets aroundfor the last couple of years I have been carrying a Google Nexus 7 around with me, and the kids have had a Kindle Fire HD. Given that there is a huge amount more software in the Google Play app store, we switched them. So far I've been massively impressed with the Kindle Firetime will tell if that initial impression changes.

RIghttime to sort myself outlittle girls are cycling up and down the drive, looking impatient.

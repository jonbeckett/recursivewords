It all started innocently enough. Given that the guy I have been working with in London was working from home, there was no reason for me to make the journey in either. An extra hour in bed!As 9am approached I swept the final remnants of breakfast into the dishwasher, and set about clearing the desk in the study. The client laptop connected successfully via VPN, and I was away and running only I soon needed to retrieve code from the source code repository at the officewhich meant firing up a different laptop, with a different VPN client installed.

Before long I had google searches running on the desktop computer, debugging going on the netbook, compilation on the client computer, and numerous conversations happening via Lync on two of the laptops at the same time.

Madness.

More than once I found myself wiggling the mouse and finding the pointer wasn't moving, or typing and wondering why the letters were not appearing, before realising I was looking at the wrong screen.

In the middle of the mayhem a friend messaged me on my phone and asked "how's it going?"I replied "tired and stressed!".

Let's hope tomorrow involves less screens, less keyboards, and less micefor the sake of my own sanity.

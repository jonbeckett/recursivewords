Spending your birthday on your own, with nobody else knowing is a very strange experienceperhaps more so if your normal world is a family home, full of chaos and craziness.

While I could have told my temporary co-workers the significance of the day, it would have opened a can of worms that I would rather avoidblurring the client relationship somewhat. There's also the whole thing about people wanting to be seen to take an interest in others, when in reality they don't care at all. I would rather avoid putting people in that situation.

The number of birthday messages I received on the social networks was quite a shock. I never think of myself as having many friends.

I went out to a pizza restaurant across the plaza from the hotel this evening, walked in, and greeted the waitress with "just me!". She smiled, and beckoned me to the small tables near the window. At least when you're eating alone you can go when you want, not wait hours for anybody else, and not have to make asinine conversation for hours on end.

I'm not entirely sure how it happened, but 7 hours appear to have vanished since I left the office this evening, and I've done pretty much nothing. Maybe it's a new skill.

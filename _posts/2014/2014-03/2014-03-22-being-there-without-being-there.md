Our eldest (Miss 13) has gone on a school trip to an amusement park today. I got her up, organised, made sure she had everything she needed, and walked to the school where the coaches are arriving with her.

A hundred yards before the school gates I stopped, and watched her walk the last bit on her ownbecause I didn't want to ruin her street cred.

I guess this is my lot for the next few yearsbeing there without being there. Kind of feel like a plain clothes Batmanwithout the gadgets, or any kind of plan.

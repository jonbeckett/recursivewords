Before I get started on yet another head emptying episode, I would just like to comment that tea is rubbish as a stimulant. After charging home from London this evening, and downing two large glasses of wine while watching the first half of the movie "Hackers" with our eldest daughter, sleep almost overtook me. I was roused by the arrive of the local Brownie troop (read: W and the younger girls), and set about making a cup of tea to wake myself up. It didn't work.

Anyway. It's Thursday night, and the end of another four day stretch in London. It's now two weeks since I was last in the office, and I'm beginning to forget what it's likeyou knowhaving a "normal" job, like "normal" people.

Getting up at 5:30am every day kind of chips away at you. On the way home this evening a wave of tiredness swept over me, and it was all I could do to avoid slipping into a deep, deep sleep. I can only remember one occasion where I fell asleepback when I worked in the city during 2007/2008and woke with a start on the train with dribble on my tie.

I guess it didn't help that I went to the local brewery open night last night with my brother and father-in-law. I went on an intentional go-slow, and had about three pints. They had almost double that amount as far as I counted (if I had tried to keep up, I would have had a monster hangover). As is my normal routine, as we left I bought W a couple of bottles of something nice from the shop before leaving. As I made my way through the crowd, I had to ask a small group to move a little so I could reach a particular shelf. They watched as I lifted a bottle of Mead from the shelf, and murmured sounds of approval.

I'm tired. All sorts of tired. I should probably be in bed, but looked at the blog, and realised I hadn't written anything for a number of days. I really am my own worst enemy.

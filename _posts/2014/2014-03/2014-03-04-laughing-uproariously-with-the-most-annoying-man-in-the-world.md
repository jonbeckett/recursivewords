I'm sitting in the lobby of the hotel with a glass of cider. The same pretty businesswoman is holding court in the center of the lobby with her co-workers as last night. Propped on a stool on the corner of the bar sits the most annoying man in the known universe.

At first glance you might think he was an avant guard artist of some kindwith a smock coat, and a beret perched above his manicured beard. Then he opens his mouth.

Every twenty seconds he belches forth a "turned up to 11" laugh that carries to every corner of the hotel lobby. It's not a small lobby. He seems to laugh at everything his friends say, and everything he himself says. At first it's amusing, but after fifteen minutes it's enough to conjur visions of somebodyanybodysneaking up and sawing his chair out from under him like a cartoon villain.

He now appears to have annoyed his friends enough that they have separated into two groupsthe two talking about "gear" when I ordered my drink have sidled off to a quiet corner of the bar. No prizes for guessing what they are talking about.

I need to get back into the habit of writing posts where I just empty my head into the keyboard. I used to do it as naturally as breathing, but as the years have passed it has grown increasingly difficult.

If only blogs existed in the same world as computer software, where you could set the privacy of particular paragraphs. Of course I would make a mistake straight away, and share the incendiary with the world at large, and the mundane with only my closest friends. I'm good at things like that.

Somebody famous once said;If debugging is the process of removing mistakes from a piece of software, software development must therefore be the process of putting bugs into a piece of software.

Following this line of thought, I am in the process of recording a number of mistakes right now. The grammar and punctuation mistakes are of course a givenyou get them for free with my writing.

I was supposed to be emptying my head, but all I've done so far is blather on about nothing in particular. Maybe this blog should be called "nothing in particular", because that's what the posts end up being about normally. They always say you should aim a blog at a nicheperhaps my niche is "nothing in particular".

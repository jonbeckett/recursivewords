After a long day spent untangling requirements, building workflows, and bashing my head against a boardroom desk, this evening broke the monotony somewhata co-worker happened to stay at the same hotel for the evening.

It's a small world. While we are busy wandering the country, and spend most of our time visiting client sites alone, occasionallyvery occasionallywe cross paths. The last time I met this guy was perhaps 18 months ago while on a distant client site, and since then perhaps twice in the office.

I had known our paths were going to cross since the start of the week, but only got round to emailing him this afternoonand then after receiving no reply, began texting. The reply came almost immediately, and it transpired we had missed each other in the corridors of the hotel a few moments earlier.

After arranging to meet in the lobby, we headed to the local pizza restaurant together, and the evening flew past amid stories of recent projects, home, children, life on the road, and all manner of other things.

It was a nice change from the loneliness of the rest of this trip. Tomorrow we have arranged to meet for breakfast before wandering to the client site together. I have become quite the authority on this part of town, so imagine will be leading the way in the morning to visit the office of our client.

In the meantime I'm back in the hotel room, sitting on the bed with the netbook, jumping down the internet rabbit hole once more. If you can't find me, follow the white rabbit with the pocket watch.

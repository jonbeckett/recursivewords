The last few days have turned into a blur of complexity, frustration, elation, and software development done in full view of a room full of clients.

Apparently I start each day well, but by lunchtime the odd "damn" creeps in, and by late afternoon there is a rapid descent as either things don't work as expected, or tiredness creeps in and stupid mistakes are made.

New friendships have been forged, and relationships built that I imagine will endure for years to come.

Evenings throughout the week have been spent perched at the desk in the hotel room, reading articles on the internet, writing blog posts, and somehow burning through six hours or so at a time.

The pull of the internet rabbit hole is strong.

Tomorrow evening I will leave the office for the last time, walk to the station, and begin the epic trek home. Five hours on trains will hopefully pass without incident before tumbling into the house, and the arms of my family.

I miss them.

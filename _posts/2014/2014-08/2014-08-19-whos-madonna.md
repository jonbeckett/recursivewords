One of Miss 14's friends stayed for dinner this evening, and we somehow ended up talking about the media, celebrities, and music. A derogatory comment was made about Miley Cyrus. Being forever the fence sitter, and doing my usual job of opposing just about any opinion anybody has about anything, I entered the conversation."Miley's not that badshe's just the only original act out there pushing the boundaries, and making a LOT of moneyif you stand out, the media are going to stick a big target on your head"The kids kind of nodded, and realised I had a point."She's doing nothing that Madonna didn't do 25 years ago""Who's Madonna?"It was one of those moments when you feel like you're about a thousand years old. Our daughter knows who Madonna is because we have exposed her to all sorts of music since she was really youngfrom the 1960s right through to the present. Her friend thoughI'm clinging to the hope that we can now use her remark as an excuse to push the musical education thing further than before. Get some live concert movies of the artists that have influenced the current crop. Get some posters. Some books.

Atleast I didn't tell them about the metal covered book Madonna made called "Sex" that sits in the attic somewhere, in it's original packaging (it will be worth a fortune one day).

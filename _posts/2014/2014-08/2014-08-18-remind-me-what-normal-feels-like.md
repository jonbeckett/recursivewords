The various things going wrong with me have started to get me down. I've now had the chest infection for three weeks, and a cold for a week. The stiff neck is better. The broken toe is finally healing, although I have to be careful.

I finally caved and called the Doctor today. I think I've been to the Doctor perhaps twice in the last ten years. I was cheerfully told by the receptionist that I could see him next WednesdayI told her that I'll see how I'm doing in another few days, and resort to the "drop in clinic" if all else fails (where you sit in the room for several hours until a nurse has a look at you, and then spends twenty seconds writing a prescription for antibiotics).

They say stress effects your health, so being thrown to the wolves at work at the moment isn't helping. I'm not going to go into any detail, but it's all getting a bit ridiculous. At times it feels like I'm where the buck stops for far too many projects, and nobody else is stepping up to the plate (ok, ok, I'll stop with the metaphors too).

I need to stop using parenthesis toothey are a cheap way out of re-structuring sentences and paragraphs.

It's already 9pm. For some reason 9pm feels like the day is already overthat you'll be in bed soon, and tomorrow will come racing up, and the whole crap-shoot will start again. And again. And again.

I need a cup of tea.

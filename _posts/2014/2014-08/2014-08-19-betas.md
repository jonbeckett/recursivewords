I finally finished watching the first season of the Amazon funded TV show "Betas" this evening. As the titles rolled I headed to the web on my phone, to find out when the second season might appear. There is going to be no second season. Amazon pulled the plug. Months ago.

What the hell, Amazon? It was one of the best TV shows I have seen in ages! Granted, I'm a web developer, and granted, I don't really watch TV any more, so have no perspective whatsoever, but what the hell?Here's hoping that Amazon have not locked the show up in some kind of adamantium exclusivity clause (although I bet they have), and that the show could be resurrected by another entertainment network. Do you think if we all shout loud enough, Yahoo will hear?

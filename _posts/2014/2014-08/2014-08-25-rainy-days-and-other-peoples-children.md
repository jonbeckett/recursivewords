Today is a bank holiday in the UK, so I have the day offwhich is a good job, because it's tipping down with rain, and I feel dreadful. Just to add to the chest infection, I now have a bad head cold. I'm not going to go on and on about feeling awful though (even thought I just did)you don't want to read a "poor is me" post.

It's 1pm already, and we're hiding out in the house. We had planned on having a lazy dayplaying board games with the childrenbut have ended up baby sitting somebody elses children yetagain. It's getting pretty ridiculousthis has happened throughout most of the school summer vacation. I get itthe kids love playing with their friendsbut they don't see the real storythat those kids parents are throwing them out of the house every day. At times over the last few weeks we have had seven or eight children in the house at any one timeand regularly sitting around our dinner table for us to feed.

I wonder why some people have children at allmaybe they are just another trinket to themand the whole "having to bring them up" thing is a huge inconvenience. They are the parents who pay for birthdays to take place elsewherewho don't have a kitchen wallpapered with paintings and drawings, and who don't have junk modelling projects strewn around the house.

I guess it says something about our house that the neighbourhood children choose to come here, rather than stay at home.

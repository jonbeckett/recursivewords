I'm back in the office today after a few days off. I won't lie - I was dreading coming in this morning for all sorts of reasons. Of course it turns out that the situation is nowhere near as bleak as I imagined, and my fears were pretty much unfounded. For the moment. If all of this sounds tremendously vague, it is intentional. No apologies.

So. It's lunchtime. I have a few minutes remaining before I need to get on with some work.

I have just started typing this sentence three times, and deleted it each time. You really needed to know that, didn't you. All the while, the clock is ticking down, and I still have nothing of importance to share. Not that I everhave anything of importance to share, let's face it.

p.s. I just ordered an Amazon Fire TV, and the game controller for it, which means we finally move the XBox 360 out of the lounge.

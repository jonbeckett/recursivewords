Got up before everybody else this morning, made everybody else breakfast, washed up, took youngest to football practice, wandered home, made everybody lunch, washed up, ironed clothes for 4 hours, ate dinner, washed up after everybody, watched a bit of TV with everybody, and am now hiding in the study at 10pm, wondering how other people even think about having weekends, or hobbies, or anything like that really...

For some reason known only to herself, our eldest daughter went nuclear again today. After a week or so being reasonable and friendly with everybody, today she flipped out, and I had to remove her from the car with physical force - a full on toddler tantrum (she's 14). She has shut herself in her room ever since. I'm thinking about changing the WiFi password, to further pull the rug out from under her. I haven't done it yet. Tomorrow will be steamrollered by a rugby tournament for our middle daughter. We will have to leave early, and I'm guessing we won't return before mid to late afternoon - so Sunday is pretty much a write-off too. Please excuse me while I stay up ridiculously late, claiming a few hours for myself to go surf the internet, play crappy old video games, and try to escape the mayhem for a bit.

The Blogger experiment is over. I'm back at WordPress again. I'm not going to explain why, because anybody that knows me with stop listening (I move blog platforms every other month on average). Let's just say Blogger was fun, and so is WordPress, and we can all get along together, and the sun (isn't) shining, and it (isn't) a hummy kind of day.

Who would ever guess I was reading Winnie the Pooh to the children at bedtime last night?I'm burning up the remains of my lunchbreak writing this. I'm home again, after visiting the office for a couple of hours. With a little luck a nice parcel delivery guy will arrive at some point this afternoon, armed with a shiny new Amazon Kindle Fire HD to replace the one that died on it's arse last weekend. I'm already thinking about making it "my tablet" after experiencing the mess Google has made of Lollipop on the 1st gen Nexus 7.

In other news, my mobile phone is still on the fritz. If I go anywhere near the podcast app it kills the data connectionI have to fiddle with arcane settings deep in the phone's innards to get it to come back to life (a trick discovered completely by luck). I'm wondering if it's a software bugbecause since keeping away from the podcasts, it has behaved perfectly. I just keep thinking "January" in my headbecause then I can replace it with something else. Don't get me wrongI actually like the phonemainly because it lasts a couple of days on a chargebut the apps for Windows Phones are miles behind Android and iOS.

I might even consider going back to an iPhone in January.

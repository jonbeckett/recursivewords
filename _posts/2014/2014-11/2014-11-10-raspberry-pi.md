I just ordered a Raspberry Pi model B+ from Amazon, for delivery to work later in the week. I have no idea why I have ordered it. I have no real use for it, other than the "excuse" of teaching the kids how computers work - but I could do that without a Raspberry Pi.

I'm tempted to use it as a very small web server, and leave it running somewhere on the network at home. If I can then somehow do port forwarding from the router, and wire up a subdomain, I'll be laughing - it will be a party-piece of sorts - to show people a web server running on the corner of the desk at home.

I bought a case, and a USB wifi dongle for it too - so it can connect to the network.

The basic Linux distro for the Raspberry Pi has the "Scratch" programming language installed on it - I might sit down with our eldest daughter, and show her how to build things with it - it goes without saying that I could probably build things that would confuse her teacher immensely (and make the kids in the class gasp in wonder).

This has been a geek post on behalf of the Nerd party. Back to hum-drum life tomorrow, maybe...

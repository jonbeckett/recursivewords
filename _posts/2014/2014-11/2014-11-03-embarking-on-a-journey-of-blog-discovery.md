This evening I am heading out across the vast stretches of the internet in search of bloggers taking part in NaBloPoMo. I will follow a collection of them via Feedly, and try to keep up with their writing throughout the month of madness. It feels like I'm bringing 2006 back from the dead - I did a similar thing back during the first run of NaBloPoMo, and made some friends online that have somehow survived the last 8 years. Has it really been 8 years? It seems like such a long time when you write it down, and look at the number - it doesn't seem that long ago at all.

Eight years ago we had no children. Eight years ago we were in the midst of our second round of IVF, and burning money like we were throwing it on a bonfire by the wheelbarrow full. My career hasn't changed since back then - I'm still doing exactly the same job - still headbutting my desk on a daily basis, and still riding a mountain bike to the office and back, rain or shine.

A co-worker remarked about the photo I posted to Facebook, taken by our daughter at the Halloween party on Friday night. Apparently I looked young. I didn't quite know how to respond (I thought I looked horrendous - I had just removed skeleton face paint when the photo was taken, and still had dark shadows under my eyes). I guess compared to some people I know, I am aging fairly well. The mountain bike must take a lot of the credit - and eating a half-way sensible diet (we can't afford to buy junk all the time).

Anyway... I'm rambling.

I should have set off across the internet on this damn fool crusade already. If I happen to comment on your blog, greetings and salutations. I guess in Gandalf's terms, I am a blogger of the old world - a Balrog of sorts. Not quite so bursting with flames, or evil intentions though - more of a Baggins than a Balrog, which isn't that surprising - I grew up in Oxfordshire; "The Shire"...

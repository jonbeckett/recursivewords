We are heading out to a friends for dinner in a few minutes. I'll probably be back before midnight, but just in case (and in order to keep up the NaBloPoMo thing), I'm posting these few words. A few words still counts, right?

Today has been just a bit crazy.

I found myself standing at the side of a football pitch for the first couple of hours of the day watching our youngest. Even though it was only training, I'm continually surprised how many parents drop their children off, and then vanish until minutes before the end of the session. I wandered over to the garage across the road to get a coffee after the training session got under way, and found myself stood in the queue behind one of the coaches - buying coffees for all the other coaches. The queue went nowhere for ten minutes...

Once home, I hit the ground running - as I always seem to - washed up two sink fulls of breakfast things (the dishwasher is broken), and put a load of washing on the clothes airer (the tumble dryer is also broken). Just as I made my third trip out to the rubbish bins while tidying up, my other half returned home from the local school, where she had been helping sort out their storage sheds with a friend. I can't help wondering how other parents think schools function - they must imagine each school has fairies that just "make things happen"...

This afternoon I took our eldest into town to use her bank card for the first time. She was absolutely terrified, but once she had bought her first things (some pens in a stationers), she had the biggest grin. I just need to keep re-inforcing that she knows her pin number, and has a vague idea how much is left in her account (we top it up with a standing order). Having a bank account for her is going to make presents from relatives much easier - although saying that, I always think it's nice to get "things" for birthdays and Christmas instead of just money.

Right... I need to get a move on. We're supposed to be at our friends in ten minutes.

I guess this wasn't such a short post after all...

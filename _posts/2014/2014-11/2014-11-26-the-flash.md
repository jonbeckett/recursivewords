Over the last month or so I have been downloading a television show from the internet for our children to watch called "The Flash". I say "for our children", but the arrival of each new episode has rapidly become a family event.

The interesting thing is all we knew about "The Flash" ahead of the TV show appearing was Sheldon Cooper's shirts in Big Bang Theory. Neither myself or my other half read comics as children, so we really had no idea about this guy wearing a red suit. We came into this whole thing blind.

I think half the reason the show is doing so wellat least in our houseis because it's the kind of TV show nobody makes any more. A show with a positive message, and stories with enough layers for both children and adults to enjoy. While watching it I have have been reminded of the TV shows we grew up watchingBuck Rogers, Wonderwoman, The Dukes of Hazard, Automan, Knight Rider, Airwolf, The A-TeamIt seems that the target audience of television shows has been focussed too far. Children are targetted with Spongebob Squarepants, My Little Pony, The Wizards of Waverley Place, Hannah Montana. The "Saturday evening adventure series" has vanishedreplaced by quiz shows, and cash-in-the-attic idiocy.

Let's hope "The Flash" is the beginning of a re-discovery of family television.

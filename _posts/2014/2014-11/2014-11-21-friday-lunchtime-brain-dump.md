I'm in the middle of preparing for a "webinar" on Monday - presenting clever stuff to people all over the place to do with my work. I would like to say there was a grand plan behind me becoming one of the most knowledgeable people in the country about a rather narrow field of information technology geekery, but no - it's all been a huge accident really. I am surrounded by pages of scribbled writing, powerpoint slides, and half-built demonstrations in virtual machines.

I've lost you already, haven't I.

When I get home from work on an evening, we generally try to have dinner together, and sit eating while everybody shares their day with everybody else. Actually, that's not completely true. Everybody except me shares their day. I once remarked on it, and my other half stopped our middle girl recounting her story of receiving a sticker for a good spelling test;

"Go on then. What did you do today?"

"I made a change to a workflow in SharePoint to let it copy documents directly into a document set and re-title them at the same time during the creation of a case in a case management system, and then made it email the team of case workers with links to the documents to work on them."

"... and that's why we don't ask you what you did today."

I have never been invited to tell my story of the day since.

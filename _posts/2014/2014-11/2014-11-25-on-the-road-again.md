I woke up five minutes before the alarm went off this morning, leaned across the bedside table, and switched it off. 5:25am. I then fell back asleep, and had an amazing dream where all kinds of things happenedand woke up again with a start, sure that I had overslept10 minutes later.

After dragging myself out of bed, into the shower, and into work clothes, I packed my bag and slipped from the house into the sub-zero morning air to catch the first of several trains across the country. My destination was Winchester, near the south coastnot that I saw any of it, because I walked directly from the railway station to the office, sat in the office all day (and missed lunch because everything went pear shaped), and then walked back to the station through driving rain in the dark this evening.

My phone crapped out again todaylosing it's internet connection repeatedly. I'm doing a factory reset this eveningif it is not resloved, I'll be taking it into the phone shop over the next couple of days to hopefully get it fixed. I'm guessing if the reset doesn't work, it's hardwareeither the handset, or the SIM card. While checking the details of the SIM contract last night, I noticed I can upgrade in January. I'm not entirely sure if I can upgrade thoughI already traded the old handset in (I used to have a Samsung S3).

I'm wondering if Apple will have sorted out the numerous bugs with the iPhone 6 by January? The Google Nexus 5 is still an amazing phone for the money thoughand has no crapware on it (unlike the iPhone 6, which will soon be gaining Beats streaming audio, if you like it or notoh, you hadn't heard about that?)Anyway.

On my way through Reading Station this evening I picked up a box of Hotel Chocolat chocolates for my other half (who had just ranted non-stop at me when I finally did get my phone working), and presented them to her after arriving homenot that she noticed, because she started again the moment I walked in.

I read Winnie the Pooh to the younger children at bedtime tonightthe story about Pooh's "Expitition" to the "North Pole". Our eldest isn't speaking to anybody againthis time because my other half wouldn't give her the password for her (my other half's) iPad

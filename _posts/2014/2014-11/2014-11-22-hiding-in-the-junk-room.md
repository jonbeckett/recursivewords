I used to call this place the "study", but in reality it's "the junk room". A leftover room in the house where we used to put things "out of the way". Since having the children the room became "the room where the kids won't wreck stuff", and then it evolved into "the room where the computers are".

Anyway... I'm hiding in here. The rest of the family are watching Saturday evening television. I think "Atlantis" is on at the moment - which started out in it's first season as the story of some guy pulled through a tear in the fabric of space and time to the ancient city of Atlantis. Within a few episodes the script writers forgot all about his knowledge of the modern world, and it's become a dumbed down re-counting of the various greek myths each week - except this time Hercules and Pythagoras are involed in every adventure along with "Jason" (yes, it appears he is that Jason).

So yeah... I kind of stopped watching Atlantis.

I've been messing around with the Nexus 7 tablet this evening - wondering if I might sell it. I made the mistake of "upgrading" it to Android 5.0 last week, and it's been awful ever since. For most people it would probably be fine, but for me... nope. The kids might find that they lose their Kindle Fire tablet over the coming few weeks - at least until I buy a new Fire tablet for myself. I think the main problem I have with Google is that they have needlessly changed the Android launcher and keyboard again. There was nothing wrong with them before. I actually prefer the Amazon fork of Android now, and that's saying something.

We have a day off from Rugby tomorrow - visiting W's parents for the day. I'm looking forward to it because I haven't seen them for a while - plus it's a day out of the "routine" we have been in for the last few months. It does mean tomorrow evening will be mayhem though - washing school clothes, and trying to get the dried and pressed ready for the next morning.

Anyway. Time to go make a coffee, and show my face in the lounge.

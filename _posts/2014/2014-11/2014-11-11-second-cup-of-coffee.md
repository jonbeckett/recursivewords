My word - this blog is just stunningly interesting this week. I literally have nothingto write about. Actually, that's a lie - I do have something to write about, that was on my mind all last night, but I'm not going to write about it today - or any time soon really.

I'm sitting in the office on my own. I was here alone yesterday too. I think I may be alone for the next few weeks to be honest. It's odd - being on your own in an office. I'm the only person on the third floor - there are two or three people in on the second floor, and three people that I know of on the first floor. I have never known the office this quiet...

I wrote the first half of this email two hours ago, and it's been sitting in a browser tab to one side of the screen ever since - while I methodically headbutted my desk in frustration (the Ubuntu FTP server isn't working in a virtual machine I'm tinkering with - you didn't really need to know that though).

It's 4:30pm now, and it's already dark outside. Fantastic.

Oh! I do have something to write about! I watched the first episode of "The Arrow" last night. While I'll admit I have never read the comic (and didn't know the character existed before the TV show appeared), I am somewhat mystified that it has received such a good reception in the US. Correct me if I'm wrong, but The Arrow is pretty much Batman with a bow and arrow, right ? Same kind of rich-kid origin story, but now a mysteriously athletic nutcase that shoots baddies for fun with arrows, and escapes the law by the skin of this teeth.

I'm not sure I'm going to bother watching any more episodes.

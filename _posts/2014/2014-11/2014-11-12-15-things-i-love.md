Tagged by Lacey over at Tumblr. I have no idea how I'm going to come up with 15 things, but I'll have a go. These are in no particular order, just in case you wanted to waggle a finger at me. My Family -I guess this one is pretty obvious (except if you don't have a family yet). When you get home after a long day, and your children rush up to show you what they made at schoolyou can't beat that.

The Internetwithout the internet, my life would be very small, and very boring.

Internet FriendsAnybody with a full time job, and a house full of children (we have three) will attest to there being no time left for "yourself"and therefore very little time for the "grown up" friendships you had before children. Late on an evening I escape to the internet for an hour or two, and connect with a rag-tag group of people I have come to know over the years.

BooksI love reading, even though I don't get much chance to sit and read any more. My favourite book of the last couple of years was "Ready Player One", closely followed by "Hackers".

Open Source SoftwareI've always been involved with open source software in one way or another (anybody with an iOS or Android phone is too, they just don't realise it). I love the ideals behind open source softwarethat we should all pay it forward when we build software, and release the code to the community.

Nerdy TV ShowsThere is no end to the geeky crap I will watch late at nightfrom "Betas", to "Silicon Valley", "Big Bang Theory", and most recently the amazing "Halt and Catch Fire".

ChocolateI have a Peanut M&M problem. More accurately, I have a Family Bag Peanut M&M problem. I'm not saying any more.

GadgetsI'm guessing this is fairly obvious, given that I posted a load of stuff about Raspberry Pi's to Facebook this morning and there was the Amazon Fire TV that arrived at home last week tooPizzaThe easiest, fastest, best tasting food in the known universe. I like meat pizzas best, but will eat just about any flavour pizza you put in front of me.

CyclingI ride a mountain bike to and from work every day (and have the legs to go with it as a result). I watch the track cyclists at the Olympics with absolute awe.

RunningI used to go out running a couple of times a week, and really need to get back into doing it. It was "me" time, away from everybody, with just the sounds of my feet on the pavement, and the breath in my head. Like I saidI need to get back to it.

Podcastswhile cycling to work, or commuting to client sites on trains, I listen to podcasts on my phone. Think of podcasts as "on demand radio shows". Favourites at the moment would be those made by the British Tech Network. Andy Ihnatko gets a special mention, because his "Almanac" podcast is amazing.

Notebooks & Writing -I'm a pen and paper nerd. I always have been. I have a moleskine notebook in my bag, and a filofax. I love doodling in the moleskine alongside the idiotic private journal entries I sometimes write. My favourite place to write has always been coffee shops.

BloggingI guess this one is obvious, right? I've been blogging since the early 2000s in one way or another. Sometimes I get fed up with the entire thing, but then (as some of you will know) I will re-appear a few weeks later, resurrecting myself somewhere else.

CinemaI love going to the cinema. Always haveand it doesn't really matter what the movie is. Some of my favourite childhood memories are walking out in the cold night air after the various Star Wars or Star Trek movies, and feeling like you were walking on airyour head swimming with the ideas and stories you had just seen.

I gather I am supposed to "tag" some people when I post thisI'm not sure I will, because I always fear that the same people will get tagged repeatedly, which is stupid.

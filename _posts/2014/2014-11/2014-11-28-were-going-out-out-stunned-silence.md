For the first time in what feels like a very long time (but is in reality only three weeks) we are off out for a drink and something to eat with friends this evening. Shocking behaviour.

We will leave our eldest daughter in charge, and walk all of 200 yards to the pub across the way. The pub that serves Fred Flintstone sized portions. The last time we were in there I saw a steak and ale pie delivered to a little old lady, and found myself wondering where on earth she was going to put it all.

So yes. I am writing this before we head out, on the slim chance that we get carried away and don't arrive home until the early hoursby which time I will have caused myself to fail at "NaBloPoMo" (National Blog Posting Month). There's only a couple of days to go, so I'll be damned if I'm going to fail now.

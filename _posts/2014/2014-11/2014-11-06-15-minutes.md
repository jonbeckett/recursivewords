Today was an adventure. So much so that I find myself with 15 minutes to scrape inside the daily deadline for the lunatic writing journey I'm on. How much can I write in the next few minutes? We shall see.

Our eldest daughter put us through hell this evening. I'm not going to go into any detail about what she did, what she screamed at us, or what she caused to happen. I'm just going to record that the shit flew, and we managed to pull the fan out of the way (again).

I was approved for "unlimited overtime" at work last week, and I agreed to the idea "in principal". A week on, and it's looking hilariously unlikely. Take this evening for instance - we're racing towards midnight, and I have had no time to do anything, let alone overtime. From the moment I arrived home from work the entire evening has been like a slowly unfolding car crash. The last few nights have been the same way - last night I stayed up until 2am to grab back a couple of hours doing what I wanted, but of course paid for that this morning.

Tiredness seems to have become a way of life.

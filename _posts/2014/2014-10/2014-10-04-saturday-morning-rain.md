There is a mist fallingit was forecast, and is no doubt doing it's best to destroy our lofty plans to take the telescope out tonight to look at the moon with the children.

Miss Nine is off to play football this morning with the boysjoining the local team. We need to tell our eldest's ex football coach this is happeninghe predicted it years ago, after watching her race off across the pitch at 5 years old with the ball at her feet.

She is faster than her sisters, is full of fast twitch muscles, and never gets tired (which nearly kills us sometimes).

The cats are fast asleep, crashed out all over the house. I imagine the cold, wet weather that arrived this morning has sealed their plans for the day"sleep".

Coffee. I need coffee.

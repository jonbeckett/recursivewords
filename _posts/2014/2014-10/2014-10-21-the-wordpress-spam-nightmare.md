I decided to move my blog back to WordPress at lunchtime, and unwittingly came across the spam bug in WordPresswhen you re-publish a post that has previously been published, it emails everybody following the blog AGAIN. Way to go WordPress. That's going to make sure nobody follows the blog again. Thankyou to the kind person that let me knowyou know who you are (quite how you didn't shout at me is anybody's guess).

I'm not even sure if my stay will be at all permanenthaving seen the changes WordPress seemintent on making to the authoring interface (slowly turning wordpress into a walled garden), I'm considering my options.

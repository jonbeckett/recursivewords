One of the main reasons I moved this blog to Blogger is because I'm less likely to tinker with it. Less likely to dick around with the mechanics of it. Less likely to write interminably boring posts like this one about the clever trick I found today to make some widget or other do something or other. I did figure some neat things out though - and remembered a few other neat things along the way. I'm almost laughing at myself - I've been writing online long enough that I've forgotten that some things existed - or, indeed, that some things were a "thing" at all. So yeah... uprooting myself and starting again has been a re-discovery of sorts. Going back to basics has forced me to remember how we used to do things online, before the social networks steamrollered the landscape, and turned us all into "users".

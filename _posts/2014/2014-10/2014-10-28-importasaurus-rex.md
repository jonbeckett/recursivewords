I just pulled the last 2 years worth of personal blog posts back into here. Yes, I know I said I wasn't going to, but there's something strangely comforting about having 640-odd posts looming over your back like some kind of literary mountain.

Actually, "literary" is a bit of a stretch. Kind of like calling any of my past attempts at "NaNoWriMo" an "unfinished novel".

One day I will figure out a way of importing everything back to 2003, just to see if I can break Blogger. I have everything in PDF format, but much of it is really screwed up. Ho hum.

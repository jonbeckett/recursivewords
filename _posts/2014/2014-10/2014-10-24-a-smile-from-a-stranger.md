The office where I work is in the depths of a country estate - the building is "The Old Estate Office" - and my journey to work on the mountain bike takes me through perhaps a mile of winding, tree lined estate roads en-route to the office. Over the past few weeks I have occasionally passed a woman walking a dog along my route through the estate, but hadn't really taken any notice until recently when I noticed she has moved into one of the old cottages across the way from the office.

This morning while standing half-awake in the kitchen making coffees after arriving at work, I looked up just as she left her house, her gaze met mine - and she smiled.

Yes, she's attractive, and yes, she's appears to live there on her own - and yes, I know that's going to make lots of people jump to all sorts of conclusions, but really? I was just happy that she had noticed me too - that we kind of "knew" each other, without even exchanging words.

A simple smile has so much power.

A few minutes before leaving the office this evening I was invited for a chat on the floor below. Without getting into too much detail, an offer was made to effectively allow unlimited paid overtime over the next few months on a project that is falling between the cracks. The decision is entirely mine. I'm thinking about it. Seriously thinking about it. It would mean little or no home life for the next few months, but would mean extra money throughout the Christmas period. Extra money is useful. I guess the only thing weighing on my mind is that I remember how tired I was when I freelanced in the evenings a couple of years ago. I've been offered freelance work recently and not taken it up, so wonder why I should think any differently this time. Money is a persuasive incentive.

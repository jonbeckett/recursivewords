While cycling home from work, I began thinking about all sorts of random crap - as you do - and while waiting for a line of cars at a junction to attempt to kill me, a thought popped into my head (I nearly wrote "pooped" then, and am still giggling now) - why is this blog called "Recursive Words", and what does it mean ?

I take the word "Recursive" for granted, because I'm a software developer - and you often write recursive routines because they're a good way of doing things efficiently sometimes. Here's where I get all nerdy on you...

The basic idea behind recursion is you wrote a simple function that can call itself repeatedly. A good example is a routine to tell you what is in every folder of your computer. You would write one function that takes the starting place as a parameter, and have it call the same function for every folder it finds in that place - passing that place name - and so on, and so on. One function walks the entire tree of folders. Make sense ?

So - "Recursive Words"... if you think about it, writing a blog is typically story telling - recounting the stories of your day. If I write my story, and you read it, your story may be influenced by mine - so mine has been fed into yours, and then your story becomes the influence for somebody elses story, and so on, and so on.

Yes, I know - it's a very tenuous link - it kind of works though, and that's good enough for me. We feed into each other's stories, and weave this ridiculously complex tapestry of life, relationships, conversations, experiences, hopes, dreams, and everything else inbetween.

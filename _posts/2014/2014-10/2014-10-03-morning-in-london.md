After falling out of bed, having a shower, and making breakfasts and lunches for the children yesterday morning, I slipped my suit on, and jumped on a train towards London with work for the first time in ages. I like the journey to Londonor rather, I like the time it give me "to myself". Time to read.

I read "Hackers" by Stephen Levy to pass the timea favourite non-fiction book that tells the story of the early days of modern computer historyfrom the model railroad clubat Stanford, through to the emergence of Apple and Microsoft. If you get a chance to grab a copy, do soit's fantastic.

London was it's usual selffilled with busy people. Busy going somewhere. Busy doing something. Busy being busy. I wandered along (because I arrived early) and found my destination rather too easily. I'll admit to scouting it out on Google the night before. I sat in Starbucks just around the corner (also scouted out the night before), and quietly emptied my head in the moleskine while waiting for my co-worker to arrive.

Maybe I "miss" working in London because I'm notalways there. I don't have to get up at 5:30am every day, and fall back in the door at 7pm as I did during 2007-2008 while working in the depths of the city. I miss the lunchtime walks toowandering along to the numerous small parks near Spittalfields to sit and watch the world go by while munching on sandwiches.

Perhaps I will work in London again one day, and then no doubt complain about fellow commuters, and the sea of busy, impatient, rude, and self obsessed people pouring from the trains each morning

I got home from work this evening, and while dealing with the firstsink full of washing up, beforedinner, my other half informed me that she's off to the coast with her Mum early tomorrow morning. I looked confused, and she exploded - telling me she had told me repeatedly about this. It was all news to me.

I am therefore sailing the ship single handed all weekend. Standing at the side of football training tomorrow morning, rugby training on sunday morning, and trying to avoid our eldest daughter for the entire weekend. For some reason - a mystery to all of us - she has gone nuclear, and isn't talking to any of us. For the last week she has deliberately looked for excuses to start fights, be that sitting sideways at the dinner table, eating with only a fork, or anything else you might think up. It's been going on for the last month or so - getting worse and worse. I'm going to let her get on with it this weekend.

Apart from standing around at sports grounds, I don't have a great deal to do this weekend, so will be doing all the boring rubbish that never usually gets done - washing clothes, tidying up, and perhaps even read a book!

Can you imagine? Reading a book? No doubt the noisiest kids in the street will descend on our house within seconds if I appear with a book in my hand - you can usually guarantee that kind of thing. One person in particular tends to walk straight into the house as soon as you crack the door open - I always find myself fighting the urge to immediately yell at him, but don't - because I'm "nice"...

It's a good job our thoughts are not transmitted to the outside world in some way. I can't imagine what would be going on around me half the time - probably flowers dropping and dying, or spontaneously combusting.

Anyway... it's getting late already.

Coffee. I need a coffee. And a ton of chocolate, but I don't think we have any.

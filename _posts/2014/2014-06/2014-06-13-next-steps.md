Following on with the plan to turn my involvement in "the social internet" around, and to post when I have something to say, rather than to say something, I have turned my Flickr account inside out.

For the past few years I had used Flickr to store in the region of 50,000 digital photographsa backup of every shot taken by our cameras. On top of that, I was cross-posting Instagram photos into Flickr. Instagram only generates 600600 pixel images, and mobile phone cameras are almost universallyawful.

It took a couple of evenings to remove the contents of the Flickr accounthacking away at it's contents like a mighty oak tree. Little by little the content vanished, and finally I could begin againsharing memorable photos from the archive.

Of course now the problem becomes one of choosing interesting photos to share from the countless masses. If you would like to accompany me on my journey over the coming days, weeks, and months, head on over to Flickr http://flickr.com/photos/jonbeckett.

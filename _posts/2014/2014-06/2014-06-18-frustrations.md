A pattern from my personal life seems to be repeating itself in my professional life at the moment, and I'm incredibly annoyed about it.

At home I am usually the "plodder"the guy trudging along behind everybody else, catching things, picking things up, and occasionally lifting heaven and earth on his shoulders with nobody else's knowledge to enable other people to do things. I don't mind doing it at home, because I'm a husband and fatherso tidying up, washing up, picking people up, dusting them down, paying for things, and having no time of your own kind of comes with the territory.

In recent months at work it has become more and more obvious that I am the guy with more experience than most, and I'm more likely to put up with whichever project I've been assigned todoing whatever it takes to give projects a chance of success. It would appear I'm not as savvy as some, who pick and choose what they would like to do, and rather than learn anything, they expertly sidestep any involvement. They will suddenly be busy, or not have the right skillset.

Maybe I'm the problem; I'm self reliant to the point of stupidity sometimes. If I don't know how to do something, I will invariably go and learn it (often in my own time), which is how I've ended up being able to program in so many languages, and why I seem to know so much about everything even vaguely related to programming.

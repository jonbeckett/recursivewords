I must be doing something right with this whole blogging escapadealthough that being said, I have no excuses; I have been writing online since the idea of "blogging" first gained traction about fifteen years ago. I've been "around the block" in blogging terms.

There were moments this year when I contemplated stopping. Stopping writing, blogging, sharing, interactingstopping the whole "social internet" thing. Those moments tend to happen when I'm being pulled in multiple directions at onceweighed down with external expectations and obligationsI'm slowly learning that they pass though.

I think maybe a route I can followprompted by the signup questions when I joined WordPress this time(I have been a member several times before)is to try and write once a week at least, andnot fill this space on the internet with daily brain dumps. Nobody really wants to know what you've had for breakfast, but theymightbe interested in your wider thoughts about life, the universe, and everything (and let's include blogging in that before I get shouted at for writing about writing again).

Following the mission to write something of consequence at least once a week, I have purchased Scrivener for the Macbook, and will try to organise my thoughts going forwards. Traditionally I have writtenas I am doing nowby just sitting at the keyboard, typing furiously for a few minutes, and hitting the "Publish" button. No editing, no spell checking, and no proof reading. I invariably have to return when I notice some horrific grammar or punctuation horror lurking in the shadows.

Anyway. Here's to the futurea slower and more thoughtful future.

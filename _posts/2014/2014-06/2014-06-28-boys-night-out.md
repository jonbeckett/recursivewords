A few weeks ago I received an invitation from a good friend on Facebook to do exactly what my other half has been suggesting for some timehave a "boys night out". She quite often goes out with her co-workers, or school Mums for dinner or a drinkwhich proves in some ways that women are more social than men (or maybe they are just more likely to get off their backside and organise things).

After meeting at a pub in town, we headed across the road to a Thai restaurant, and spent the evening swapping stories, eating good food, and laughing more than many of us had in some time.

It felt very strange leaving the house on my own, and several others commented on it during the evening. For several of us with families, having a night out "on our own" simply doesn't happen any moreand not because it cannot; just because it doesn't enter our head to organise it.

Of course then I walked back into the house at a little past midnight, and found a sink full of washing up to do. I guess "night off" didn't translate to everything

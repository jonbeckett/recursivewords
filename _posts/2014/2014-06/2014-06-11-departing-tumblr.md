After joining Tumblr a few months after their inception in 2007, I finally decided to shutter the account today. After spending the last 7 years posting thousands of original photos and written articles, it took minutes to deleteeverything. I cleared the account down, posted a final "goodbye" message, and removed the app from my phone.

It's like a weight has lifted from my shoulders. My argument for staying at Tumblr over the years has always been "the community"the circle of perhaps a hundred peopleI had come to know that posted invariably original contentthat treated the platform as a "blog" in the same sense that we all did in the early 2000ssharing their thoughts, opinions, and moments of their daily life.

This year it began to dawn on me that there was no real "community" as such. We were just a bunch of people pissing into the wind,thinking anybody was reading, when in reality very few were.

I guess it has been a wakeup call in some waysnot just in terms of Tumblr, but also Instagram, Flickr, and various other platforms where we all share so much content. I'm going to step back for a while, and try to clean houseI willtry to beginposting higher quality photos to Flickr, interesting thoughts to Twitter, and great meandering tomes to WordPress.

I'm going to try and make it fun again.

Having nothing to do on a Sunday morning is dangerous. You get up, have a wash, make breakfast for the kids, and then set about dismantling your online existence and re-assembling it elsewhereor at least you do if you're me. I've been here before, and no doubt I'll be here again.

For the past month or so I've been tinkering with the "Ghost" blogging platforma british built Kickstarter funded startup. I also played with the idea of connecting it to my own domain, and writing "under my real name". Without writing an essay about the pros and cons of trying anything like that, lets just say I'm not any more.

Starting all over again is fun. You get to choose a new name, a new look, a new styleyou effectively get to re-invent yourself. Of course the re-invention is temporary, because the person writing the words is the samewith the same hangups, the same thoughts, and the same idiotic ideas about the world.

Here's hoping I stick around this time. I guess the first thing to do will be find some interesting people to read, and start commenting like a lunatic (well, notactually like a lunatic, because that would imply a "leave Britney alone!" campaign of tears and histrionics). I'm actually fairly well balanced most of the timeapart from maybe when I step on a single LEGO brick in the dark.

So. Here I am again, writing one of these ridiculous "hello world" type posts that very few people will stumble upon. If you're wondering about the name of the blog, part of it came from me switching blogging platforms so often in the pastI have become a recursive routine of my own inventionwinding into myself repeatedly. I have no idea what will happen when the inevitable stack overflow happens (all the non developers just had a huge attack of narcolepsy, and now have keyboard pattern on their faces).

While writing this I'm listening to the "Weekend Wind Down" mix on Spotify. You really needed to know that, didn't you.

I guess I should shut up and go read some of your blogs.

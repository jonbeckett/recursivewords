I had to go on a long railway journey across the country today, which meant getting up at 5am this morning. I had all the intentions in the world of having an early night last night, but got sucked into one thing after another, and ended up sat in bed with the Macbook at midnight.

My own stupidity really occurred to me when setting the alarm on the phoneit does this clever trick when it tells you how far away the alarm is (which is really useful, because it avoids you setting it on the wrong daynot that I'll admit to ever having done that, honest).

The alarm said it would be going off in 4.75 hours time.

Ouch.

I'm not sure if anybody elses body clock does this to them, or if I have some kind of supernatural ability, but I woke up 15 minutes before the alarm was going to go off, and quietly leaned over and disabled it. I can't remember the last time I was woken by an alarmIalways wakeup a few minutes before the alarm is scheduled.

It's probably also worth pointing out that this isn't some kind of constant maniaif I have no alarm, I struggle to get out of bed at all, and yet on weekends I will get up early to avoid wasting the day. Of course that "early start" usually means tidying up and washing up before the house gets trashed again, but that's another subject entirely.

I'm not entirely sure how I made it to the client site and back again without falling asleep on the train on the way home, and drooling over myself spectacularly.

I have a paranoid fear of falling asleep on trains and snoring like a tractor just so you know.

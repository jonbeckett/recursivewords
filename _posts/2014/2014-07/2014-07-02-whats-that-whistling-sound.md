Oh, I know. That sound is another week whistling past. I can't believe it's Wednesday already.

I'm busy resurrecting code from a project I last worked on in 2012. Memory, inclination and enthusiasm seem to have deserted me though, so I'm writing yet another head emptying tome here instead.

The most interesting thing I have to report about this week so far (and this says a lot about how mundane my life has been recently) is that I bought a calendar refill for my old Filofax. Quite apart from carrying a 1980s stationary item around with me once again, I'm also having to ignore the fact that I could only get a mid-year diary for it, so it only becomes useful at the start of August.

I like the idea of Filofaxes. They appeal to the same idiosyncratic chunk of my brain that guides me towards the Moleskine notebooks in stationers. It's crazy reallyI have a modern smartphone in my pocket that can give me instant access to everybody I've ever known, or ever crossed paths with. The phone can also share calendars with my other half, and probably translate it all into Dutch if I really wanted it to and yet I'm carrying around paper notebooks as well.

I must be mad. Or eccentric. Probably both.

Maybe the pen and paper fascination is a reaction to spending so much of my life buried in computerseither for work, or as an escape late in the evening.

Maybe I have no idea what I'm talking about, and am just jibbering on, typing these words in because I have nothing better to do, and I'm kind of avoiding getting on with the programming mountain I'll have to climb over the next several days.

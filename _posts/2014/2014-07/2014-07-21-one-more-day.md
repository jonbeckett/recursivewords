Tomorrow will be my last day in the office for a week or so. I'm burning through the remains of this year's holiday allocation in one go (our holidays reset at the end of July).

One more day batting away customer support calls, and pre-sales requests before heading down to the south coast with my family to spend a week in a holiday camp. The younger children will turn themselves inside out while trying to catch sight of "the characters" (some poor entertainers in 7ft tall padded suits, vaguely resembling a tiger, a gorilla, an elephant, and humongous boy and girl.

It's amazing that children just accept cartoon characters in suits. They must know they're not realafter all, "Ned" and "Polly" could only be the demon spawn of Hagrid if they really were real. Quite where giant fluffy walking animals wearing beach shorts might come from is anybody's guess.

I expect my days will be spent in the pool with the children, and my evenings at the cabaretcheering on the kids as they take part in all manner of ridiculous activities led by the entertainment staff.

It's funny reallywhile many of the people we know will be off to snow capped mountains, or sun drenched foreign beaches during the holidays, we will essentially set off for a 1950s style holiday camp. Despite the aloof sneers the "keeping up with the Joneses" brigade may level at us, I suspect our children will have far more fun.

Think about itif you were nine years old would you rather have a continental breakfast in a mountain chalet with your parents, or would you rather have sausage egg and chips with a seven foot tall Tiger called "Roary"sat next to you ?(don't you dare say the continental breakfast)Our eldest will be allowed to stay up for the disco this year. No doubt I will draw the short straw of quietly sitting by the bar, feeding her fizzy drinks while she gathers the courage to hit the dancefloor in the dresses we bought last weekend.

Yesyou heard that right. I took my daughter clothes shopping at the weekend, and bought her a number of dresses. I confirmed my "Super Dad" status by buying a Superman belt for myself.

We spent the evening eating pizza, drinking wine, and catching up with good friends that live across the way. The children played video and board games together, and amused themselves all evening. We all ate enough pizza to kill a Rhino, and made two bottles of wine vanish.

After tidying loading the dishwasher, clearing up, and getting the kids to bed, the night is still young, and yet I'm dead on my feet. Again.

What happened to the guy that used to be such a night owl? What happened to staying up into the early hours chatting with friends on the internet? What happened to having any sort of life outside of the house, the family, and the children?Don't listen to me. I'm just tired.

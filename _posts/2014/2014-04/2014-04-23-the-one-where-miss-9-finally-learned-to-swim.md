Today will go down on the record as the day Miss Nine finally conquered swimming. She has been swimming (head down, torpedo like) since last summer, but has never quite got the knack of breathinguntil today.

As soon as we got in the pool I told Miss 10 that I would be spending time with her sister, and something clicked in her head straight away. She kicked away from me towards the side, rolling her body, lifting her arms clear of the water, and powered herself for a good five or six metres. She hit the side of the pool, flung herself round and bellowed "I CAN SWIM! I CAN SWIM!"The rest of the time was spent with me following her around the shallows, shouting "LONG ARMS! LONG LEGS" repeatedly, and getting her sister to demonstrate. She will get it eventually.

The neglected little girl we adopted at 2 years old that could hardly walk has come a very long way. She still has so many mountains to climb, but she never gives up.

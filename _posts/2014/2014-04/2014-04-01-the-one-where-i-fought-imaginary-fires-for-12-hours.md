In a somewhat fortuitous turn of events I chose to work from home today. Fortune favoured me not because I had the motive, and opportunity to purchase and consume an entire packet of caramel chocolate digestive biscuits (I really did!), but because it turns out I needed the fast internet connection at home.

Due to the wonders of the office being in the middle of nowhere, and consumer broadband contention being an order of magnitude better than the office, it sometimes makes sense to work from home. Today it made a LOT of sense. I obviously can't go into any great detailI can tell you that I sat down at 8:30am after saying goodbye to the rest of the family, and then didn't really get up until 8pm this evening.

I spent the entire day connected remotely to a server farm at the other end of the country, desperately trying to diagnose and work around absolute mayhem. I wonin the end. I know I pulled the project out of the fire. The client knows I pulled the project out of the fire. Hearty back-slaps all round.

There are a couple of hours of the evening left. A couple of hours to perhaps geek out watching a TV show, or a movie, or to drink endless cups of tea. Such an exciting life.

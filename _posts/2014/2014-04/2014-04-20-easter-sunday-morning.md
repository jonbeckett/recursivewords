We have been up since 7am, when our younger children awoke. The next ten minutes were spent running around the garden like idiots following a treasure trail we set last night. I'll post the video laterwe have been recording a lot of video recently, because we realised we had not done so for a couple of years. If we don't record these moments, we don't get the chance again.

I'm waiting for everybody else to finish in the bathroom before having a shower, getting dressed, and then heading off to the in-laws for lunch.

Miraculously, the children do not have chocolate poisoning just yet.

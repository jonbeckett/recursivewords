I interrupted a game of Mario Party on the Wii this morning to ask our younger children (who are on their last day off school) to get dressed. After a few minutes they trudged off upstairs, and I thought no more of it. A few minutes later I heard the bath filling, and thought "oh goodthey're having a bath" (they need to for school tomorrow anyway). I then hear an almighty crash, so go and investigate.

I discover Miss Nine sitting naked in 6 of cold bath water, that appears to be bright green. I then look across to Miss Ten who is studiously reading the instructions for a packet of Moshi Monsters Bath Goo that Miss Nine got for her birthday."This isn't going to work! The bath is full of cold water! The crystals won't dissolve!"Silence."How much did you put in?""All of it""Who's idea was it?"Miss Nine points at Miss Ten.

I spent the next half an hour tipping the half-dissolved goo down the plughole, cleaning the bath, cleaning Miss Nine, and wondering what on earth we are going to do with Miss Ten (who has been a manipulative little shit throughout much of the Easter break).

After reading various reviews of the goo on Amazon, it looks like we got away with it lightlyif the goo HAD worked, I would probably be calling a plumber out this afternoon.

I have been back in the office this weekwellsince Wednesday, when I returned after having time off at Easter. Even being back here a few days feels really, really strange. I have spent the entire year so far either commuting into London (2 hours each way on trains), or living in hotels hundreds of miles from home.

For the majority of the time I had also been doing development work with others watching mewhich (as you can guess) is FAR more stressful than working on your own. I somehow got used to it though maybe not the working in front of others, but perhaps the continual headlong rushto do this with that person, to go there and do this with that person, and so on. Washing clothes at weekends, and packing bags on Saturday to travel on Sunday eveningsIt's all come to a stop for a while, and I kind of feel like I'm at a loose end. When you've been running ragged for long enough, it becomes normal.

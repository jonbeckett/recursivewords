I walked into the office at 8:45 this morning, and basically didn't leave my seat again until 7pm this evening. Building software and configuring systems in an "agile" manner while the stakeholders sit in the room changing their mind about every facet of it is exhausting.

Everybody else left by 4pm. I left at 7pm, after quietly slogging away for the final few hours to put in place as much as I could that we had talked about. Going the extra mile.

Walking back to the hotel I had difficulty switching offmy mind spinning over everything done during the day.

Instead of heading out alone for something to eat this evening, I bought pre-packed salad from a 24 hour supermarket, and ate in it my hotel room. Such an exciting life.

The remains of the day will be spent reading a trashy book, with a large glass of red wine for company.

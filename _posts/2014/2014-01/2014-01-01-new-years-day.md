At some point yesterday eveningin spite of feeling like hell, and dosing myself up on ibuprofen every few hoursI decided "what the hell", had a wash, got changed, and prepared to head out with the rest of the family to greet the new year with friends.

As it turns out we had a wonderful eveningeating all manner of festive junk, drinking wine, and playing board games with our friends. Although usually I'm a pretty solitary kind of person, I always come away from such evenings promising I will push myself out the door more often.

We had originally planned to end the evening fairly earlywinding the clocks forward, and telling the children that midnight was in fact 10pmbut somewhere along the way that plan got thrown out of the window, and before we knew it, we almost missed the chimes of Big Ben.

We finally got home at about half past midnight, and tipped several tired, cranky children into bed. I'm not entirely sure how my voice made it through the night, and wasn't surprised at all when I couldn't swallow, or speak when I woke up this morning. A couple more ibuprofen, and lots of tea this morning seem to have worked wonders.

Anyway I can hear clattering in the kitchen. I better go help make lunch before I get ranted at.

Happy New Year!

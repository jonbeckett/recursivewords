Given that today was the first day back in the office after a couple of weeks away to gorge on food, and drink ourselves into oblivion, it hasn't been too bad at all. A couple of meetings, some buggy code, a few awful cups of coffee, and a curtailed walk at lunchtime due to the greater part of England vanishing underwater.

Of course I didn't really get to gorge on that much food over the festive period, because we live with three small female germ factories that made sure they incapacitated the adults in the house as soon as they finished school for the year.

I'm in two minds about the upcoming project at workwhile I'm not really looking forward to the early mornings and late evenings, I am kind of looking forward to working somewhere new, and making new friends. I'm also looking forward to the hours spent on the train each daya strange thing to look forward to, I knowbecause I will be afforded the time to read and write more than I have in years.

I'm looking forward to exploring an area of London I've not really spent much time around beforewalking the streets, sitting in cafes, and watching the world go by.

Before all of that can happen, I need to get everything in orderoyster card for the underground, credit card for the mainline train journeys, and identity documents to aid in the creation of my "Flynn" level user accounts in order to take the fight to the master control program (and yes, that was a very nerdy joke indeed).

If you're reading this, and you work anywhere near Victoria in central London, maybe we can meet up for coffee at some point? Swap horror stories about commuting, watch the world go by, and invent fictional life stories for strangers that wander past.

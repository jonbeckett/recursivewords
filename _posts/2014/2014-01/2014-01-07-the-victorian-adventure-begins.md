Tomorrow morning I will fall out of bed at 6am, get dressed, have a wash, and wander back along the same paths I walked for two years to the train station, headed for London. Clothes are hanging in the study, shoes are polished, my old messenger bag is filled with laptop, charger, and mouse, and the Kindle is on charge on the desk. The credit card is at zero, the oyster card is charged with money, and the tablet will spend the night on charge. I think I'm ready.

In some ways it feels like getting back on a familiar bikepreparing work clothes for the week ahead, and switching bags from the battered backpack that normally accompanies me to and from the office. The messenger bag is easier to carry on the underground, and probably safer because I can keep an eye on itit also doubles as a huge rest for whichever book I'm reading.

I'm looking forward to the morninglooking forward to meeting a new team, starting a new project, but most of all exploring a part of London I have never spent time in and around before. The first few lunchtimes will be spent walking the nearby streets and getting my bearingsfiguring out the best parks, best sandwich places, and best cafes. With a little luck I'll find somewhere quiet, and get to know the staff.

While working in London I will also try and seek out some fellow bloggers. I have often noticed various meetups happening in New York through the Tumblr community, and have been a little enviousI don't usually live or work in the city, so the chance to meet anybody from the blogosphere is remarkably remote.

Anyway it's getting late (he says, before spending the next hour reading random blogs, and posting comments and likes here, there, and everywhere).

While the rest of the household scraped themselves out of bed this morning, I headed for the local rugby club with our middle girl for her final training session of the year. An email had done the rounds a few days before asking us to wear running shoes if we wanted to take part in the annual "parents versus children" event.

After running the children through a number of training exercises (god knows who, given that they won't be playing until the autumn), the call went out for a parents team."Ground ruleschildren can tackle parentsparents can only tag children"The cheer that went up from the children was thunderous. What transpired for the next hour was children throwing themselves at the well drilled line of parents like hail. Any semblance of passing the ball went out of the window as they repeatedly crashed into uswave after waveand got nowhere. From time to time the parents got the ball, and we waded forwards like a line of Godzillas, lumbering through a seething swarm of little people.

While being enveloped at one point, I felt a hand beneath my foot, and instinctively rolled my foottaking my entire unbalanced weight on the side of my ankle. Getting up, I checked the kid I had stood on, and he was finedespite having my foot print embossed on his forearm and hand.I've turned my ankle beforeand knew that I would pay for it later. It didn't stop me completing the session, walking into town to visit the French market, and completing the obligatory weekend chore of stumbling home laden with with half a ton of groceries.

As confidently predicted, I am paying for the twisted ankle nowit's 1am, and I'm still sitting on the couch, keeping weight off it. Of course this weekend I was supposed to have cut the grass tooyou can imagine how well that has gone down (the rot set in on preparing dinner, which I couldn't do eitherat least the kids loaded the dishwasher).

Roll on Tuesday, and discovery of how quickly my body heals itself. With no working bike, walking six miles on a twisted ankle might not be the best idea in the world.

Nothing of consequence seems to have happened over the last few daysbut I'm not about to let that stop me from writing endlessly about it.

I still haven't got my bike fixed. It's now a week since the crank snapped, and it's still sitting in the back garden. I predicted this was going to happenjokingly stating "it will be three weeks before I get a chance to take it to the bike shop". Being honest, if I had remembered to call the bike shop, I could have taken it in this week, but work, life, and everything else landed on me like a proverbial ton of bricks, and well I didn't call the bike shop.

Not being on the bikeand having sat on trains for much of the year so far, commuting to distant client siteshas started to have an affect on my legs. The huge muscles that used to power the bike pedals are not so huge. It's not noticeable yet, but I'm noticing that some of the bulk has gone. I really need to get the bike fixed, or start running again.

While walking to and from the office this week I have been listening to Podcasts. I've pretty much come to the conclusion (and I know that this flies in the face of popular opinion) that the TWiT podcastsnot hosted by Leo Laporte are better than those involving him. He owns the show, and gets away with behaviour that none of the co-hosts would ever be allowedit's not all the time, but the occasional sexist, misogynistic, or racist comments give you pause for thought. I think maybe it's a generational thingRon Atkinson (famous soccer manager in the UK) fell foul of it after using racist language on live TV over here (while he thought he was off air), and never worked again.

Luckily I have discovered the "5by5" network, where the personalities are smallermeaning the content is king. It makes a huge difference. Because they are more of a start-up they are willing to try things out tooconstantly trying new shows, and constantly re-inventing. I guess they are disrupting the status quo in the way startups always have.

I need to think about leaving. Our youngest daughters are dancing in a show at the local school theatre this eveningI have tickets for the first show. If I'm late I'll be in the dog house for a week.

After spending months chasing my own tale, this weekend I had the chance to kick back and catch up with the internetand was dismayed (although not surprised) to see that NBC have finally cancelled the TV show "Community".

Community was always something of a secret among the people that watched itwe all knew it was the most original, anarchic, and funniest comedy on television, and we all knew that the secret should be maintainedwhich is probably why it got cancelled.

We are all quietly hoping that the show will be taken up by Netflix to reach it's hastag goal of "six seasons and a movie"oft repeated quietly in the background of the show by Abed.

If you ever heard somebody complain that something has been "Britta'd", you ever hear a "Winger speech", or somebody randomly starts reciting dialogue from an 80s movie, you will have Community to thank for it.

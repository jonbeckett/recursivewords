Do you ever have days when you get up, go through the motions of going to work, but your entire head is elsewhere?This morning I made bacon rolls for everybody for breakfast, and packed lunches for everybody before anybody even came downstairs. When they did finally arrive I was making everybody a cup of tea (which I only drank half of) before heading out the door.

I keep wondering about getting up at 6am each day, instead of 7at least then I would get some time to myself (actually, I bet I would just end up chasing the kids even more).

In other news, "We The Users" (http://wetheusers.net [http://wetheusers.net/]) is improving slowly. I spent lunchtime today fixing a few bugbears with itthe CSS for mobile and tablets is now much better than it was.

I have been tinkering withwetheusers.netover the last few daysfixing bugs, and polishing rough edges. If you have no idea what I'm talking about, "We The Users" is a prototype social blogging platform that I builtkind of a mashup of Twitter and Tumblr.

I guess points to focus on would be; Posts usemarkdownsyntaxYou can postsomepostsfriends only You cancomment, andreply to commentsYou canprivate messageeach otherand read the thread of messages (yep, looking at you again Tumblr!). You canchatin real time with one another You can add yourself to adirectory of usersto make yourself discoverable. You can browse thefirehoseof everybody's content really easily Themobile interfaceis beautiful on phones and tablets You can choose to have as many, or as few events wired up to sendemail notificationsas you wantand still not miss notifications even if you switch email notifications offthe site records them for you anyway to go catch up when you have a chance.

I really need people to go register, post, try things out, and give feedback.

Any volunteers ?

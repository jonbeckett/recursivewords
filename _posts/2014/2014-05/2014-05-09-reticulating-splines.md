It's lunchtime right now, so I guess I can arguably spend some time "watching the world go by"but seeing as I'm on the first floor, looking out of the window only provides a view of the roof the building opposite. Hardly "of interest".

I started watching "The Social Network" with our eldest daughter last night, and saw Mark Zuckerberg using LiveJournal. I remember watching the movie in the cinema when it first came out, and wondering if there would be a spike of interest in it again. I just signed up with it last week to have a play, and am keeping everything "friends only" for the moment. It's kind of interesting to see where the whole blogging thing came from, because LiveJournal hasn't really changed in the last 10 years at all.

I've been looking back through the people I used to keep in touch with via KIK (instant messaging app) on my phone this lunchtime. Back in the day, most of the people I knew on Tumblr used KIK as their "go to" instant messaging appthose days seem to have ended (which I guess is also reflected in that I only really keep in touch with one or two people via IM any more anyway).

Anyway IT'S FRIDAY!Busy counting the hours down towards the weekend, when in reality I know this weekend is going to be filled with all manner of obligations, chores, and such like. I'll end up looking forward to returning to work on Monday.

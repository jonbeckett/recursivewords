It's Sunday Morning, and I'm wondering what the day will bring. Our middle girl has gone to a rugby match, and our youngest is barraging me with requests to visit the playpark in town.

For the first time in recent memory I have had a chance to relax this weekendto switch off. I'm not washing and ironing clothes on Sunday morning to pack in a bagI'm not leaving mid-afternoon to catch a train.

The constant travel, deadlines, hotels, and stress are slowly unravelling me. Thoughts about the futureabout changehave been rolling around my head for the first time in years.

When you set out to become a software or web developer, you don't consider the travel. You don't think about days spent on trains to distant destinations, or nights spent in hotels on your own. You think about the codethe problemsthe solutions. You don't think about "getting it done by Friday at all costs"you think about the most elegant way to do it.

I guess at some point this might turn into a more considered post about the realities of software and web developmentabout the commercial versus the open source world (I have had a foot in both camps for years)about building to a deadline and a budget, versus building to an ideal.

Anywaytime to take a certain young lady to the playpark. Time to be a Dad.

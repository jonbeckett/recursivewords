I'm going to start a new movement on the internet. It's not going to be anything big, grand, or visionary. It's going to be about not doing thingsnot trying too hard, not trying to fit in, not conforming, not doing what people say.

It's going to be called "Unblogging".

I'm fed up of all the SEO experts, the "professional" bloggers, and the niche nutcases. I want to get back to people writing about their daily life, and just emptying their head. Honesty, bravery, brevity, and candid thoughts. I fell into the hipster blogging vortex myself for quite some timeworrying about the quality of photos, having something interesting to say, being creative, original, and unique.

It's all rubbish.

People want to know each other. The words and pictures are really just a conduit. The more finely crafted they are, the more you know they are bullshit. Finely crafted bullshit, but bullshit none the less.

It's the "Finding Forrester" maxim, isn't itdon't thinkjust write. Thinking comes later (or in our case, after hitting publish).

So there you have it. Unblogging. Get to it.

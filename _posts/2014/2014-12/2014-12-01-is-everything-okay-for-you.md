After work this evening I wandered down to the hotel lobby and bought a drinkhalf celebrating a successful day (for a change). I figured sitting on my own in the lobby was marginably better than sitting on my own in my roomor at least it was for about half an hour.

For almost the entire time I sat with a drink and my phoneposting nonsensical photos to Instagrama long limbed girl had been deep in conversation with the hotel staff about some kind of block room booking. Looking back, the clue was the ankle warmers.

Twenty minutes afterwards a blonde girl skipped in breathlessly, and asked the tall girl if they were in the right place. She nodded."I'll go and tell the rest of the company then".

It didn't take long to figure out what kind of company they were. Within minutes the lobby was festooned with costume bags, hard cases, and quite the most colourful collection of people I have seen in quite some time. Only I have seen people like it beforebecause our girls attend dance classes. They were dancers, and actors, and technicians, and directors, and choreographers, and makeup artists, and everybody else you might associate with a production of some kind.

The girls were almost universally tall, with long pony-tails, and stunningly pretty. The men seemed to be either blessed with chiselled faces, or sported manicured goatees. You could spot the engineers and makeup artists from a mile awaythey were built far more heavily than the rest.

I finished my drink while absorbed in their appearances, and quietly escaped to the pizza restaurant around the corner.

You're probably wondering where the title of this post comes into the storyand this would be it.

Having just stuffed a rather large chunk of an "American Hot" pizza into my face hole, the really quite lovely girl waiting tables chose to approach me."Is everything okay for you?"Quite apart from being able to do nothing but grin like a stupidly happy hamster at her, it suddenly occurred to me that her question was wrongas in Sheldon Cooper Wrong. What did she really mean by "everything" ?surely she was only referring to the food. I started grinning. Supressing a giggle. I so wanted to create a typical Sheldon scene in the restaurant, but of course I didn't have the nerve. I doubt she would have found it funny either. Not as funny as me anyway.

Why is that we always think of funny things to say after an event has passed?

There's something about blogging. When I say that, I'm not talking about the niche lunatics recycling content through their fashion, food, or travel blogsI'm talking about those of us who empty our head into the keyboard every few days. We share snapshots of daily lifeour memories, thoughts, dreams, hopes, and ideasand invite the unknown passing crowd to know us perhaps better than those that surround us in the "real world".

There is something about writing, and reading words that have not been professionally editedthat may have been written in the heat of the moment. Blog posts are not always subject to the filters we might use if writing an essay, or preparing a speech. We switch on the computer, place our hands on the keyboard, and the thoughts begin to flowsometimes like a dripping tapsometimes like a fire hydrant.

I am always in search of people telling their storythere is value in the honest, candid posts that normal people write in the dead of night, recording their inner-most thoughts about the situation they find themselves in. There is value in sharing the facets of ourselves that normally remain either carefully hidden, or undiscovered through the indifference of those that "know" us.

I think perhaps as you grow older and your career and children eat into what laughable "free" time you once had, it's easy to become lost in everybody else's lifeto lose the part of yourself that is "you" while running here for this person, or there for that person. Having a personal blog is kind of like building an escape. A place to go during the rare quiet moments to remind yourself who you are, and to find like minded people walking similar paths.

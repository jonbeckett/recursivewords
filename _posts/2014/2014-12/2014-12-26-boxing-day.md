I had visions of spending the greater part of Boxing Day playing board games with the children, and watching rubbish television shows.

Instead I spent 5 hours this morning installing Windows updates on three laptops, and removing the many and varied pieces of crapware from them to restore them back to something near the factory version of Microsoft Windows. I think perhaps the most impressive piece of idiocy was a pre-installed copy of McAfee anti-virus. Windows 8.1 comes with built-in antivirus softwarewhich had been disabled.

I also removed the "free" version of Microsoft Office (har har)where you click the icon, and it invites you to try it for a month, or pay for it now.

One huge pay-off of the kids having the laptops is that I finally get my Chromebook back from our eldest daughter. I gave it to her so she hadsomethingto use for homework last yearnow she has her own laptop, I can use it once more.

In other news, meet Supermanmy new key ring / torch type thing. The kids gave me it for Christmas. It rules.

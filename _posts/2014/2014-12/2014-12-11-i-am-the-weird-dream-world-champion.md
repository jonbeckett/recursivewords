I had a dream last night, and in the dream I recalled living somewhere previously. Here's the weird thingI dreamed about living there before. A long time ago. So let's get this straightin one dream I remembered something that happened in another dream. How on earth can that happen? I'm starting to wonder if my brain is coming apart at the seams.

The place I had lived before (in the dream) was one of the old air force quarters in the town I grew up. I knew several people that lived in them over the years, but never in the area that appeared in the dream. The dream revolved around not living there long because there was something wrong with the placeI seem to remember the carpets and bed being damp.

So yeahin the dream last night, I remembered living there again. I'm half tempted to find out if the property ever existed in the real world. The only problem with that is the only clear memory I have from the dream is of the inside of the property, and a very vague recollection of the approach to the front doornot of the street it was in.

Dreams are weird.

In half an hour or so we are all heading out for the annual office Christmas lunch. The office seems to be filled with people we haven't seen in agesmany of the staff work "on the road" for much of the year. Everybody is mysteriously happy at the prospect of a free lunchcan't imagine why.

We are headed to the Bull & Butcher in Turvillethe village where the movie Chitty Chitty Bang Bang was filmed. I'll take a photo of the windmill if I get a chance. If I start humming "Truly Scrumptious", and you end up humming it all day, it's not my fault (he says, running for cover).

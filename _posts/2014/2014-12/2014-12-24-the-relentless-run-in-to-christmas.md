I'm not quite sure why or how, but the run-in to Christmas this year has seemed relentless. I had visions of finishing work last Friday, and having a few quiet days and eveningsrelaxing into it. That's not quite how it's worked. Every day has involved another trip out to get something or other, and every evening has involved a trip out to somewhere either to see something as a family, or to show our faces at something we have been invited to. It sounds disingenuous to complain, but reallyI'm ready for some down-time now.

The reality of Christmas is that "down-time" won't really happen until Boxing Daywe will head out immediately after breakfast on Christmas Day (after getting up at some ungodly hour) for my in-laws house to spend the day with them. Following that we'll be washing and ironing clothes to travel down to the coast to visit my parents. At least while we're there wecan't go anywhere, or do anything (although no doubt we will).

I am on-call today for workwhich can go either of two wayseither something horrendous will go wrong on a customer site and I'll have to drop everything, or I just live in fear of the phone and email throughout the day. So far the phone has remained mostly quietit chirped an hour ago. I was filled with dread as I swiped my finger across the screen, but it was just the reception lady in the office leaving at lunchtime, emailing all the staff to wish them a happy Christmas.

Fingers crossed the phone remains silent for the remainder of the day.

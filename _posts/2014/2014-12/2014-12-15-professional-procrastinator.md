If there is ever an olympic event for getting nothing done, I'm pretty sure I could be a contender. It's not that I don't want to get something doneit's just that there are fare more interesting other things that I would rather be doing than the thing I'm supposed to be doing. Granted, I didn't realise just how interesting those other things were going to be until I needed to be doing something else, but that's besides the point.

Take this post for instance. I'm not supposed to be writing it, and it's not really about anything. If you've read it this far, I'm surprised. Proper "eyebrows raised" surprised. I used to think that obsessing over pointless things was a male traitit explains all sorts of stupid sports like pool, snooker, and chessbut then most of the bloggers are female. Maybe that's an attention thing. Actually, that doesn't work either, because why would anybody post anything in public if they didn't want to invite at least some attention to their crazed jabbering.

I think I'll go make a coffee, and watch the kettle boil.

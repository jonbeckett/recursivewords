Last night I noticed a post from WordPress in the dashboard that scrolls towards oblivion (and causes me to get nothing done)a post announcing the availability of the "Twenty Fifteen" theme. If you're looking at this blog from the public-facing side, you're already seeing the new theme.

I think I like it. After reading all the crap the professional bloggers espouse about the garbage you should put in a blog sidebar, and the various widgets that are a "good idea", this theme is something of a departure. It has some clever social icons in the sidebar that were a bit of a mystery to configure, but beyond thatit really dissuades you from including any extraneous content. Which is good. Probably.

I'm going to try and live with it for a while. Let me know what you think.

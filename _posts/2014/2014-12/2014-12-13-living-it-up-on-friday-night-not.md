In television shows people always seem to have time to meet-up with friends at a local bar on their way home from work on a Friday night, catch up with each other, laugh, tell stories, and generally look like they don't have to be anywhere else. Ok. Maybe I just described the scene that tended to happen in every single episode of "Friends" (or at least, every episode I ever remember seeing).

Let's compare and contrast the adventures of Monica, Chandler, Ross, Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe with my Friday night. You knowjust to see how uncannily similar they are.

Left work in the dark at 5:30pm, cycled into town through the rain, and was nearly taken out by yet another monster truck. While picking my way through the traffic with a podcast in my ears, my phone rings, so I get off the road, and miss the call. I call back, and shout "HELLO?" ten times into the phone while our middle daughter shouts "HELLO?" back. Eventually we begin hearing each other while I continue to stand astride my mountain bike in the pouring rain at the side of the road. It transpires my other half was going to buy pizza for dinner, but has left her money at home. Can I go back to the supermarket? (I'm five minutes from home)."We'll get Dominos".

I get home, and start washing up while my bike helmet is still on. They wander in the door while I'm crashing and bashing around in the kitchen, and the kids immediately start repeating "I'm hungry" until somebody listens (nobody does). We eventually order Dominos, and then regret it because of course it's Friday night, it's raining, it's cold, so half the town has also ordered Dominos. My other half has just started ranting about the order taking half the night to turn up when there is a ring at the doorbell. After ranting more en-route to the door, she opens it and is sweetness and light to the delivery driver.

After eating everybody else sods off, and I'm left with all the plates, pizza boxes, and glasses to clear up.

See. Just like Friends, isn't it.

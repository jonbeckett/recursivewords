I have one more day left at work before two weeks of leave for Christmas. I will arrive at 9am, work diligently through until 5:30pm, and then exit the building faster than Elvis on a skateboard. I will cycle home on the trusty mountain bike, lock it in the shed, and then not retrieve it again until the 6th January.

Years agobefore childrenI would always work through Christmas, and only take the mandatory days off. I was asked about it once or twice, and always replied "I'm singlewhat else am I going to do? Sit at home and play video games?". I was earning money, and saving the vacation daysnot that I ever used the vacation days.

Since Children arrived in our lives everything has turned upside down and inside out. I suddenly value every chance I get to spend time either with them, or just "switched off"sitting at home, watching a movie, and doing nothing. I think you only really appreciate "doing nothing" after a prolonged period of having no time to sit and do nothing. The simple pleasures, such as watching a movie, or reading a book become more valuable.

Of coursewhen you do get the chance to do nothing, you feel guilty about not doing something.

If the chance presents itself over the next couple of weeks, there are a few books I would love to get around to reading. I still have "The Perks of Being a Wallflower" down the side of the bed. I read the first few chapters and haven't returned to it yet. No doubt a book or two will arrive from Father Christmas too we shall see.

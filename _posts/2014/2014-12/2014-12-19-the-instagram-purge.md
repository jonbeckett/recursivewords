It was like a million teenagers voices screamed out, and were suddenly silenced. Please excuse me for quoting Obiwan Kenobi, but this has to be the most entertaining thing that has happened on the internet in quite some time.

Overnight, Instagram deleted several million accounts created by, and operated by robots. Suddenly hipsters all over the world are complaining, bitching, and moaning that the number of "followers" they have has decreased significantly. If they hadn't tried to game the system in the first place, they would have nothing to complain about.

I find it hilarious that the "entitled generation", as I will label them, put so much stock in appearances. They often still live with their parents, or receive huge handouts on a regular basis, and work incredibly hard at "appearing" to be young, successful, opulent, fashionable, intelligent, and popular. They wear clothes with specific labels, carry books they have never read, and meet friends for coffee for no other reason than to be seen.

I guess the recent queen of the attention seekers influences is Kim Kardashian, who saw the Fappening photos doing the rounds on the internet, and realised she wasn't involvedso leaked her own nude photos. The narcissist idiots buying Twitter and Instagram followers are pretty much doing the same thingbuying notoriety instead of earning it. They have lived no lifethey have no story to telland they want people to know who they are, despite the fact that there is really nothing worth knowing about them (apart, perhaps, from knowing that you would rather avoid them).

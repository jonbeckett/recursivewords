Over the last few days I've been finding it somewhat easier to write regularlyI suspect fueled by participation in NaBloPoMo, which I guess has forced the formation of a daily posting habit. In recent months I would often find myself in situations during the day, and think "oh, this is blogworthy", and would never get around to writing about them. Writing every day forced me to mentally store away the more noteable moments (I was going to write "asshats", but I don't always write about the idiots I have encountered along my way).

The interesting thingif it is interestingis that people have started reading the rubbish I write. It's almost like I've walked into a blogging time machine, and rewound the clock ten years. Years agobefore blogging became the polished pursuit of an army of moronic marketers, blogging was almost exclusively the domain of those sharing candid moments of their lives. Somewhere along the way it all became "professional". Then of course the social networks arrived, and the world and it's dog began sharing single sentences about their dinner, their itchy foot, and their annoying next door neighbour.

Where am I going with this? Certainly not where I intended to.

Ah yes. I bought the domain name for this blog. If the machinery of the internet has already done it's job, you can visit recursivewords.com, and it should present my rather ordinary writing to you. This kind of links into the whole professional blogging rant above, because I worried that attaching a domain name to the blog is bordering on "branding", and that leads to all sorts of spit, polish, and hard work that I'm not willing to invest in. There is going to be no great evolution going on here.

So why did I buy the domain name? To stop anybody else having it.

It really was that simple. The more I thought about the domain name that WordPress helpfully informed me was "available", the more I thought "yeah, available for some ass-clown to go buy on purpose". So I bought it to prevent anybody else buying it.

Now of course I'm panickingthinking that if I have the domain name, I need to make the blog presentable. Spit and polish. It's the beginning of the slippery slope, isn't itbefore you know it I'll have Google ads splashed all over the margins, and excerpts forcing several clicks to read anything (yeahwe know exactly why people do thatnothing to do with click stats at allsarcasm intended).

Worry not, dear reader. This blog will remain refreshingly candid, honest, random, and illegiblemainly because I cannot be bothered with all the marketing stupidity that so many seem to get wrapped up in. There will be no product reviews, no guest bloggers, and no pop-up ads. It will just be me, pontificating on the mundane on an almost daily basis.

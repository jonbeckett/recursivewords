We finally watched the second Hunger Games movie last night. I haven't read the books yet (despite repeated requests that I do so from a good friend). I'm not sure what to make of it.

Yes, it's exciting, and yes, it's entertaining, but it's also pretty predictable. There are plot holes all over the place too (like Katniss' never-ending quiver of arrows). One scene was laughably ridiculouswhere they fight off a flangeof baboons (Not the Nine O'clock News reference there), resulting in her running entirely out of arrows. Five seconds later they tumblr onto a beach, and she magically has a quiver full of arrows again.

It kind of ruined it for me.

There were some great moments thoughsuch as the arrow conducting the lightning, and the unmasking of the rebellion towards the end.

Of course after the movie finished I wandered off to Wikipedia to read the plot for the final movie. It seems a bit disjointedthat her sister dies,after all the importancein the earlier parts of the story to protect her.

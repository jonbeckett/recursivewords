Flying in the face of the long, wordy posts I have shared recently, I thought it might make a change to share a photo taken during my journey to work. I ride a mountain bike to the office - three miles each way - come rain or shine. Sometimes the journey is awful - picking my way through endless traffic, fighting head-winds, or splashing through puddles and driving rain. Sometimes the journey is wonderful. Today it was wonderful.

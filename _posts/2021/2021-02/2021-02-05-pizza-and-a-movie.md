I started the week wondering if I would have anything to do - exploring a research and development project, but not having anything concrete to get on with. The entire world seems to be on a go-slow at the moment. I can't imagine what it's going to be like when the world finally wakes from this impenetrable fog. Slowly but surely as the week progressed work appeared. It's funny how the cogs of the universe work sometimes.

We ordered pizza from a nearby pub that has been delivering during lockdown, and watched a movie tonight. It was a celebration of sorts - the girls came to live with us 13 years ago today. I announced our plans for dinner earlier in the evening, and a cheer rang out throughout the house.

We watched "The Greatest Showman" - the Huge Ackman movie (sorry - Night at the Museum joke). I've never been a huge fan of the movie, but will admit to getting sucked into it. I've seen it twice now - both times I sat down without really wanting to watch it, and ending up being quite affected.

I've been drinking. We ordered a "deal" from the pub - several pizzas, garlic bread, and a bottle of Prosecco. Two glasses - that's how much it takes these days to make me as giddy as a schoolboy (or a cheap date, depending on how grown up you want your frame of reference).

It's supposed to snow here all day on Sunday - but before that, we're getting our twenty ninth year of rain. I imagine we'll be clearing snow from the escape raft I've been planning on building. Seriously though - it rained all day *again*, and is supposed to rain all day tomorrow too. You would think the weather man would be bored of making all the rain by now.

Anyway. Enough nonsense. I have lots more nothing to be getting on with.

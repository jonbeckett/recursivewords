It's been a strange sort of day - and it isn't over yet.

After a very strange dream that I can't remember a lot about any more I slid out of bed at about 8am, had a shower, shave, brushed my teeth, got dressed, and wandered into the junk room to begin work. On Tuesday mornings we have an "all hands that can make it" video call - just to say hi to each other - to combat sitting alone at home for hours on end.

I made a comment about perhaps taking a few days off this week (it's half term), and spending time with my daughters. Within a couple of hours of the call a holiday request had gone in - and by this afternoon had been approved. It kind of makes sense - there are projects afoot at work, and when they begin the chance for time off will vanish - much as it did for the last year, leading to the mountain of untaken holiday still sitting there.

It's still raining. By my reckoning, apart from a brief bit of sunshine on Saturday morning, it's rained pretty consistently for the last twenty years. I should really see about building a boat out of what's left of the shed. I checked the weather forecast earlier - there's a 60% chance of rain all-day every-day throughout the week.

It's "pancake day" in the UK today. I'm not sure if the kids have found out yet. If they do, one or other of us will find themselves standing in the kitchen for an hour later, pouring batter into a frying pan, trying to look like we know what we're doing.

I wonder who invented pancake day? I wonder if it has something to do with an overrun of milk somewhere, and a crafty scheme to get lots of people to use theirs up ?

In other news, a lot of people have started following my blog at Wordpress just recently - 99% of them marketers and business owners. They follow, never read, and never comment. I wonder what they think they achieve when they follow blogs? According to the stats, across Tumblr and Wordpress I have several thousand followers. In reality, I have about twenty regular readers, and of those, only two or three interact in any meaningful way.

It's lies, damn lies, and statistics.

I read a post by somebody I know fairly well on Tumblr recently about being dropped and blocked by friends online. I used to really take it to heart when people either unfollowed or blocked me, but have slowly hardened up over the years. I suppose I came to realise that somebody falling off the radar is rarely about those they follow. I miss a lot of people who don't post any more - more than they know. I sometimes wonder about reaching out, but then talk myself out of doing so just as quickly.

Anyway.

I think I might need to go and find the packet of cheap chocolate biscuits, and put the kettle on. For reasons.

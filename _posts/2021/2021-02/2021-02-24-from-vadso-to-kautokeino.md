This evening I distracted myself with a flight in the simulator - accompanied by my middle daughter - along with a group of similar escapists. We flew from Vadso, northern Norway, along the coast, and then on to Kautokeino - a remote airstrip in the middle of nowhere. The photo accompanying this post was taken during the second-to-last leg, after departing Hasvik. My word, the northern stretches of Norway are desolate.

Back in the real world, most of the day seemed to be about running around in circles. It feels like everybody is trying to turn over the engine of the world, and bring it back to life. Unfortunately they're not entirely sure how to do so, and don't quite know where they might be going if they succeed.

I started the day writing tasks in the bullet journal, flirted with Microsoft To Do, then scuttled back again. There's something about a paper journal when you're on a call. For some reason I can listen and write at the same time - I can't listen and type.

A major project starts tomorrow. I imagine it will start somewhat slowly, but it's interesting to be around at "ground zero" - to hear the user stories, to understand the problem, and start working towards solutions.

Anyway.

It's late again. I've finally started reading "Ready Player Two", so should perhaps turn in for the night, and read a few pages.

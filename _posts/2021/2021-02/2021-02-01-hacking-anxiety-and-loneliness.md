I'm not working today, so have spent much of the day juggling home school assistance with efforts to encourage my eldest daughter to step outside her self imposed seclusion. She arrived in the lounge late last night on something of a downer, so we spent an hour firing ideas at her like a machine gun.

Long story short - she has a blog again, and has been dipping a toe into online chat rooms (or rather, lurking in online chat rooms, petrified of taking herself off mute).

She's currently sitting at her computer, trying to write a first blog post. It's painful watching her - I had to walk away. It's interesting how some people (read: me) can empty our head into the keyboard and magic a thousand words of nonsense almost at will - and some find the extraction of each and every word tortuous. Anxiety doesn't help.

I think she's planning on writing about her struggles with anxiety, lock down, and life in general. I helped get her setup with the blog, and write the about page - the first "real" post could take some time. If you have a minute today, go visit [Daisiella](https://daisiella.wordpress.com), and click follow - getting some immediate feedback will hopefully help her see that there *is* a world out there, and get her over the start line.

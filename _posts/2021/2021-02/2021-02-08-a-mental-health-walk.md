I walked into town after lunch with two of my daughters - a "mental health walk" - an escape from the walls that have been our prisoner for several weeks. It was good to get out of the house, if only for an hour.

We walked to the big park in town - mostly curious to take a look at the river that burst it's banks last week. It's receding now, but that hasn't stopped the ducks and swans from taking ownership of a huge swathe of the riverbank. I quietly walked up to some of the swans, who showed no fear at all - walking slowly towards me as I approached. My eldest daughter backed away, making worried noises - she had a run in with a swan a few years ago while trying to take a picture of it.

The park was mostly quiet - predictable, given that it was a weekday - but also because it was so cold. After leaving the house snow began falling, and got heavier during the time we were out - beginning to settle on the ground. By the time we got home my face had become numb.

It was good to get out though. The cold weather seemed to remove the idiots that think the Corona Virus doesn't apply to them. It's strange how some people are more fearful of the cold than a deadly pandemic.

I found myself in an online debate of sorts with a particular kind of idiot last night, and something occurred to me. The people that complain about political bias, unfair reporting, and support conspiracy theories tend to do so because they have actively chosen to narrow the opinions they take notice of to those they agree with. It's helped along by the very same algorithmic timeline they also complain about - because they fear missing out on anything. Figure that out - they fear missing out on the very same stories they don't want to see.

Anyway.

It's getting late, and I have a meeting first thing tomorrow. I need to sleep.

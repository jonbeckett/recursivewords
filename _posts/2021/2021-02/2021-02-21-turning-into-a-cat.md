I think I'm turning into a cat. You know how cats have favourite places to curl up or "be" that last for a few days at a time, before they move on to somewhere else? I'm like that with writing. For a while I was writing at Evernote, then a text editor for a little while, then Notion, and now I'm back at Google Docs, where I've been writing on-and-off for years.

Google Docs is the easy option for me. It satisfies the paranoid part of my brain that says "what if the computer goes bang in the middle of your Pulitzer prize winning blog post?" - because it saves every word as I write it. Of course this is predicated on the idea that what I'm writing has literary value (I'm humble enough to realise that I'm only a legend in my own lunchtime).

It's Sunday morning. The clock is just ticking past 10am. I've been up for the last hour - emptying the dishwasher, clearing the kitchen up - the usual chores around the house. I didn't have a shower this morning, and now feel grubby. I usually have a shower every morning - it helps wake me up. I'm not going anywhere or doing anything today, so thought "what's the point?" - it's not like I smell or anything. I will admit to washing my face with soap and cold water after brushing my teeth though - to try and wake myself up. It sort of worked.

I need to head out to the corner shop soon - we've run out of bread. It's kind of difficult to make toast without bread - almost as bad as the time our middle daughter made a cup of tea for her Mum after we ran out of teabags. She didn't let the lack of tea stop her - proudly delivering a cup of hot watery milk. She was only about seven years old at the time.

Anyway.

Time to go find my shoes and socks. At least it's not raining today (yet).

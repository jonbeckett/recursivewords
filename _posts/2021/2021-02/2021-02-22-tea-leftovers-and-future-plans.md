It's my last day off work today - the end of an attempt to use up a few days holiday while the kids were on half-term. The weather has been despicable throughout, so we've gone nowhere and done nothing for the last week. My other half works in a school so she was home too - she almost became nocturnal. We wondered if it was her body's way of resetting after a pretty stressful term through the second lockdown.

I just ate leftovers for lunch - we had sausage casserole for dinner last night. Best leftovers lunch ever. There is still a huge tub of leftover vegetarian bolognese in the fridge - that might make it as far as tomorrow lunchtime, but I wouldn't put money on it.

In other news, an email arrived this morning from Wordpress - informing me that my account is up for renewal towards the end of March. I'm pretty certain that I'm not going to renew it. I'm not going to stop writing - I'll still post to substack - I just won't be cross-posting to Wordpress and Tumblr any more. I guess in some ways it's a reaction to Wordpress' gradual change of course, but also that we are actively avoiding spending money, and that I need to stop distracting myself quite so much. Having a finger in every pie is fun, but you end up getting nothing done.

I killed my homepage on the internet last night, and redirected the domain to Medium. Again - simplifying, reducing, and hopefully helping me focus on one or two things instead of five or six. You never know - I might even start writing the novel I've been promising myself for the last decade.

I've had a few ideas for young adult novels up my sleeve for years. It's about time I started doing something about them.

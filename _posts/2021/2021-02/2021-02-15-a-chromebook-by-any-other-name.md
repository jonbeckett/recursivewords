Late last night I discovered a company called "Neverware" created the software to install on a USB stick that allows a computer to boot from the stick and turns it into a Chromebook. The software is called "CloudReady", and the home edition is *free*. What's more, if you like what it does, with a single click you can wipe the computer and install the Chrome operating system onto it's internal storage - turning it completely into a Chromebook. Neverware did their job so well, Google acquired them.

I almost did a happy dance.

Needless to day, I now have a recycled Chromebook of sorts - built from an old laptop that has been sitting in the bottom of a bag for months. Granted, it's not *quite* as good as a shiny-new-chromebook (new Chromebooks can run Android apps), but it's pretty close.

In other news, I went for a mental health walk at lunchtime with my eldest daughter - a promised wander to the park to get some fresh air. We fed the swans, avoided the legion of parents with small children that have never heard of social distancing, and found a park bench to sit at for a little while - watching the world go by. Afterwards we bought soup and nice bread for everybody (it's half term), and carried it home.

I have no idea what I'm going to spend the rest of the day doing. A part of me says I should use today as a writing day (I have Mondays off work at the moment) - but another part says I should kick back and have fun. Hang on - shouldn't writing be fun?

Perhaps I'll put some music on. Where's that Sara Bareilles playlist?

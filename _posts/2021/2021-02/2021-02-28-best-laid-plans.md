Somehow it's already the last day of February. How did that happen? It feels like Christmas was only five minutes ago. Sunday morning has been all about chores so far. We're now nearing lunchtime, and I'm wondering where the morning went too. I wonder about a lot of things at the moment.

I had been planning to take part in something online this afternoon, but it appears those plans got bulldozed as soon as my other half arrived in the kitchen this morning. We're taking part in an online quiz this evening, so dinner has been pushed up to lunchtime. If I even breathe that I was planning on doing something else early this afternoon, the world will fall on my head.

I better go. I have to go and prepare the vegetables, put the clothes away that are in folded clothes all over the dining table, and do whatever else needs doing.

(three hours pass)

Just to throw an even bigger selection of spanners into the day, it turned out our eldest daughter wanted to go for a walk. This turned into all of us going for a walk. A non-optional walk. We walked down past the rugby club to the river, and then started to pick our way along the footpath. Having made it about a quarter of a mile, we turned back because there were so many people ignoring any sort of distancing measures it became impossible to make any further progress.

People ruin everything.

While wandering back, we saw a possible shortcut that leads through a private road. I debated if we were allowed to walk along it, and while discussing it, an older lady with a battleship hairdo rushed past, and proclaimed that she always walked that way. Turns out it's a private road - only residents should walk along it. Very few people seem to take any notice.

If nothing else, this year of lockdown has brought into very clear focus just how many thoughtless, selfish, ignorant, self absorbed assholes there are in the world.

Lunch was supposed to be at 1pm. It's now 2:30pm. I bet it will be 3pm - and then I'll struggle to get the washing up done before the quiz. We shall see.

p.s. the irony isn't lost on me that I could be getting ready for lunch right now rather than complaining into this word processor.

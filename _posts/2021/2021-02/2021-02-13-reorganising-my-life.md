For the last few months I've been experimenting with an online swiss-army-knife called "Notion", that allows you to record notes, compile databases of information, and so on. It has a wonderful interface, and can be transformed to solve most use-cases - a veritable rabbit hole that promises all sorts of productivity games. I started using it for more and more bits and pieces of my life - storing blog blog posts, writing articles, keeping code snippets, and so on.

And then it went down. For almost an entire day. With no updates from the management team. At all.

So yesterday evening I started migrating everything away from Notion. Initially I thought about returning to Evernote - and even tweeted about it - but then faced an uphill battle in terms of importing existing posts without having to laboriously re-format writing for hours. After trying several different workarounds I gave up, and turned my gaze to Google Drive.

Sure, Google Drive has it's problems - nothing's perfect - but for most of the things I do, it's "good enough". I've migrated all my old blog posts across, all of my technical notes, and all of the other bits and pieces that were stored in either Notion or Evernote. Google Drive has become my "one place to rule them all" - for now.

I need to stop playing with shiny new toys on the internet, and just live with the core few things I trust. At the moment that's all the Google apps - from Mail, to Calendar, Keep, Drive, and Photos. Just recently I've been using Google Meet for family video calls - it's every bit as good as Zoom or Facebook Messenger, and is free.

Earlier today I walked into town with my youngest daughter on a grocery shopping expedition. The first in several weeks. We get most of our food delivered via local farms and produce delivery businesses - but there are certain things you can't easily get for them - important things - like peanut butter, and chocolate spread.

We've been ordering some things in bulk from Amazon "subscribe and save" - and had been thinking about buying instant cappuccino in a huge tin, but after doing the math, it turns out buying small boxes of instant coffee when it's on offer is cheaper than buying in bulk. I hate it when brands do that kind of counter-intuitive idiocy. They must think people were born yesterday (perhaps some people don't think when looking at prices).

Anyway. Dinner will be ready in a minute. Time to go set the table.

I stopped drinking coffee yesterday morning (or the night before, in the interests of accuracy). I've had a headache all day - which I suppose is somewhat predictable after drinking coffee like a funnel for the last twenty something years.

Actually, that's not entirely true. I've stopped drinking coffee before. For some reason whenever I'm sick I revert to tea. I can't remember being sick since about eighteen months ago. The autumn before COVID launched itself across the world I was sick as a dog for about two months.

Anyway.

On reflection, today wasn't the best day to not have coffee nearby. I got thrown in at the deep end with work - assigned to work on something that I had little or no knowledge of. An entire technology platform that I've somehow missed or avoided for the last couple of years. Not any more.

I wrote a long-ass post over at [Medium](https://jonbeckett.medium.com/the-caffeine-detox-experiment-9065f8ce5ee) about detoxing from caffeine. I ended up writing down a horrifying list of some of the things that have caffeine in them. In the end, I just ended up wondering how many 500g bars of dairy milk add up to the same as cup of coffee. I could totally chug chunks of chocolate instead of coffee. Straight swap. Sure, I would have no teeth, a fat gut, and be covered in spots, but I would be happy.

I'm sure I'll cheer up by tomorrow.

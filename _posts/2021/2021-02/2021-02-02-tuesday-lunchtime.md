I had been entertaining the idea of escaping at lunchtime, and going for a walk. A few miles out in the fresh air on my own with a podcast in my ears. The weather has other ideas - it has rained pretty consistently all morning. We are forecast snow next weekend.

I have half an hour of my lunch break left. Half an hour to fall down an internet rabbit hole and get nothing done. Spotify is busing playing "Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters" from a random playlist chosen to fill the silence.

I switched out the theme of my blog before work started this morning - simplifying it enormously. I'm not sure why. I have a suspicion that most people live in the Wordpress or Tumblr interfaces, or email subsciptions anyway - they don't venture to the web to look at much any more.

Writing over at Medium has kind of dried up for the moment. Probably a good thing, because writing when you have nothing to write about is death to creativity and inspiration. I have no doubt I could churn out cookie cutter articles like many citizen journalists seem to, and make a tidy living from it - I'm not sure I would be able to live with myself though. I would rather tell personal stories than parrot manufactured idiocy.

I'm drinking too much coffee at the moment. I imagine boredom has a lot to do with it. Perhaps I'll get some ginger tea, and substitute out coffee for a few weeks. While thinking about health, I weighed myself this morning. I'm up three pounds from where I was a couple of months ago. I wonder how quickly I can drop it again? Watch this space.

It would appear the world has woken up - and then some. After being partly furloughed for several weeks, and taking holidays while it has been quiet, I logged back in this morning to a succession of back-to-back meetings. I can't decide if I'm relieved, excited, reassured, nervous, or filled with dread.

I wonder how people will deal with a return to "normal" this year? Or even if "normal" will be the same as it once was. I imagine standing on a packed train will cause quite a lot of fear among most people - although I also wonder how many people will travel to meetings any more, given the emergence of video conference calls.

The company I work for sold the office during the first lockdown, and have operated without issue with an entirely remote workforce - in much the same way that Automattic have since they were founded (they make Wordpress). Perhaps working from home really will be the "new normal" for many traditionally office-based roles.

Away from work I'm trying to untangle the various things I've been dabbling with over the last few years. A part of that means a rename for both Wordpress and Tumblr.

Anyway.

Lunchtime has come to an end. It's time to recoil in horror at the list of tasks scribbled across my bullet journal once again. Wish me luck.

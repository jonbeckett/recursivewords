It's Saturday afternoon, and you find me sitting in the junk room with an empty wine glass, reasoning with myself that two small glasses of wine are quite enough, and that if I drink any more I'll regret it.

Somehow the day transformed itself from a relatively quiet start into a trip to two garden centres in search of rocks (for the pond), and a walk to the local COVID vaccination place to get my second jab. As mentioned, I'm now home, and two small glasses into the remains of a bottle of wine. I imagine coffee isn't far away in my predicted timeline.

News of the day - the pond that we dug a couple of weeks ago and filled with water already has frogs in it. Where do they come from? This happened twenty years ago when we first dug the pond - frogs arrived by magic, and filled the pond with frogspawn. We have only just got around to dropping some oxygenating plants into the water. Hopefully the frog(s) will do something about the army of insects already laying eggs in the pond.

Three more days of furlough are stretched ahead of me next week, then I'm back "full time", or rather "full panic". We always knew the furlough was a short-term arrangement - taking advantage of the assistance while it was there. The world is slowly waking back up, and my immediate future suddenly looks rather more stressful than it has for the last few months (discounting the few seconds where I thought the computer might burn the house down).

If the weather remains nice, I'm hoping to get out on some long walks with my eldest daughter next week. Alongside that I'll continue with the "Couch to 5K" idiocy - I'm on week 5 now, and working through the various runs like an automaton. The knee pain has gone, and my achilles tendons seem to be fine. Fingers crossed no further unexpected injuries happen over the coming weeks.

Anyway.

Time for that coffee.

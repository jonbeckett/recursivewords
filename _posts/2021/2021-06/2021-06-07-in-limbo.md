After working consistently through the the last 18 months, the company I work for are starting to take advantage of the "flexible furlough" opportunities to stand a few of us down while waiting for projects to start.

This week *might* see me furloughed for the first time. The "flexible furlough" rules allow for staff to continue with training while not working on commercial projects - which will be really good - there are several things I've been trying to find time to learn in recent months.

Of course, knowing the way the world works, the situation will change before the end of the day and any prospect of pursuing academic interests will go out of the window once more.

Being in limbo feels strange.

It's Friday evening, and the "week off" has vanished. I'm wondering where it went. The last few days are a mental jumble of running, working on the garden, doing chores, and jumping down internet rabbit holes.

In-between the usual mayhem, I have been slowly falling back into the clutches of Medium - writing essays, and publishing them into their partner programme. Choosing subjects that people might be interested in is something of a mystery to me at the moment - a little like throwing spaghetti at the wall to find out what sticks. I wrote a throw-away piece yesterday that gained immediate traction - then spent all morning today writing a well researched long-form piece, published it, and waited for several hours. Nothing. It's all a bit of a mystery.

I have to keep telling myself that Medium is very different than Wordpress. Where blogs are very much about the "here and now", essays are more about ideas and thoughts - they float around for longer in the content delivery machine, and unexpectedly re-surface months after you've written them. An article I wrote in January suddenly earned over a hundred dollars last month. I'm guessing it caught the wave of a trending topic somewhere.

I guess the take-away is that I'm writing again. That's good, right? I suppose I'm not posting here though, and I'm not "present" on social media though.

Saying that, I finally started playing with "stories" on Instagram this week - the self destroying photos that only live for a little while. I was sitting in McDonalds with my youngest daughter (our first meal out together for 18 months!), waiting for her to finish. I didn't realise you can have the story photos appear both on your Instagram wall, and on Facebook as a "story". It's all tremendously confusing.

Anyway. I should probably be writing something of consequence, rather than emptying my head here. I guess this keeps me sane though. I will be back soon, honest.

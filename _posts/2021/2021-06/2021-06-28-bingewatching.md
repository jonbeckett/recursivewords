It's Monday afternoon, and you find me sitting in the junk room at home with a cafe-society playlist humming away in the background. Rain has been falling throughout the day, and the washing machine has been working it's way through load after load of clothes, which are now hanging all over the house.

I had my second COVID jab on Saturday afternoon. By the evening the side effects had turned up like an out-of-control steamroller, and really uncorked their A-Game by Sunday morning. I still have a few aches and pains, but they are subsiding. It turns out my body is quite good at reacting to viruses, or their vaccines. With a little luck and after an early night tonight I'll be back out running tomorrow morning.

While feeling sorry for myself, I've been catching up on the various television series I had half-watched recently. I'm still working my way through "Ragnarok" - a modern re-telling of the Norse legends, and managed to binge-watch the entire run of "Katla" in two nights (yes, it was that good - it's on Netflix - look it up).

I'm not sure what I might watch or read next. I'm in a bit of a funk, if I'm honest. A couple of days nursing aching joints kind of erases the impetus to get of your arse and actually do anything (beyond tidy the house up, which is an on-going hell-chore for the ages).

My middle daughter bought me a bottle of Lucozade at lunchtime - a fizzy glucose drink that makes you feel better while simultaneously rotting your teeth away. I'm drinking it. Don't ask me to smile.

Anyway. I guess this blog post comes straight from the "forcing yourself to write something" drawer. Hopefully it wasn't too arduous to read. I'll try to have something a little more interesting to read soon. Honest.

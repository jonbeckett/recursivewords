Tomorrow doesn't start until I wake up in the morning. The clock might have ticked past midnight a few minutes ago, but I'm going to claim it's still "tonight" - "tomorrow morning" doesn't arrive for several hours.

Welcome to my ever-so-slightly illogical mind.

I'm playing the age old game of "staying up late to avoid tomorrow", which is ridiculous because there's nothing I'm particularly avoiding. Perhaps I'm just holding on to today - making the day last longer - enjoying the last few minutes in front of the keyboard emptying my head.

I'm trying to warm back up after venturing outside in the dark to put the bins out - the refuse collectors pass our house in the morning. Have you ever tried to drag a wheelie bin down your driveway in the dead of night? They transform themselves into mobile speaker stacks - amplifying every bump in the driveway into a cacophony of crashing and crunching.

I sometimes wonder if I'm the only person that puts the rubbish out at midnight (or rather, that only remembers at midnight). I've never seen anybody else tiptoeing around while dragging the bin down the driveway. Perhaps the rest of the world is far more organised? I don't know.

Anyway.

It's getting late. I should probably go brush my teeth.

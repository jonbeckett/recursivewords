Lockdown has partly come to an end in the UK - not that some people took any notice of it what-so-ever. Pubs, restaurants, and shops re-open today, albeit with all manner of social distancing and safeguarding rules.

I think I'll stay the hell away from town for at least another six months. I'm going to predict the third wave will happen, and it will be driven by the same asshats that caused the second wave.

It appears some people have a massive disassociation in their brain - where what they want to do doesn't correlate with guidance, rules, or law. Their immediate wants or needs outweigh everybody and everything else around them. You might call them selfish, ignorant, unthinking, or just plain assholes. The pandemic didn't create them - they were here all along - it's just their blind self-interest didn't affect others so much in the past.

Anyway. Deep breaths.

I have the week off. When I looked out of the bedroom window at 7am this morning, snow was falling. I grinned, and wondered if that was just nature's way of sticking it's fingers up at me. I imagine by dinner time we'll have fire, brimstone, and plagues of something or other.

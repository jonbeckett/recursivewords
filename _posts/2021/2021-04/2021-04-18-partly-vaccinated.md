I received my first COVID vaccination shot today. My age group became available to apply last week - I left it a few hours before looking at the website, then booked the appointments. The nearest dispensing station was about ten minutes walk from home, which made the choice largely academic. I received the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine.

If I get side-effects, they will appear within 12 hours. Fingers crossed I don't get clobbered too hard by them - I've got a busy week ahead planned with work (I suppose plans can be changed though). My other half was knocked out for about three days.

My return to work tomorrow follows a week off. It has felt a little like limbo.

Fingers crossed I don't wake up in the middle of the night shivering.

The last few days have served as a reminder of how wonderful the blogging tribe has become. I'm not talking about the niche food, fashion, or lifestyle bloggers - they can go fall off their marketing tricycle and graze their knees - I'm talking about those of us that have been committing our daily stories to the keyboard for the last twenty years.

The term "blogger" means many things to many people. By turns we can be autobiographers, citizen journalists, soap-box campaigners, armchair psychologists, social commentators, and even historians. The best of us don't push a brand, a product, or a way to live a life - we tell our own story.

I have a quote by Norah Ephron printed on a piece of paper above my desk:

wp:quote  

> One of the most delicious things about the profoundly parasitical world of blogs is that you don't have to have anything much to say. Or you just have to have a little tiny thing to say. You just might want to say hello. I'm here. And by the way. On the other hand. Nevertheless. Did you see this? Whatever. A blog is sort of like an exhale. What you hope is that whatever you're saying is true for about as long as you're saying it. Even if it's not much.

I sometimes notice others striving to emulate the style of their literary heroes - I've never done that. I tend to think we should find our own way - find our own voice. While it's true that reading influences the style and selection of words we write, I have always admired those that say more with less.

I've distracted myself from the original intent of this post. It's a skill. I'm good at it. It ranks right up there with walking into the kitchen to make a coffee, and clearing the sink, emptying the dishwasher, and taking the recycling out before switching the kettle on.

The tribe. Us. The writers.

We may be quiet, and we may be passed over by many, but we are here, we are numerous, and we persist. We will continue to wield our words against the world that shapes us, and we will continue to find each other at the most unlikely times, and in the most unexpected places.

We are bloggers.

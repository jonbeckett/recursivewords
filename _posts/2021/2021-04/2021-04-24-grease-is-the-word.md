It's heading towards 8pm in the evening, I'm sitting alone in the junk room listening to the Grease soundtrack on Spotify while the light slowly dies outside, and I'm wondering where the day went.

Frankie Valli is singing the title track. I think it might be my favourite on the entire album. When I was young we borrowed the video tape of Grease from my aunt - who was either in her late teens, or early twenties when the movie came out. We watched it for an entire summer, and knew the words to all of the songs - often singing them with other kids in the neighbourhood in the evenings. Such innocent times - we had no idea what Kenickie and Rizzo got up to in the back of his car.

My other half has gone to fetch our youngest daughter from a meetup with several of her friends. I think she felt guilty about turning us into a taxi service to deliver and fetch her, so bought her mum a jigsaw and some liquorice to say thankyou. Perhaps I should correct that - the "bank of Dad" bought the jigsaw.

The rest of the day has been spent in the garden - slowly removing junk and doing runs to the rubbish tip. Of course the junk has mysteriously been exchanged with new plants following a somewhat secretive trip to the garden centre - I'm guessing that's the universe's "conservation of mass" law kicking in.

Tomorrow morning is rugby practice for my younger daughters. A surprise present arrived for them this morning - an "Ultimate" frisbee. The coaches have been looking for interesting "socially distanced" alternatives to shake-up the training sessions. Frisbee is a natural fit, and "Ultimate" frisbees are built like a tank (so should survive 20 teenage girl rugby players flinging it at each other). Who knows - perhaps the rugby club might even look at fielding a frisbee team in the off-season if it catches on.

Beauty School Drop Out just started playing. I'm sorry - I can't type any more - all I can think of is the rest of the female cast of Grease hidden in plain sight in the scene with the pyramid of girls in silver curlers. It took me *years* to realise they were all in that scene.

Dammit - I'm going to have to go watch the movie now, aren't I.

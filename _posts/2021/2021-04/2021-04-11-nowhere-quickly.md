It's Sunday afternoon, I'm sitting in the junk room in front of the computer, the chores are done, my other half is out, and Norah Jones is singing about being Alive on the colossal beat box my cousin from California got me for my birthday.

I woke at 6:30am this morning, and stared at the ceiling for an hour before getting up.

I'm sipping an instant cappuccino made from a packet that isn't half bad, and wondering what to write next. Probably a defence of instant coffee would be a good start. I'm pretty sure there's a very vocal yet tiny minority who own coffee machines that cost more than a family car that only touch coffee beans from a small corner of Africa.

While on the subject of idiots, I saw a wonderful take-down the other day - where an anti-masker was mansplaining about half a million years of evolution not evolving face masks, therefore we shouldn't wear them. The first comment asked "do you wear shoes?"

If nothing else, the last year has highlighted both how wonderful people can be, and how horrific too. I keep reading that "the world has changed". Of course it has - just like it does every day, for everybody.

So. I have a week off work. I'm a little giddy at the prospect at the moment - filling my head with all the things I won't get done. Apart from cutting the grass. If I don't get the grass cut, I'm fairly certain we could film another sequel to Jumanji in our back garden. For all I know, one of the Jonas brothers really *has* been living at the end of the garden for the last however many years.

I stepped back into the "interpals" foray one evening last week. It bills itself as a website for finding pen-pals. I thought it might be a good idea to build a bigger circle of online friends for myself, but quickly remembered why I walked away some time ago - within minutes several men and women had messaged me, inviting me to learn about Bitcoin, and a seemingly lovely chinese lady cut me off at "hello" (having not read my profile) because she was "only looking for husband". I wondered if she was looking for *a* husband, or *her specific* husband... had she lost him? Had he run away? Was he sneaking around doing bitcoin deals behind her back?

I think maybe the best idea is to just write my words in the blog, and see who finds them. The internet is pretty good at connecting the dots between people all on it's own if you have a little faith in it (and tag the crap out of everything).

Maybe when we finally climb back out of lockdown, I'll explain my continued absence by leaving a note on the front door - "I have replaced my circle of real-world friends with bitcoin scam robots - they're surprisingly good listeners".

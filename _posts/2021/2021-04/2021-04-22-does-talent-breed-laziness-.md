I have been head-down with work for the last several days. Being busy is good. Unfortunately the garden has taken its cue to inject anything that will grow with Captain America growth serum. I'm pretty sure we will have mangrove swamps by the weekend. I've done a deal with my eldest daughter that if she helps me with the garden, I will take part in the internet art course she started some weeks ago. I've already warned her that I'm colourblind, but she hasn't let that dissuade her.

Being honest, I've tried not to do any drawing or painting alongside the children for good reason - if they see what I can do, they will compare themselves against me - it's happened before and it never goes well (or at least it didn't when they were younger). I've never quite figured out why some kids are enthused when they see talent, and others give up.

I would argue that what I have isn't talent - it's the result of hard work. I tend to think being interested in something and working hard will always yield better results than talent. I suppose the reverse should therefore be true - that the most talented are the most lazy. Quite a controversial statement. How many of us have known people that were exceptional at something, but never took advantage of it ? I've seen it. I'm betting teachers see it all the time, and it frustrates them enormously.

Anyway.

It's late. I'm jabbering on about nothing at all (as per usual), and I have work in the morning. Time to go read a book, and fall asleep with it propped on my chest.

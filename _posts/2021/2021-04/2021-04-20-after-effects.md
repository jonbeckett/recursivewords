After receiving the first COVID vaccine injection on Sunday evening, the side effects began mid-morning on Monday. Throughout Monday, my body began to slowly seize up. The famous "aches and pains" friends and neighbours had talked about.

I didn't think much about it until lunchtime, when I decided to walk to the corner shop and get supplies of energy drink and chocolate to see me through the next couple of days. It turns out you don't tend to notice your body seizing up while you're sitting still. Half-way to the corner shop, I began wondering if it had been such a good idea.

Eating two days supply of chocolate in one afternoon was definitely a good idea.

A little after lunch the headache began to arrive, and convinced me to down tools for the day. It wasn't a bad headache, so I didn't bother taking anything - I just took myself off to bed, and slept.

Here's the odd thing I've noticed about my physiology - I don't like coffee when I'm sick. It's the strangest thing. I made myself a cup of tea before going to bed yesterday afternoon, and made another after dinner in the evening. Oh - that's another strange thing - I can pretty much defeat any sense of "not being hungry" when I'm sick - and eat because I know I should to at least give myself fuel to fight whatever is coursing around my body.

So that's how I fell asleep just after dinner last night - with a body filled with chocolate, energy drinks, risotto, and several cups of tea.

At about 4am this morning I woke up with really quite an impressive headache. A proper headache. I stared at the ceiling for a little while before deciding that paracetamol was better than bravery, and stumbled off down the stairs in search of the magical tablets.

When the alarm clock went off at 7am, the headache had gone, along with all of the aches and pains. It would appear that my body had successfully gone to war during the night.

So. I'm out of the woods. Ready to fight another day. All those other similar words.

And I'm still drinking tea.

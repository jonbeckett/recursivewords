For the last three years I have used a bullet journal to both plan, and record each day. It has sat on the corner of my desk, and served as a duplicate of sorts to my work calendar, my home calendar, and the various productivity apps I have tinkered with along the way.

Name a well known app, and I've probably used it. Microsoft To Do, Google Tasks, Evernote, Notion, Todoist, Basecamp, Trello, Outlook, Keep... the list goes on.

Years ago I read a book called "Getting Things Done" that very successfully sold an enormous lie to pretty much everybody that read it. Off the back of it I became invested for a time in a website called "Remember the Milk", and an app on my phone called "Things".

It's a slippery slope.

The bullet journal has served as an antidote of sorts to the chaotic, fast moving world of technology that surrounds me (I'm a software developer). It's not perfect though - it doesn't nag me when something hasn't been done, and it's not searchable either. I've lost count of the times I have paged back through it over several months, looking for a note. My brain works in mysterious ways - I often know I wrote something down, but don't remember exactly what I wrote.

I'm going to try *not* using the bullet journal for a while. My work life lives in the Microsoft universe - Outlook, To Do, Teams and Sharepoint - and my home life in the constellation of Google services - Calendar, Keep, Tasks, and GDrive. I'm going to give their various apps and websites a shot. My life will live in my pocket - in the little black phone that I carry everywhere.

The one extra I am adding to the mix is "Notion". If you've not seen it, and you have a penchant for being organised, I would stay the hell away from it. It's a black hole of possibilities and opportunities to waste time organising, recording, and sorting anything and everything. It's actually pretty brilliant. You have been warned.

Anyway. Enough of this idiocy.

I'm planning to visit town with two of my daughters tomorrow morning - while one of them meets up with friends to head away for the weekend, I'm going to do a raid on the second-hand video game store. It turns out if you time it right, you can bulk buy games that used to sell for PS50 for PS1 each. In another year those same games will begin climbing in value as they become collectors items.

Thankfully my kids aren't huge video game players - so they don't really mind which generation of hardware we have. For months we had a Raspberry Pi plugged into the television, allowing them to play any number of retro arcade machines. It's always fun when grown-up friends visit, and notice a copy of Pacman, Space Invaders or Galaxians running on the TV - with sounds they have not heard since standing at the side of cabinets in amusement arcades thirty or more years before.

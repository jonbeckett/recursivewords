I got halfway through saying "what time on Saturday?" before she furiously responded with "DON'T BOTHER!".

Half an hour later I had asked others to help run the event in my place.

The walk was actually ok - it was good to get out in the fresh air, even if it was bitterly cold. After trudging perhaps four miles around the estate of an old house, we found a picnic bench near the car and huddled around packed lunches with our coats on, shivering while convincing ourselves it was "good to be out".

Late last night I collapsed onto the sofa and tried to watch "The Expanse" again. I've so far watched the first episode twice (months apart), and now three quarters of the second episode. To say it's slow going is an understatement. I'm wondering quite how it has reached five seasons. There MUST be something redeeming about it, surely?

This morning was altogether different. The sun shone, the birds sang, and I walked into town with my eldest daughter while my other half took the younger girls to rugby practice. The entire escapade was really a distraction from her melting down over starting her new job tomorrow morning. I think it mostly worked.

We walked to the big park in the middle of town, avoiding crowds along the way. While standing waiting for coffee from the cafe (a rare treat), we were stunned at being the only people wearing masks. I'm still amazed at the ignorance, arrogance, thoughtlessness, and stupidity of seemingly the vast majority of people.

I nearly forgot - I rented "Gozilla vs Kong" (or is it the other way around?) from Amazon Prime late last week. It's fun, in a completely non-memorable kind of way. It was exciting, loud, and had almost no story to speak of. It strikes me that a lot of movies have fallen into that hole recently.

Anyway. It's Easter Sunday afternoon, there's a huge pile of easter eggs next to me that I can't quite face, and Miss Seventeen is cooking roast dinner. Perhaps it's time to find a book and a quiet corner.

Over the last few days I have been arm twisting a wonderful blogging friend that has remained largely undiscovered in the wilds of LiveJournal.

While Tumblr and Wordpress marched across the blogging landscape, crushing all in their wake, she quietly persisted - recording her thoughts about life, the universe, and everything into a quiet corner of the internet, far away from the madding crowd.

We have imported her legacy into Wordpress, and placed it safely under lock and key - over a decade of fond memories for her to take out now and again, to admire, and to perhaps recount with the world from time to time.

Her name is Katy, and she has a steep path ahead - learning not only about Wordpress, but about profiles, pages, tags, featured images, following, followers, likes, subscriptions, and so on.

I have of course painted a wonderful picture of the quiet army of bloggers she will fall into the middle of, so it's really on me now to convince her that you are actually out there - that you exist.

It's funny - those of us that empty our head in the form of online journals began this damn fool crusade perhaps twenty years ago, and while it sometimes feels like we are relatively few, I suspect the truth may be we never really went away - the crowd around us just got bigger, and more distracting.

Anyway.

Please take a moment to read [Katy's first post at Wordpress](https://webgirluk.wordpress.com/2021/04/24/blogging-experiment/), and wish her well.

I have the rest of the week off work!

Because I've worked at the same company for years, I've pretty much maxed out the holiday allocation - accruing 25 days per calendar year. We have to take Christmas, Easter and so on from the allocation, but still - it amounts to about 4 weeks during the year. On top of that, we are allowed to carry over up to 5 unused days - or up to 10 under extraordinary circumstances.

Long story short - after working on big projects two years running, I arrived at the start of this year with over 30 days in my back pocket.

I'm almost giddy with excitement - it's still only 9:40am - I've tidied the lounge up, cleared the dishes in the kitchen, emptied the dishwasher, and put two loads of clothes through the washing machine already.

I have no plans for the week, short of spending time helping our youngest with home-school work when she needs it, and (apparently) recording a work-out for her PE coursework later. I imagine she's going to turn into the coach from Glee this afternoon, and laugh at my pathetic attempts to follow instruction.

I'm sitting at the dining room table, surrounded by piles of folded laundry. It seems stunning to me that even though we have gone nowhere and done nothing for months, the washing machine is till being run into the ground every day. I'm starting to wonder if the bottom of the laundry basket is entirely mythical.

It just occurred to me that I should write something on the blog. Somehow I've fallen away from writing nearly every day, to writing every few days. Perhaps the promise I made to myself to read books, watch movies, and spend time with my family is working.

I've been reading "The Queen's Gambit" over the last several evenings - I've nearly finished it now. It's every bit as good as the TV series, but perhaps I still have rose tinted glasses - the TV series was incredible. The next book on the heap is Ready Player Two - which seems like a re-tread of Ready Player One. I'll reserve judgement until I've read it properly - I snuck a little of it at Christmas while sitting quietly in the lounge one night.

We're still working our way through the box of movies scribbled on raffle tickets. We watched "Eurovision", and "Bumblebee" last week.

Last night we organised a quiz on Zoom for family and friends. It was fun - a lot of the older family members had never been on a webcam before, so doing tech support for the first half an hour was a bit of a struggle. We got there in the end. As always, the "after party" was probably more fun than the quiz itself - the drinks and snacks came out, and we all got to say hello to people we had not seen for years in some cases.

Anyway.

I have a book to go finish reading. I'll write again soon!

*p.s. the [other blog](https://jonbeckett.medium.com) at Medium is doing really well. It's a bit scary.*

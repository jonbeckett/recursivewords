It's not so much a case of "falling off the blogging bike" any more - more a case of "has anybody seen the damn bike?". Or maybe "can I even remember how to ride it?". It's not like I'm pushing away for any particular reason, or even that I'm "pushing away". Life is just happening.

Was it John Lennon that said "life is what happens while you're making other plans" ?

I'm a bit annoyed with myself, to be honest. I started to reach out to a few people online recently - following a few new voices. After an evening of "being brave", I've hardly been back. I hope those I followed don't think badly of me. Perhaps this afternoon I'll carve out some time to go read and comment on their recent posts.

I'm sitting in the junk room, sipping coffee, and listening to Sara Bareilles. I should be working on some writing for the work website, but inspiration seems to have deserted me - hence writing this post instead.

Oh - random update - I hung a new door last week, armed only with a chisel, a screwdriver, a hammer, and a sanding machine. There's a back-story here - once upon a time our eldest daughter had the room with the door that needed replacing. She once kicked it off it's hinges in temper, and I patched it up. A few weeks ago one of our neighbours advertised a door to anybody that wanted it - of the same design as the broken bedroom door. My other half got the kids to go and fetch it, and it's stood in our hallway until this week. Here's the thing - door frames are very rarely square, and doors are often cut to fit the door frame they are in. I had to re-shape the frame, the door, re-position the (new) hinges, and re-position the locking plate in order to make it fit. I did mention all I had was a chisel and a sander, didn't I?

I think we're all beyond stir crazy now. We've been holed up in the house together since late autumn. Little annoyances have begun to pull at the loose ends of each other. The children often contribute nothing in terms of help around the house, and then expect everything in return. It's not going to end well for them.

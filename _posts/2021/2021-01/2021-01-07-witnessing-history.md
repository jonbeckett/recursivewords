I stayed up most of last night watching history unfold on the other side of the world - watching what surely must be the end of Donald Trump. Now I wonder what will come of the people that listen to him, follow him, and are inspired by him.

I'm only really connected to the unfolding news through the wonderful people I know that live in America. I've come to know their various hopes and dreams, and witnessed their frustrations over the past few years.

It's a strange experience - being on the outside, looking in.

It occurs to me that we are all re-writing our rule books at the moment - or at least the rule books we hope most people follow - the rule books that govern the things we do, the things we don't do, and the things we never even contemplate doing.

People are quick to blame social networks as an "enabler". While the algorithmic timeline has played a part in surrounding us with, and amplifying concordant views, I can't help feeling that most blame is often employed to shirk responsibility.

There is too much entitlement, ignorance, and apathy in the world at the moment. If everybody cared a little more, and had the courage to stand up for what's right a little more often, the world would be a very different place.

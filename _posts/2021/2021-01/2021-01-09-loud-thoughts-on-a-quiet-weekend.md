It's been very quiet indeed around here for the last few days. After a scare mid-week where my youngest daughter had to do a COVID test, we have stayed holed up in the house for almost the entire time. I walked to the supermarket last night to get groceries, but other than that we have gone nowhere and done nothing.

I'm beginning to understand what Stir Crazy really means.

Of course the huge distraction this week has been history unfolding in America - and I've been trying to do my usual fence sitting act - to read and watch a variety of news sources. It's so hard - trying to have any empathy at all for those I know that think of themselves as republican. Their ideals and values pretty much go against everything I know - and yet I try not to say anything untoward.

While reading an interview yesterday expressing disbelief that so many people believe the stream of lies, falsehoods, and fraud coming from so many in positions of power, I couldn't help thinking about all the religious people I know, and thinking how two faced everybody is. How is believing in election fraud any different than believing in a magical creator figure in the sky that gets credit for anything good, and is escaped from the argument for anything bad?

People believe what they want to believe, and there's nothing we can really do about it.

The world is just tremendously broken. Perhaps we're fortunate that it doesn't go spectacularly wrong more often.

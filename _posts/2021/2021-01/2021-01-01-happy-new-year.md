The clock is just ticking past 11am on New Years Day, and I'm still trying to wake up. I think we eventually went to bed some time after 2am. I hosted a quiz for friends on Zoom during the evening - and what started out as a 2 hour video call somehow turned into 6 hours, with friends dropping in along the way, playing games together, and eventually ringing in the New Year together.

We are so fortunate to know so many wonderful people. Even though there is talk about meeting up when the world returns to some kind of normal, the evening proved that we will still find ways to reach each other.

I think today may be a very quiet day.

It's interesting - sitting here, quietly writing this, and listening to the rest of the household slowly raise from their slumber. One of the kids just launched Alexa from the bath - shouting at her to play one of the London commercial radio stations. I imagine in about an hour one of the other kids will complain there is no hot water.

Anyway - I need to go find something to eat. I'm thinking some toast.

Happy New Year to you and yours, and fingers crossed for the year ahead.

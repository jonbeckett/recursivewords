My other half just got back from visiting her family, who we have not seen since the end of last summer due to the lockdown. They met at a National Trust property in the middle of nowhere to go for a walk, and exchanged Christmas presents in the car park. I can't help smiling - it must have looked like the most festive mafia handover ever.

I now have two new books to read! (to add to the mountain that got higher on Christmas Day, and is now higher again).

The first book is a thriller called "Dark Matter" by Blake Crouch:

> 

> In this world he's woken up to, Jason's life is not the one he knows. His wife is not his wife. His son was never born. And Jason is not an ordinary college physics professor, but a celebrated genius who has achieved something remarkable. Something impossible.

> Dark Matter, by Blake Crouch  /wp:quote  The second book is a historical dramatisation called "Remarkable Creatures" by Tracy Chevalier (she of "Girl with a Pearl Earring" fame):

wp:quote  

> Mary Anning may be young and uneducated, but she has "the eye". Scouring the windswept Jurassic coast near Lyme Regis, she find the fossils nobody else can, making discoveries that will shake the scientific world of the early 19th century. But science is a male-dominated arena, and there are many who disapprove...

> 

> She finds an unlikely champion in prickly Elizabeth Philpot: unmarried, middle-aged and middle class, and a fellow fossil enthusiast. If they can weather differences in their age and standing, and overcome professional envy, will true friendship prove the rarest find of all?

> 

> Remarkable Creatures, by Tracy Chevalier  /wp:quote  I'm looking forward to reading both of them, but have to get through "Ready Player Two", and "The Ickabog" before then.

I have so many books still unread on the shelf behind me. "Rotherweird", "Night Circus", "A Gentleman in Moscow", "Snow Crash", "You", "We"... and they are just the tip of the iceberg.

Maybe this year should be the year of reading - when I try to take a step back from the computer on an evening and lose myself in all these unread books.

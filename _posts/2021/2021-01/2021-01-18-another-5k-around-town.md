Following my youngest daughter signing up for the "Couch to 5K" programme through school, she *has* to complete the training runs each week, and her sisters promised to help her with it. We're at week three, and I've already run with her twice after they no-showed on her.

Tonight we ran around town in the dark after I finished work - completing the week three run according to the programme, and then effectively doubling it. She was tired at the end, but then she's starting from a position far ahead of her sisters. It says something that she was up and ready to run before breakfast this morning, and all she could get from her sisters was grunts from their bedroom doors.

Tomorrow she has to organise and run a workout session - and film it. Apparently I may end up as a ginea pig for that too - given that I have a few days off work. If our wonderful next door neighbour looks over the fence tomorrow, she'll see me throwing kettle bells around, skipping, and collapsing in a heap somewhere.

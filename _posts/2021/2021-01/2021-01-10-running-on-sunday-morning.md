I went for a run around town with my youngest daughter this morning. She was supposed to be running with her sisters, but neither of them got out of bed. At 8am she appeared in the bedroom doorway, asking if I might go with her instead. My other half smiled at me.

She's starting a "Couch to 5k" course with her school, and has been doing the official training programme with her sisters. Here's the thing though - she's *far* fitter than them. I proved it this morning - rather than do any of the interval training she has been doing, we just went out on a long slow jog - to see what she was really capable of.

She did three and a half kilometres. A few more weeks of the interval training, and I think she'll get to five kilometres easily. As we passed a footpath that leads back towards home, I handed her my front door key and carried on to extend my distance a little - running for another three kilometres or so.

I love running early on a morning, before the rest of the world has emerged. This morning the streets were almost deserted, save for one or two people walking dogs, or out running themselves. I always say hello when passing fellow runners - they usually respond with a smile - occasionally they take no notice, and carry on frowning their way down the road. Grumpy buggers.

After getting home and having a shower I set about helping my daughter eat the remaining crumpets from the fridge - I bought them earlier in the week, during my first visit to the supermarket in about a month. I imagine I'll be returning to town in a bit to get some more groceries. I'm not entirely sure I want to brave the cold again.

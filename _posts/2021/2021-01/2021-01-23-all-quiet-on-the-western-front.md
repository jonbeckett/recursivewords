It's been a remarkably quiet week in the Beckett household. I suppose the one stand-out achievement of the week has been gaining sight of the bottom of the clothes basket. It took two determined days of running the washing machine non-stop, but at least now I know there is an end to the clothes washing nightmare. I also know that the end does not last.

I've had the week off work. While not washing dishes, clothes, or putting things away behind people, I've been doing an awful lot of nothing at all. It turns out that while you're locked down, there's not much you *can* do to amuse yourself.

In the middle of the week my youngest daughter roped me into recording a workout with her for a school project. Five minutes of madness taking part in all manner of activities that could be completed in our living room. I learned a number of gravity assisted exercises, and wanted to die a few minutes later. Who knew that working from home for a year would make me quite so unfit?

I'm supposed to go for a run in the morning, but it's below freezing tonight, and it's due to snow tomorrow. I imagine the footpaths will be turned into ice rinks. I just checked the weather forecast - the snow isn't due until 8am, so maybe we'll be able to run before it arrives.

Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go and raid the cupboards for something to eat. I'll probably end up eating cereal for supper - it's my "go to" late night snack.

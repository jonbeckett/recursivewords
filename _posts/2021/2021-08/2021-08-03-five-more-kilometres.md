After waking up a little after 7am this morning I watched the clock tick for the better part of half an hour before scraping myself out of bed, pulling some running shorts and shoes on, and wandering out into the morning air.

I really didn't feel like running, but a dogmatic voice deep inside my head started putting one foot in front of the other, and before I knew it, my legs were carrying me towards town.

Given my less than stellar performance at Parkrun on Saturday, I decided to just jog a five kilometre route around town. The route took me past several road junctions where I might have cut it short, but something kept me going. Stupidity probably.

I'm still not entirely sure how I made it back without walking at all. I really wanted to walk at the half-way stage, but didn't. I guess the words going round inside my head on repeat were "you'll be annoyed if you walk, you'll be annoyed if you walk".

I suppose the real job today was to put more miles into my body - to make running for half an hour easier. To build fitness. I go again on Thursday morning, and then return to park run for a second attempt this coming Saturday.

I must be mad.

We left the coast a little before 10am, and arrived home a little before 4pm. Allowing for an hour in a rest area at lunchtime, about 5 hours on the road.

Along the way we listened to the radio, with my daughters insisting on singing along to their favourite songs. I've never quite understood the compulsion to ruin a good song on the radio with your own voice, so anybody else listening can't hear it any more.

Anyway.

We are home. The house is still standing. Our eldest daughter (who stayed behind) didn't wreck the place. We never imagined she would, but it was nice to see that she had tried her best to keep things going.

Immediately after arriving home and unpacking the bags I walked into town to get some groceries. After returning I tried to make a coffee three times, and ended up throwing away all of the milk in the house. Another trip to the shop saw me return with milk and a bottle of wine. We didn't make the coffee in the end.

I've noticed a gradual shift across media and the internet recently that has troubled me greatly - a growing lack of intolerance and acceptance of people's differences. A great many people seem to be triggered by any view that either differs from their own, or that they feel is an attack on their circumstances or choices in any way, shape or form.

The world is becoming increasingly polarised.

We are all different - physically, culturally, educationally, spiritually, politically. Our differences make us interesting - we should embrace them. If we were all the same the world would be a very boring place.

Influencers have become an unlikely axis around which countless keyboard wars have erupted -promoting any vaguely marketable attributes in a race to the bottom of a market for eyeballs, hearts, and minds.

It doesn't help that so many either caught up in conflict or despairing of the cards they feel they have been dealt contort any argument to either divert, or to re-frame blame and attach it to anything or anybody but themselves.

A small amount of ownership, responsibility, and humility might just change the world.

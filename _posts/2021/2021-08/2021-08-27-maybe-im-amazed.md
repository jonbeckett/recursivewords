It's been a strange sort of day so far. The last day of my holiday, which has transmogrified from a vacation to a staycation - knocking around the house for the last few days. Yesterday and today have been mostly about washing clothes, washing dishes, washing more clothes, washing more dishes, hoovering, changing bedding, cutting the lawn, and... there must be something else, but I'm coming up blank at the moment.

I found myself in a tough spot when we got back from the coast - the lawnmower refused to cough and splutter it's way into life. Given that my knowledge of engines is almost non-existent, but my knowledge of Google is pretty good, I found the instruction book for the mower, visited Amazon, and bought a spark plug.

This morning - after replacing the spark plug on the engine, and giving the started rope a hopeful yank, the engine spluttered itself into life. It didn't sound particularly well, but it sounded well enough to commence battle with the rapidly overgrowing garden.

I should perhaps mention at this point that our garden is about 150ft long, and wedge shaped - it's as wide at the back as it is long. That's a LOT of grass to get overgrown.

Our little black cat is livid with me. I have removed his jungle. His chances of ripping mice, pigeons and sparrows to bits has been reduced significantly.

I feel sorry for our washing machine. Since our return it's been running non-stop. It would have had an easier run of it if my younger daughters had any concept of "tidy". After numerous threats, they tidied their bedrooms up yesterday - and generated about eight loads of washing in the process (I'm not exaggerating).

Do you anthropomorphise things? I do it all the time in my head. I have a teddy bear the kids bought me years ago that sits in the study - usually on top of a box of printer paper. I always make sure he's sitting comfortably, and nothing is leaning on him. It's not just plausible anthropomorphism either - it's stupid things, like pens and pencils - wondering if they miss each other when separated from the group. Yes, I know. I'm mad.

I'll shut up now before somebody organises a nice shirt where the arms tie together at the back.

p.s. I'm listening to a random 70s rock playlist on Spotify turned up to 11 to drown out some little girl next door that keeps screaming while playing with her siblings. Paul McCartney is singing "Maybe I'm Amazed". Good song.

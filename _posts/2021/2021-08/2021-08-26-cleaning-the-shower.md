After getting up this morning, I got in the shower and discovered what happens when you go away for a week and your eldest daughter "looks after" the house.

It took me an HOUR to clean the shower. How does black mould grow so fast? How many bottles of stuff does a teenage girl need in the shower? How much effort does it take to pick up empty bottles?

Aaaarrrggghhh...

It's worth noting, if you didn't already know me, that I live in a house with four women. Two are still teenagers, one is twenty, and the other puts up with me.

We also have two cats, who are obviously in charge.

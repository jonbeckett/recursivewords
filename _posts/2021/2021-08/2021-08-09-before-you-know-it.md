I meant to write something on Friday. And then I didn't. I meant to write something over the weekend. And then I didn't. A pattern is forming. I suppose in the past I would have written something about falling off a bike, or a horse, or some other vaguely workable idiom.

Before you know it a day has passed, then another, and another.

I miss writing. I miss the "tribe" that so many talk about. I miss being a part of the circle. Life is just getting in the way at the moment.

We are travelling down to my parents next week for a few days - perhaps the break will reset the writing bug inside me, and recharge the impulse to empty my head into the keyboard once again.

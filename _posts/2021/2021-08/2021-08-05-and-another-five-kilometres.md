I meant to write something earlier today, but work, home, chores, and everything in-between got in the way. Before you know it the day vanishes, and it's nearly midnight.

I ran again this morning. Another five kilometres. I really didn't feel like doing it (again), but the stubborn/dogmatic part of me kicked in once more and pushed me out the door.

For some reason today was the most difficult day so far - not helped by the sun noticing I had left the house, and thinking "let's f*ck him up". I get it - I'm not that fit yet. The added drain of the sun shining on me while out running was like pulling the plug out of my bath full of energy.

I go again with Park Run at the weekend. Hopefully it will get easier. With reflection, summer was NOT the best time to start this idiot escapade.

In other news, we're changing our phones at home - switching away from Apple to Android handsets. It won't make any difference to me - I've been using an Android handset for years - it will be a shock to the system for the kids though.

Anyway.

It's getting late. Time to go read, and fall asleep with a book collapsed against my chest.

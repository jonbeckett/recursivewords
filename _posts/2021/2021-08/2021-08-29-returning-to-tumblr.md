I think it's fair to say I've had something of a chequered history with Tumblr. I've been here since the beginning of the platform, and have been both my own champion, and worst enemy - contributing slices of daily life, or vanishing for months or years.

Throughout the various incarnations of my "tumblog" I've forged friendships, occasionally crossed lines, agreed with many, disagreed with just as many more, and learned much about myself and others. I continue to be absorbed by the chaotic melting pot of stories, thoughts, ideas, and creativity that Tumblr has almost always supported so enthusiastically.

The cornerstone of my continued participation has centred around the words a good friend shared in the thick of the "me too" reckoning that brought a wrecking ball to the community so many thought they knew;

"Own your own shit"

The propensity for so many to share deeply personal or divisive thoughts, opinions and conjecture is a testament to the Tumblr platform, and it's power to encourage the acceptance of differences, freedom of expression, and spirited debate.

I have made mistakes along the way. I'm human.

I've found myself contributing to subjects I had no business expressing opinions about; fence sitting among those living with the very real effects of prejudice and intolerance. I learned the hard way about picking battles.

An old friend messaged me privately - "don't die on this hill".

These days I tend to watch from a distance, and just share my story. A quiet voice on the periphery. I sometimes wonder how those I once knew here are doing - if they are still out there somewhere, tilting at windmills.

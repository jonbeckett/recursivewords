For the last two hours I have been sitting in front of a computer with the intention of writing something. Instead I have tumbled down rabbit hole after rabbit hole around the internet - either researching stories on twitter to find out if they are true or not, trawling through wonderful comic book cover artwork, or talking to distant friends.

(Five minutes pass while I make a coffee - and I'm only too aware that this is yet another method of distraction from actually getting on with writing anything. At this point, I could probably apply to join the Olympic procrastination team).

It's already Sunday morning at the time of writing. Saturday vanished into history half an hour ago. In my book Sunday doesn't start until I wake up in the morning. I could quite cheerfully fall asleep right now, but the temptation to stay up and extend the weekend is ever present. It's a fools game of course - burning the midnight oil. I'll never learn.

I suspect I may have become immune to the effects of caffeine.

Perhaps a good book, and a quiet half hour might be just the thing though - a break from the screen, and the infinite rabbit holes of the internet.

p.s. I've canned the personal blog at Medium. I suppose this means I'm back.

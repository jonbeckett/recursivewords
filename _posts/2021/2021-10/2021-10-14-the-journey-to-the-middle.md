For the last several months I have been experimenting with Substack, Wordpress, Tumblr, and Medium - trying to figure out what works best for me.

Keeping a long story very short, I'm going to carry on with Medium, which I've been exploring for the last year. This doesn't mean my writing will vanish entirely behind a pay-wall - I'm keeping the blog posts "free" in a new publication called "Jonathan Wrote This" (https://medium.com/jonathan-wrote-this).

If you would like to continue reading about my idiotic adventures, but don't want to visit Medium, you can receive them by email via the link below:

For those that have followed my escapades here, commented, liked, and messaged along the way - I'm not entirely vanishing - you'll just see less swathes of inconsequential verbiage emanating from my account.

Good talk.

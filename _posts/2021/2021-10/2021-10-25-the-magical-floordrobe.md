The rest of the household are home at the moment - the schools are on "half term". You might think this would mean chaos, noise, arguments, and running battles throughout the house - and you would be wrong. I'm as surprised as you.

There must be a turning point with teenagers - where they turn from battle hardened procrastinators into somewhat reasonable family members. I say "somewhat", because I discovered an entire rugby kit stuffed behind the upstairs bathroom door earlier.

I'm pretty sure teenage girls think the workings of the floordrobe is a miracle of the natural world - where clothes magically vanish from whence they are thrown, walk themselves through the washing machine, dry themselves, fold themselves, and arrive ready to wear once again.

I guess the floordrobe works in exactly the same way as the fridge, and the kitchen food cupboards. By magic.

Don't even get me started with washing up.

I'm becoming increasingly fed up with being called upon to help others with stuff (outside of my direct family, obviously). While it feels good to be able to help, there comes a point where you just wish you had a little time to yourself, and wished others would take a bit of responsibility in learning how to do things for themselves.

I guess the real problem I have is those that take advantage of others. People who take, without giving back. It seems their entire existence is predicated on that which they can take from others, who they might use, and situations they might exploit.

Maybe my feelings are a natural "awakening", from the point of view of somebody that has always been independent, and largely self-taught - realising that some people don't so much "not know", as much as "have no intention of really learning".

I'm just tired. Tired of interacting with others when it's not really an interaction - it's a payment. I wish sometimes I was sought out just to see how I'm doing, rather than because somebody wants something from me.

Anyway. I'll stop complaining. At least complaining to nobody in particular gave me something to write about, right?

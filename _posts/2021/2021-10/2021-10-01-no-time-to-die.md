After work this evening I headed out with my other half to the cinema - we saw the new James Bond movie - "No Time to Die".

I liked it. It's probably worth noting that my bar to like movies is incredibly low though - I'm no movie snob. I'm not going to ruin the story at at all, so don't worry if you've not seen it yet.

There was a moment - halway through the movie - when I turned to my other half and grinned. Bond runs past a circular tunnel, and turns to shoot an enemy - towards the camera. We both spotted it. A reference to the classic Bond title image. Given that it was Daniel Craig's last outing as Bond, I wondered if it was put in to may a homage of sorts.

The bigger movie news for me today was the discovery that Steven Spielberg has been working on a re-make of West Side Story. I've always loved the music from West Side Story, and cannot quite describe how the trailer made me feel. I had hair standing up on my arms, and tears in my eyes - it looks *that* good.

Anyway. It's getting late. Time to fall into bed and sleep. Or sit in bed for an hour falling down internet rabbit holes in my phone. Not sure which yet.

Just before dinner this evening while finishing work, checking email, and taking a quick look at the various social sites I have accounts, I noticed Facebook was down. And Instagram. I grinned, raised an eyebrow, and went off to eat dinner with my family.

Five hours later, Facebook is still down.

On the evening news, people in the street were being interviewed about how the outage has impacted them. One young lady grinned at the camera, and reflected my thoughts - words to the effect of "the world might be a better place if Facebook didn't exist any more".

If you're wondering what's really going on, there seems to be some sort of problem in the "border gateway protocol" system at Facebook - the software machinery that receives requests for data and routes them through the most efficient routes.

Anyway.

Perhaps I'll go read a book before bed, and revel in the silence of no notifications, reminders, or friend requests.

Bliss.

One more day down. One day closer to Christmas. Things are starting to slow down at work, although a continual stream of meetings has succeeded in filling each day so far. More by luck than judgement my bullet journal has perhaps 10 pages left empty.

This morning I have been reminded why I use a paper notebook over a computer to keep track of what I need to get done each day. While computers are great at reminding me what's going on, they are pretty terrible at helping you remember what you did on a given day - not because they can't - more because the designers of the most common organisational apps obviously don't "eat their own dog food" - none of them let you see what you added, updated, or removed yesterday, or the day before.

I suppose if I updated my timesheet each day, I would have no need to look back. Who does that though?

My other half has asked for a bullet journal for Christmas to use at work. It should arrive in the post tomorrow (fingers crossed!). After experimenting with one last year and falling straight down the "pretty page design" rabbit hole, she's come around to my way of using them - strictly as a task list and journal of "things done". I have Ryder Carrol's book on the shelf - I imagine her nose will be in it over the new year period - it's full of useful tips and insights.

Anyway. I haven't been out in the fresh air for the last couple of days - perhaps I should switch my "out of office" on for an hour and go for a walk.

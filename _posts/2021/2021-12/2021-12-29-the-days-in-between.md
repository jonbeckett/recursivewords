If you're not working - which I'm not this year - the days between Christmas and New Year seem like a kind of vacuum - especially the last couple of years. With COVID rampaging around the community, nobody is going anywhere or doing anything. Days out have been put on hold, and visits to friends curtailed.

Thank the maker for the internet. What would we do without it? When I was young finding a book to read generally involved walking to the public library - which was only open during certain hours. These days we can download pretty much any book in moments to an inexpensive reading device, or even have it read to us.

I've never really got on with audio books. I'm not sure why. I can see why they appeal to some, but having grown up with paper books, there is a sort of eccentric romance to the feel and smell of them. I dare not tell you how many books we have littered around the house - letting go of any of them during mass clear-outs is always difficult.

My brother-in-law gave me an Amazon voucher for Christmas. I spent it on a number of ebooks that were "on offer" - books I've always wondered about, but never read. I'm already half-way through "Crash" by J G Ballard, with "A Clockwork Orange" and "One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest" waiting in the wings. I've always been fascinated by classic, banned, or notorious books. I guess curiosity gets the better of me - wanting to find out why their reputation precedes them.

Anyway.

Time to go find my book, and a quiet corner to lose myself for an hour. Rain is falling outside. There's very little else to do. I guess this is what most people call "recharging".

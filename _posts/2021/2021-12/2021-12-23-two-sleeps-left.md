One more day of work left. Two sleeps left. I can't imagine I'm going to get a lot done tomorrow, given that I'll then have the better part of 10 days off. Given events unfolding around the world, we're not going anywhere or doing much over the Christmas period - so if nothing else it will be a good chance to recharge.

I'm looking forward to getting out running again. It's been a while. I need to find my reflective coat - running in the dark at this time of year is pretty dangerous without it.

While writing this I'm waiting for the water filter to refill so I can make myself a coffee. We have to use a filter because our tap water has become terrible over the last year. If you scrub the kettle out, then fill it from the tap, and boil it, you can no longer see the bottom of the kettle. It started when they dug the town up to route fibre broadband. Quite why the kids cannot grasp the concept of re-filling the water filter after emptying it is anybody's guess. Probably the same reason they never find a new toilet roll, and put empty packets back in the cupboards.

On the subject of broadband, I put the application form in for fibre to our house this morning. Waiting has paid off - we're now going to get six months for free. We will leap from about 5Mbit up, and 20Mbit down to 400Mbit both ways. I can't imagine it will happen over the Christmas break, so it will be something to look forward to in the new year.

One more day of work left. We can do this.

The end of one year and the beginning of the next is often associated with the opportunity to make changes. Change to one's surroundings, one's self, or to set out on a journey of some description. After wandering through the online landscape mostly alone, and somewhat aimlessly for the past year, I've decided it's probably time to do something about it. Time to plan a journey of sorts.

It's so easy to fall into shadow. To become insular. To send your words out across the far reaches of the internet while not paying attention to the people and places they might reach.

One day you look around, and find that the intrepid band you once stood alongside while leaning into the teeth of the internet storm no longer exists. Friends become acquaintances. Acquaintances become memories.

Over the coming year I would like to journey back to the internet well that inspired so many of the memories I have cherished for so long. I have no illusions it will be difficult - I have no idea what I'm looking for along the way, or what I might find. The world has changed. Perhaps I have too.

Anyway.

Here's to the future, to old friends, and to adventures yet to come.

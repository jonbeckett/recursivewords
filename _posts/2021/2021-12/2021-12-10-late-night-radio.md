I've been learning something new over the last week. A technology, platform, and language that has been around for a few years, but that I've never crossed paths with before. It's been a near vertical learning curve. All consuming. For the last several evenings I've carried on late into the night because I was starting to make progress.

I'm not going to lie - there were times earlier in the week when I began to wonder what I was doing - digging an enormous hole for myself with no sign of a way out. A combination of tenacity, curiosity, and doggedness has seen the beginning of an understanding form. What began as a mountain of seemingly unsurmountable problems slowly gave way to small insights, flickers of understanding, and hour upon hour of research and experimentation.

I can see light at the end of the tunnel at last. A new skill.

I'm hoping this weekend will remain quiet. I'm pretty drained. I could do with some time to recharge - a walk to the park perhaps. A coffee alongside the river. Some down-time.

It just occurred to me that I've been sitting in silence for the last couple of hours - tinkering with this and that, and now writing these words.

(a minute passes while I dick around with my phone, and the enormous bluetooth speaker in the corner of the room)

Carli Simon is now singing "Nobody Does it Better", on some late night radio station. Perfect. Did you know she was married to James Taylor? Both ridiculously talented. I'm always surprised that so few people know who he is - until they hear one of his songs. I suppose he's a bit like Burt Bacharach, and Hal David - lots of people know their names from somewhere, but have no real clue just how many famous songs they were responsible for.

Anyway.

Time to go grab a drink.

Lionel Richie is singing "Stuck on You". I think I like this late night radio station.

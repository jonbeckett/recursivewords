Somehow a week has passed since the last blog post. I can't remember the last time that happened. I suppose I should really fall back on the John Lennon quote - "life is what happens while you're making other plans". I sometimes wonder if the quotes you commonly see attributed to various people are true - if they really said what people claim.

Anyway.

There's not much to report, which perhaps indicates why there have been no blog posts. Work has continued as it always does, the chores have continued as they always do, and our family is largely surviving from day to day as it always seems to. I sometimes wonder if there might be some value in inventing a time machine, travelling into the past, and telling myself "one day you will have a family, and will struggle to make ends meet for several years in a row - but don't worry - you'll always manage it somehow".

This morning my middle daughter took part in the 5K "Santa Fun-Run" around town, and then continued on to play rugby where she scored a try. I on the other hand stood in the cold to watch her run past while minding my younger daughter who is on crutches at the moment (long story - read the blog a few weeks ago). My other half wrapped up like an eskimo and waited in the park for middle daughter to finish the run. Our eldest holed herself up in the junk room at home playing a bizarre Manga inspired video game called "Catherine" about a guy having strange dreams about girls trying to kill him - or at least that's what I could make of it.

The clock just ticked past 10pm and I've switched the dishwasher on for the second time today. In a few minutes I'm loading the washing machine for the third time today. It just seems to be like this at the moment. I get a few minutes - usually after getting into bed - to catch up with friends inside my mobile phone.

Hopefully the world will slow down soon. I woke up the other morning with a stiff neck, and a book propped on my chest.

After a night of broken sleep - caused no doubt by the COVID booster injection I received yesterday afternoon - I got up this morning and set out on a rather important mission.

A little after 9am I entered the gates of the infant school in the centre of town, and was ushered through reception by the staff to a side room where a large bag awaited me. A large bag containing warm red clothes with white fur edging, an enormous belt, a huge floppy red hat with a white pom-pom on the end, enormous shiny black boots, a lustrous white beard, curly white hair, and a tiny pair of reading spectacles.

Five minutes later a member of staff returned to fetch the important guest, and the awaiting parent helpers gasped. Santa Claus himself had arrived in the school hall to take up position in a cosy armchair by the Christmas tree, surrounded by sacks of presents.

At this point the school fell into a well practiced routine that had been briefed several days previously. Santa Claus would be asleep in the chair, with an elf at his feet. The children of the infant school would assemble in the hall silently (to not wake him), and sing a Christmas song to wake him up.

Santa waited until the third line before rousing from my slumber, rubbed his eyes, blinked, and... oh my word. The power of several hundred young children's faces smiling is really quite special. One or two of them waved secretly - peeking out from behind friend's shoulders. Mr Claus waved back to delighted smiles.

Moments later there were sacks full of presents being handed to volunteers from each class - with very proud little ones marching forwards to receive them.

As the children filed back out to their classrooms they stole more smiles and waves - a steady stream of happiness, goodwill, and whispered excitement. After everything had died down, a young lady with special needs came forward to meet Santa on her own - hiding behind her teacher's legs, and peeking out after a few moments to wave.

You know the funny thing? When I agreed to take this on, I really wasn't sure about doing it. I don't find being the centre of attention easy. And yet it WAS easy, because I wasn't "me" - I was Santa Claus. I'm sure actors can write at length about hiding inside the part they are playing.

On the way home my daughter (who played an Elf, visiting from the North Pole with me) said:

"How did you do that Santa voice?"

"What do you mean?"

"Well it sounded just like Santa!"

"That's because it WAS Santa!"

A huge smile cracked across her face, and we carried on along our way.

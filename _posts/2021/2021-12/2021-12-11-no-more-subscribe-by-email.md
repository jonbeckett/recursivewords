If you have been receiving my blog posts via email, I'm afraid your regular updates are about to end. I had been using "Mailchimp" to deliver them recently, and unfortunately it looks like Mailchimp just got acquired by Intuit. I hate this aspect of American culture - the rampaging capitalism that eventually destroyes anything and everything that was once good.

Anyway.

No more email subs. Sorry.

At least Automattic (the owners of Wordpress) seem to have their head screwed on right. The formed a foundation years ago to protect the platform against just such eventualities. I guess the only problem there is "wordpress.com" is a separate entity than "wordpress.org" - essentially a business that operates on the back of the development of the platform.

It's tempting to run my own blog - away from external influence. It would have to run somewhere though, and of course that implies dependency on some corporate behemoth or other. There's no escape.

In other news, I just got a letter through the door inviting me to get a COVID booster. Within moments of opening the letter I had booked the appointment. Mid-afternoon this coming Wednesday. My other half just got back from having her booster shot done. The kids are scheduled over the coming weeks.

I'm continually amazed by the ass-hat conspiracy theorists that either maintain COVID is some sort of hoax, or that their freedom is more important than any consideration for anybody else.

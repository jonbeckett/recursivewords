I have a couple of hours left at work before I stop for Christmas. Of course "at work" is a bit of a stretch - I really mean "sitting in the junk room in front of the computer". I've been sitting here for eighteen months now.

I think perhaps of all the people I know, I was among the most suited to working from home. If I ever do pull the trigger and call Automattic about working for Wordpress, at least I know I'll have no problem with it.

(half an hour passes while I defuse an escalating argument with the kids)

Back again. I'm going to write a parenting guide book one day. It will probably have a single page, with some bullet points on it - among them:

1. You will always be wrong.

2. You will be accused of doing things you didn't do.

3. Very little you do will be appreciated.

4. Do your best.

5. Good luck.

That's about it really.

Anyway.

On a normal working day I would have commercial radio playing in the background, but virtually every station on the planet seems to be playing back-to-back Christmas songs at the moment. There's only so many times you can hear Perry Como before dark thoughts start to take over your world.

I signed up for a trial subscription to Amazon music a few moments ago - which will give me free music on-tap throughout the Christmas and New Year period. At the moment Lady Gaga and Tony Bennet are singing "Love for Sale". I just need to remember to cancel the subscription before they start billing me.

My other half has shut herself in our bedroom for the afternoon - trying to get the majority of the wrapping done to avoid the usual 1am panic. Fingers crossed. At least now the kids are getting older, the pile of presents for each is getting smaller. In truth, they don't really want for much, so presents have become a little more thoughtful, and useful. I was asked what I might like for Christmas, and apart from an instant reaction of "a day off", I just said chocolate. You can't go wrong with chocolate.

I think it's probably coffee o'clock. If I don't get chance after this to wish you good tidings, I'll do so now.

Merry Christmas, all the hugs, and best wishes for the coming year. May I find you happy and healthy on the flipside.

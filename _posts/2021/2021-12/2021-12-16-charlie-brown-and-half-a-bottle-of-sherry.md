It's a few minutes before midnight, and you find me sitting in the dark, drinking a glass of sherry, eating leftover crips, and listening to the Charlie Brown christmas movie soundtrack (which happens to be a pretty epic Jazz playlist).

I've been compiling a Christmas quiz for work for the last hour - stealing questions and answers from all over the place. I think it's more or less done now. I don't want the quiz to go on for too long, lest everybody get bored. Five rounds. Three question rounds, and two picture rounds inbetween. It will be delivered via a video call tomorrow.

An hour before the quiz I'm getting a COVID booster shot. Let's hope it doesn't affect me too badly. I have to dig my bike out and hot-foot it across town. I haven't got on my bike for months. I wonder if I can remember how to turn the pedals ?

This Charlie Brown soundtrack is kind of wonderful.

I wonder who provided the voices for Charlie Brown? Are they still alive? I remember watching a Youtube video of Nancy Cartwright (Bart Simpson) buying cookies from a scout doing fund-raising a while ago - he had no idea who she was, and still didn't catch on until she dropped completely into the Bart voice. It was kind of wonderful - watching the cogs turn in his head. She of course bought all of his cookies.

I love it when celebrities perform small acts that require little effort but illicit huge results (for the receiver). When they take time out to make others dreams come true. Not everybody gets lucky - not everybody is in the right place at the right time, or will ever be in the right place at the right time - and recognising that and paying it forwards is kind of wonderful.

Somehow there's nothing quite as powerful as watching a composed, sensible person ugly cry in front of the object of their affection. We're all just people really. For most of us, actors *are* the roles they play - in reality they are just as insecure, angry, happy, undecided, or broken as the rest of us.

Anyway. It's half past my bedtime now. Time to go brush my teeth, and claim I have no idea where half a bottle sherry went.

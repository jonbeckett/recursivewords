The end of the week draws near. Before getting started with the ritual unloading of mental baggage, I should perhaps tell a little more of the unknown parcel story. It turns out it wasn't unknown at all - a family member on the other side of the world sent me the enormous boombox that arrived earlier in the week as an unmarked birthday present. I can't imagine it will be long until the neighbours complain - our youngest daughter was sitting behind me in the junk-room earlier playing "her music" through it loud enough to make my insides vibrate.

I've been busy beavering away on a sort-of-secret work project this week. I need to have words with our middle daughter - I overheard her talking to somebody online, telling them exactly what I was working on. Not ideal. I suppose I should be grateful that our kids are so transparent - they haven't learned to be sneaky or underhand (yet), and haven't had to learn to deal with people who are. They have very few filters.

I haven't been running for weeks. I'm not really sure why. I need to do something about that - I've not set foot outside of the house for a couple of weeks. In the last six months the only places I have been are the supermarket, the corner shop, and the rubbish tip. I suppose I have been for a few runs, and a few walks - but that mostly involved avoiding as many people as possible.

My eldest daughter had her first coronavirus vaccine injection this morning. She's classed as being "at risk" due to being coeliac, so has jumped the queue. Apparently my age group will get vaccinated in a couple of months time. I can't quite believe how many people are avoiding the vaccines - choosing to believe stories they discovered online, rather than the advice of doctors and scientists that have studied and practiced their entire career. I suppose we still live in a society where the majority of people believe we were "created", rather than evolved though. I wonder how long that will take to change?

Anyway.

It's almost the weekend. Perhaps a cup of tea might fit the bill before putting my laptop away, and curling up on the couch with a book.

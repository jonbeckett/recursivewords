The weekend was pretty quiet. My other half was sick - the side-effects of the covid vaccine. She tends to get floored by colds, so it was no surprise she had such an adverse reaction. I'm hoping I'll be ok when my turn arrives. She has improved each day, and is back at work today.

In-between working I'm throwing load after load of washing through the machine, trying valiantly to burrow my way to the bottom of the washing baskets. You realise just how boring your life has become when the appearance of sunshine and wind makes you think "I could get quite a bit of washing dry today!".

I outmealed the Zack Snyder Justice League movie over the weekend. I'll be first in line to buy it when it's officially released - although very long, it's by far the best comic book movie so far. It's a huge shame that Warner Brothers have no interest in making any more. Henry Cavill is Superman. Ben Aflek is perhaps the best Batman there has been so far, and Gal Gadot is... well... she is Wonder Woman.

I do have some good news to share. My eldest daughter has a new job! She will be starting at the local outwards-bounds centre in a few weeks - helping with coordination, planning - that kind of thing. She'll initially be in charge of COVID measures. I imagine after Easter the world and it's dog will be itching to get back to "normal life", so activity places will suddenly be overrun. I'm hoping she enjoys it.

I think it's time to make a cup of tea.

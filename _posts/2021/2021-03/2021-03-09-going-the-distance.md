I've been picking away at some research and development work for the last couple of days - trying to get my head around some new technology - making head or tail of how it works, what it can do, and how best to use it. After spending the greater part of the day feeling like I was bashing my head against a brick wall, I finally started to make progress late in the afternoon - and ended the day with a working demonstration of something that had previously existed only as a doubtful question mark on a wish list.

Suffice to say after work finished I walked to the corner shop and bought a bottle of wine. I'm two glasses in, and thinking that any more will cause a headache. I'm SUCH a lightweight. I also bought chocolate bars for everybody.

Alison Moyet is playing on Spotify. Or Yazoo. I forget which single was released under which name. The next track up is "I Guess That's Why They Call It the Blues". I wonder how revered Elton John will be when he's no longer around? I have a suspicion he's given nowhere near as much credit as he deserves. Yes, he's been an asshole in the past, but he's admitted it.

I burst out laughing in the cinema watching Rocketman when Elton came out with the immortal line:

"I started acting like a c*nt in 1975, and just forgot to stop".

Anyway.

Today went well. I got chores done, washing done, clothes dried, and lots of work done - all in the absence of anybody else in the house. Actually - that's a lie. My eldest daughter was here, sitting on the lounge floor all morning playing "Animal Crossing" on the Gamecube. I got the old games machines out of the attic a few days ago - she's been re-living her childhood ever since.

The younger children went back to school today, and were full of stories at dinner time. We make a point of all sitting at the dining table together for dinner every night, and asking how each other's day went. Well - all except me. I've told the story before about why they don't ask about my day (along the lines of me starting to rabbit on about something technical, and then getting interrupted with "and that's why we don't ask what Dad did today").

Phil Collins just finished singing "Groovy Kind of Love", if you're interested. Mike and the Mechanics are about to sing "The Living Years".

I think it's time for a cuppa.

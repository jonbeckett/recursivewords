I'm struggling to stay awake. I was up at 3am. My other half had her first COVID injection yesterday, and woke up in the middle of the night shaking like a leaf. She's been in bed all day. Apparently the shivers and flu-like lethargy are the most common side effects of the vaccine, and it looks like she's been hit pretty bad. I bought lucozade, paracetamol, and soup to get her through the next 48 hours. I guess we'll see how it goes.

Miss 17 has got dinner planned already - potato waffles, baked beans, and chicken nuggets. Not exactly the most healthy dinner ever, but nobody is going to complain.

The builders finished yesterday - we finally have a presentable house. We are no longer the slightly tatty looking house in the corner of the green. I can't call it "The Burrow" any more (the Weasley's house from the Harry Potter books). We just need to pay the bill now. There's a part of me that feels sorry for the birds that had been attempting to set up home in the eaves, but I also know there will no longer be any strange noises coming from the roof in the early hours of the morning.

I'm hoping this weekend will be quiet. A weekend filled with movies, books, and music. As the world wakes up, there are already rumblings about rugby practice - we need to enjoy the quiet while it still exists.

It's nearly midnight on Friday night as I begin writing this post. I'm sitting in the dark of the junk room, typing this into the desktop computer. My other half is watching television in the lounge, and the kids are fast asleep.

It's been a strange week. A week filled with research, investigation, head scratching, chores, learning, struggling, and not getting anywhere particularly quickly.

Late yesterday one of my co-workers messaged me, asking "what do you have planned in the morning?". Following a back-and-forth exchange of messages we met up at another co-worker's house this morning. Three McDonalds breakfast rolls, and three cappuccinos. After spending so many weeks working in solitude it was great to see them face-to-face.

I'm not really sure what the weekend will bring. I'm hoping to go for a run first thing in the morning, and will try to get my eldest daughter to go with me. On Sunday there is a social at the rugby club - an "end of the season that never was" barbecue. Other than that, not much else.

Anyway. It's gone midnight. Time to go fall asleep with a book propped on my chest. Again.

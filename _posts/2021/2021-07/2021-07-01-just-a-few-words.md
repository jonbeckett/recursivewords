A little voice has been whispering in my ear for the last few days that I've not posted anything to the blog - so I'm doing something about it. My fingers are flashing across the keys, and letters are appearing on the screen, but I wouldn't say my brain is entirely engaged in the process.

You know how you can get home from work without really thinking about the route, or anything that happens along the way? That probably applies to my writing - certainly to the words that appear in the personal blog entries.

This week I have more or less confirmed that I'm living inside a video game or television show - surrounded by non-player-characters, or actors. The only thing I'm not really sure of is if I'm starring in the show, or a glitch of sorts - a non player character that malfunctioned.

While walking into town with my eldest daughter we burst out laughing while waiting to cross a formerly deserted road. On our approach, at least ten cars appeared from nowhere. We were tempted to sit at the side of the road and wait - to see if we could trigger them again, or watch them repeat the pattern again.

At lunchtime today I wandered into town on my own - lost in a podcast being broadcast into my earholes. I needed to buy something easy for dinner, given that my other half is helping to shepherd a "whole school trip" to a far flung destination and back. I imagine she will be wiped-out by the end of the day.

On my way back from town I passed a very deliberate looking man, striding towards me. He was wearing short shorts, and a skin tight t-shirt. He was also about fifty years old, was was just a little too out of shape to get away with the t-shirt. The 1980s policeman sunglasses really didn't help.

I'm back "working" today. Furlough has ended. Project work starts in earnest tomorrow afternoon, so today has been about catching up and clearing the decks. The bullet journal is on the desk next to me, covered in scrawl for the first time in a while. Busy is good.

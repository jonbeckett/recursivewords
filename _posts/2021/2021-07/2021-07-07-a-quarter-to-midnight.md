The clock is ticking towards midnight, and you find me sitting in the dark of the study, tapping away at the keyboard while a random playlist on Spotify tries to convince me I'm sitting in the bar of a hotel in Paris, swishing the remains of my drink around in the bottom of a glass and watching the bar staff slowly bringing their day to a close.

I have nothing new to share - I'm not going to let that stop me though. If there's one thing I've learned about this damn fool blogging escapade, it's that you don't need to have very much to say. Quiet posts often seem more truthful than keyboard crusader manifestos.

I made ham sandwiches for lunch today because they were easy. Two pieces of bread, olive spread, pre-cut ham, and a little mustard. I finished making them before the kettle boiled water for yet another coffee.

I'm running in the morning. The "Couch to 5K" idiocy has reached week six, and I'm wondering about going off-piste; just going for "a run". At this point I don't really see much value in the programme. I'll see how I feel in the morning.

The clock just ticked into tomorrow. I'm pretty good at pretending tomorrow doesn't arrive until I wake up in the morning. I'm also good at not reading much any more - I have a stack of books on my bedside table that have been there for months - several half read, several never opened.

I need to make time. Time to read, to watch TV, and to catch up with distant friends. It's been too long.

I have spent nearly all day in meetings - one meeting after another. I don't think I could ever be a project manager, because their life seems to consist purely of meetings, calls, and gantt charts. Being a software developer suits me down to the ground - I get to obsess over my own little world of code, bits and bytes, and pretty much shut off from the rest of the world.

I've been humming "Video Killed the Radio Star" all day, after YouTube suggested a video of the band "Buggles" re-forming to perform it. YouTube has been knocking it out of the park recently - suggesting some amazing time-wasting procrastination aids to me. Perhaps the best musical performance has to be "A Whiter Shade of Pale", by Procol Harem - google the live performance in Denmark, 2006.

Anyway.

Time to sleep.

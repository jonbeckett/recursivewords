In-between juggling work, chores, and all manner of distractions earlier, I decided to go back to what I had planned to do in the first place, and just have a blog at Tumblr. Tumblr is easy. Tumblr is simple. Tumblr just lets you post stuff without really worrying about it too much.

Alongside the blog backtracking, I re-installed Manjaro Linux on the old laptop - mostly to turn it into an internet radio. It's wired up to the boombox in the corner of the study, playing music from the 80s as I write this.

Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go collapse into bed. I'm going to be up at 5:30am again in the morning to accompany my youngest daughter on her paper round (unless my other half takes a turn at it). Wish us luck. For most people, a paper round would be trivial - for our youngest it's pretty challenging for all sorts of reasons.

I might go grab some supper.

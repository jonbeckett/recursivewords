The clock has just passed 1:30am. I don't know why I'm still awake. I've spent the majority of the evening deep in virtual rabbit holes. The internet is a perfect escape for a master procrastinator.

Tomorrow (or later today), we head out to watch our younger daughters play rugby. I'm pretty sure my role will involve pouring tea from a flask, and shouting encouraging things.

That's all I have at the moment. Hardly inspiring, is it. It seems these days I do no more than exist. I try to keep in touch with one or two people, but even that has become a struggle.

If a school teacher was passing comment on "me" at the moment, they would probably write "must try harder".

I'm still here though, still turning the pedals, still placing one foot down in front of the other each day. Each day is much like the last, but I keep going. Keeping going seems to be the solution to an awful lot of things at the moment.

I have coffee, cake, music, and an incense stick is filling the room with nice smells. Work is still relatively quiet - at least compared the headless rush of the last few years. Sometimes quiet is good.

I wandered into town with my eldest daughter at lunchtime. I'm pretty sure she was trying to break the "world's slowest walk into town" record - every time I slowed to let her catch up, she slowed even futher. I watched other people walking briskly past us with envy.

After picking up some groceries and somehow drawing a short straw to make dinner, we looked around the bookshop before heading home. Quite miraculously I didn't buy a book. I'm getting better at that.

I finally started reading "The Midnight Library" the other evening. I'll let you know what I think when I've got a bit further into it.

In other news I'm drinking black coffee for the first time in a while. A jar of espresso has been sitting in the corner of the kitchen cupboard for months - time to do something about it.

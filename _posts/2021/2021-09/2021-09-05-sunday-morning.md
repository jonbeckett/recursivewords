It's  been a few days since I wrote anything in the blog. Life seems to have a way of diverting me from anything and everything at the moment. This morning has been a good example - I started writing this post three hours ago; along the way the washing machine, the washing line, the rubbish bins, the kitchen, the dishwasher, and numerous other things got in the way.

I'm about to walk away, after managing to write one paragraph in three hours, to make some lunch. Perhaps I'll just carry on writing - while listening to my teenage daughters arguing while making their own lunches. Their natural state seems to be some sort of argument.

My eldest daughter appeared from her room yesterday looking pale, and announced that she might be in trouble. After calming her down, we spent half an hour trying to get her to understand the way banks operate - and that when they tell you "your current account is about to become overdrawn", it's just a case of covering the debt from your savings account (we set her up with two accounts, but now we realise she doesn't understand at all).

I ended up asking her to imagine that banks have two people working in them - one that writes down every transaction you perform, and another that actually *performs* the transactions - and the person that performs them is slow (we all know the reality - that banks are businesses, and they hold your money for a few days to use for their own reasons). I think she understood in the end.

I'm tinkering with a Blogger incarnation of this blog on the quiet. A further retreat from the internet at large. Blogger has no walled garden - it never has had. Sure, it's a bit clunky, but all I ever do is post a few words. I'll let you if it goes anywhere.

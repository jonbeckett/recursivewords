A pretty ridiculous story has been unfolding in the UK this week. One I thought I might write a few words about for the entertainment and amusement of international readers who might want something to read while they sip their coffee.

Towards the end of last week, owing to a few logistics problems, one of the major fuel suppliers in England put out a press-release that they would have to close some of their gas stations for a few days. The media - scratching around for some muck to fling (because lets face it, that's what most breathless 24 hours news cycle reporting has been reduced to) discovered the story and added various spectacular adjectives to it in order to meet web traffic targets.

Within 24 hours, millions of idiots had begun panic-buying fuel up and down the country. Given that not many people own more than one car each, and there's only so many fuel cans and coke bottles you can fill with gasoline, petroleum, or diesel until you accidentally burn your house down, all predictions pointed towards a healthy supply chain returning everything to normal pretty quickly.

Only things got worse quickly.

Following a number of factors that various sides of the media like to either trumpet or bury, the fuel delivery supply chain throughout the UK has ended up running with little or no slack in the system. Depending on who you ask and their political leanings, this has been blamed on the UK leaving Europe, the BBC, low wages, the laziness of others, corporate greed, and every other reason you could possibly imagine.

If you put your fingers in your ears, ignore social media, and try to read a cross-section of reports from trustworthy industry sources, you discover that long distance haulage has been in decline in the UK for decades. Skilled drivers have retired faster than newly qualified drivers have come up. And yes, many tens of thousands of skilled drivers with appropriate training and certification to carry fuel left the UK when we left Europe. The reasons listed by researchers for low numbers of new drivers coming through have included low wages, lack of career progression opportunities, being away from home a lot, and work life balance.

Everybody seems to have nothing better to do than complain about the millions of idiots panic buying fuel, the media for causing the panic, or the politicians for not being clairvoyant enough to see the disaster coming.

There seems to be very little accountability going on.

If there were less petrol or diesel powered cars on the road we would need less fuel. If haulage was a more sustainable career, more people would do it. If supply chains were not micro-managed towards maximum efficiency, spikes in demand would become manageable. If we hadn't left Europe's gang, we would still be able to employ skilled drivers for less than the market rate to prop up a failing industry...

Oh. Wait.

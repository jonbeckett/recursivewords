Where did Tuesday and Wednesday go? Can we go out and look for them? I vaguely remember them happening, but I'm not really sure.

I sit within the four walls of this room each day, and slowly lose touch with the outside world. After dinner this evening - scratching around for a reason to go for a walk, I asked if we needed any groceries. Town is a mile away - fifteen minutes walk - far enough to clear your mind. My younger daughter accompanied me, along with a shopping list and an old hessian bag.

We didn't talk much while walking. Sometimes you don't need to. My daughter held my hand for much of the way. She's sixteen. I sometimes wonder if she'll always hold my hand, or if it will become un-cool at some point.

Late last night I started binge-watching "Upload" - a dark comedy on Amazon Prime about a technology in the future that allows your conscience to be uploaded to a virtual world shortly before your death; so that you may live on. While much of it is typically shallow US wise-cracking humor, there is some great commentary about culture, values, and the erosion of society. I'm enjoying it.

Now if you'll excuse me, I think I can hear the kettle boiling...

After what seems like weeks chasing my own tail, the world is slowing down a little - affording the chance to take stock and work out how to move forwards, rather than continually stumble and scramble.

I accompanied my youngest daughter once again on her paper round this morning. She's improving every day - making fewer mistakes, and getting faster. My other half has drawn the short straw to accompany her in the morning - following that, we will let her get on with it herself. Sink or swim time.

I don't think I'll ever get used to the late-afternoon tiredness that comes with getting up before 6am.

One of the huge benefits of working from home is being able to listen to music all day. I used to listen to Spotify, but in recent weeks have been listening to streaming radio stations instead. I tend to choose retro stations playing 80s and 90s music - perhaps because that's what I grew up listening to. I love the new Abba singles.

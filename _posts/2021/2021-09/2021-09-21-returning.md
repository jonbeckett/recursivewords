After a month spent hiding in a quiet corner of the Tumblrverse, I suppose these words signal a return to normality of sorts. A return to the madding crowd - or the periphery of it at least.

A good friend messaged me this morning while I dithered about back-filling journal entries from the recent past - "you're allowed to change your mind".

In a somewhat connected turn of events, I wandered into Twitter last night, stood on a chair, and looked around. For the last year or so I've only followed a handful of accounts - bloggers, and close friends. After an hour of quite spectacular undecided hand-wringing, I began searching out new voices. Some thoughtful publications, influential thinkers, and old friends. Before setting off into the rabbit hole, I commented to a friend that Twitter was a slippery slope - and so it proved to be. By midnight I found myself sitting in bed, lit by my phone screen, following a hundred more feeds than I had earlier in the evening.

While scrolling Twitter, I began to understand it's attraction. Life - in all it's forms - distilled to it's essence. When you only have a few words to communicate your thoughts, the baggage tends to get cast off. I found myself absorbed in all manner of victories, losses, births, deaths, thoughts, debates, dreams, hopes, happiness, anger, and everything in-between.

Anyway.

I'm back. I suppose in some ways I was never really gone.

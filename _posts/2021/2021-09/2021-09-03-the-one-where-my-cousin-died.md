My cousin died yesterday morning. The one who's wedding I went to two weeks ago. The wedding was wonderful, but it was pretty obvious he didn't have long left. I'm guessing we'll be returning a lot sooner than we thought for the funeral.

When we were children he visited our house every Thursday night with his Mum. We would play with LEGO together, ride bikes around the neighbourhood, and climb trees.

When I was in infant school I made friends with a boy with the same name - who moved away to the same village as my cousin. They became best friends.

They are both gone now.

I'm not sure how I feel about losing people around me. It seems like so many of my secondary school year have gone now. I don't think of myself as that old. I suppose nobody does.

I'm getting a little too good at "not writing" at the moment. It's easy to say there are too many distractions, when the reality is that I'm just not setting aside time to write anything. Life is happening around me.

This week was pretty brutal. During the first half of the week I somehow managed to fit three days work into two - getting up with my youngest daughter who headed out on her newspaper round each morning at 6am, and working straight through to the evening. Sometimes work projects stack up, and there's no alternative but to just knuckle down.

The coming week is looking a little easier - although the early mornings will continue. Our youngest struggled a little with her paper-round this week - I'll accompany her for a few days - more as reassurance than anything.

If nothing else, getting up early and getting on the bike will be good for me. I've not been running for a while, after one of my knees started hurting. Cycling on a morning will hopefully put some strength back into my legs. It's probably worth remembering that I used to cycle at least six miles every day to get to the office and back. Maybe I need to figure out a quiet route that covers a similar distance.

Anyway.

I just wanted to take the chance to say a huge thankyou to those of you out there that have reached out to me recently - to ask how I am - to share a little of your world with me. It means the world to have a small circle of friends dotted around the world. Sure, we're not in each other's faces every day, or every week, but we somehow persist the unlikely friendships we have forged.

Here's to unlikely friends.

The radio is filling the room with "Black Velvet" by Alanah Miles. I remember when it first appeared, and VH1 played it to death. Who remember VH1? I'm guessing it arose in Europe after MTV went past the curious tipping point where their schedule was filled with reality TV shows rather than music videos. I've written about the era when their "VJs" became famous - the likes of Ray Cokes, and Marijne van der Vlugt. I remember getting in from college and decompressing in front of their shows.

I guess streaming has replaced broadcast music channels. Anybody can play or watch anything they like, when they like, wherever they like. The world has changed.

I sometimes wonder how discovery works now. Does new music only reach people's ears via algorithms? The various streaming services are paid to promote artists and songs - nobody walks into a music store and flips through the vinyl albums any more.

I just switched from the radio to YouTube.

I tend to either listen to 80s pop radio stations, podcasts, or music streamed from a variety of YouTube channels (invariably filled with instrumental Jazz). The jazz tends to turn the world around me into a Charlie Brown movie - filled with melancholy, serendipity, and thoughtfulness.

Anyway.

I'm supposed to be getting on with some work. Or make a coffee. I've not decided which yet.

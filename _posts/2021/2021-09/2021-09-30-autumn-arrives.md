Autumn has arrived with a vengeance. Over the course of the last week the temperature has dropped, wind and rain has arrived, and the nights are drawing in fast. Suddenly coats, scarves, and boots seem like a good idea when venturing out for any length of time.

Leaves have begun turning yellow and falling from the trees surrounding the house. The cats have retreated indoors after a spring and summer spent hunting and sleeping in the garden.

I'm holed up in the junk room with my work laptop, as always. Project work has slowed a little, which allows for some much needed research and development - for the same project, but looking ahead to future requirements.

(five minutes pass while I find a hoodie from upstairs, after realising I'm quite cold)

A slightly ragged bullet journal is propped on the corner of the desk - filled with nine months worth of tasks, notes, and doodles. I'm just trying to think back - is this my third bullet journal ? I think it might be. The rest are squirrelled away in a bag along with moleskine notebooks stretching back to the mid 2000s.

I started a hand-written journal while commuting into and out of London with work. For the better part of two years I left the house before the sun came up, and returned home after the sun had gone down. I remember emptying my thoughts into the notebook while squashed on trains, and while sitting alone in parks and cafes in the city.

Perhaps it's time to start looking at notebooks once again - especially as the elastic closer on my long suffering Moleskine notebook has given up the ghost.

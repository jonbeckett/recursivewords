It turns out slowing down is difficult after several weeks chasing your own tail. I finally have time to take a step back - to take stock - to figure out how I'm doing things. I don't find it easy to rush head-long into the next thing.

Years ago I read all manner of books about productivity, and tried out lots of the fashionable  things like the "Getting Things Done" methodology. It's all bollocks.

In other news, for some strange reason the HR manager where I work emailed me this morning and congratulated me for working for the company for 20 years. This is all slightly odd, because the 20 year mark passed in April (as far as I recall). Work has given me some restaurant vouchers - easily enough to take my entire family out.

"Re-write the Stars" is playing on the radio. I think that's what it's called - the song from "The Greatest Showman". I'm going to end up humming it all afternoon now.

Oh, look at the time. It's coffee o'clock.

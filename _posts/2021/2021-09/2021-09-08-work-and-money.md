As of this evening, my younger daughters have both entered the world of work. If you had told me this even a month ago, I wouldn't have believed you.

Miss 16 has taken to her newspaper round like a duck to water - getting out of bed at 6am each day, and delivering her "round" with an eye on the money she will earn at the end of the week. We worry about her the most because she has a number of challenges when compared to others her age - but she's doing well. Tomorrow she will head off single handed, and we will stay behind worrying.

Miss 17 started work at a pub in town this evening, waiting tables and learning the ropes. She came home full of stories about the evening, the people she had served, and the staff she worked alongside. Although only a "tryout session", she was offered the job at the end of the night and grabbed it with both hands. If there's one thing Miss 17 can do better than most, it's work hard and continue working hard. She will do well.

It's strange really - after spending so long being most of the kids universe, they are slowly engineering us out of their lives. In some ways it's a huge relief, but in others it's a worry. I guess all parents go through the same mental gymnastics. I suppose all you can do is hope you've prepared them well enough for the world.

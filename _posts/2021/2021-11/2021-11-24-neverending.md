As the clock ticks past 11pm I've cracked open the programming text editor I've been using for the last several months to write blog posts. I guess when it comes to emptying my head, my brain works best when distractions are removed. If all I can do is type, I don't get distracted by typefaces, line spacing, or anything else. It's just me and the words.

Some time ago I experimented with turning my laptop into a computer from the 1980s running Wordstar. It's amazing how much more you can concentrate without a multi-tasking operating system offering the possibility of listening to music, browsing the web, reading emails, and countless other very important distractions.

Anyway.

Today was something of a slog.

From the moment Alexa began filling the bedroom with radio early this morning it felt like I was walking out to bat over, and over again. Here's hoping the rest of the week gets a little easier.

Time to go brush my teeth and fall into bed. Perhaps a few pages of a book first.

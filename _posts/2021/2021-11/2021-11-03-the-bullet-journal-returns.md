After several weeks experimenting with all manner of technologically sophisticated productivity solutions, I retreated back to a paper bullet journal tonight. There's just something about writing things down on paper that helps stick them in my head.

It's not like I write things down to plan far ahead either - I'm not that clever. I just write things down that I need to do, and mark them as done, so I know what I did on a given day when somebody asks (cough, when I need to fill my timesheet out, cough).

I guess the thing I've learned is not to use a bullet journal to record notes - which sounds utterly mad. Notes can go on the computer, and be made searchable. No - the bullet journal just has a list of bullets that get ticked off (or not) throughout the day.

My bullet journal is a mindfulness crutch. A sticking plaster for my occasionally terrible short term memory.

I wonder if my inability to hold onto things I read a few seconds ago is related to my inability to juggle? It makes no sense, because I can recall all sorts of things that I don't need to - old phone numbers, passwords, and all sorts of trivia.

Anyway.

I better drink the coffee I made a few minutes ago. It's going cold.

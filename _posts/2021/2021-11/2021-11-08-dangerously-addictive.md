It's been five days since the last blog post. How does that even happen?

I'll tell you how it happens - you install a ridiculous video game where you pretend you're the captain of a star ship, and you jump from planetary system to planetary system buying and selling goods, taking on contracts from pretend people, going sight-seeing, and pretty much living the second life you will not live long enough to see happen.

You then discover an underground of software developers that have written all manner of integrations with the underlying mechanics of the game to open up it's beating heart - allowing you to essentially perform "insider trading" within the machinery of the pretend universe - buying and selling at huge profits. Before you know it, you've upgraded your white van to a container ship - hauling thousands of tons of contraband half-way across the galaxy while avoiding just the sort of villainy depicted in Star Wars.

The game is called "Elite Dangerous".

So yes. That's why I've not written a blog post. That's also why I tend not to play "role playing" video games - because I know myself, and know what will cause my world to stop turning.

I've always stayed away from "World of Warcraft" for the same reason. I still smile when I recall my other half picking up the box for a game similar to World of Warcraft in a computer superstore many years ago (back when computer superstores still existed), and pointed out that it came with "free boots of infinite striding".

Anyway.

It's lunchtime. Time to go make a sandwich, and NOT waste my lunchtime in the damn star ship, no matter how tempting it might be.

Every so many months I find myself retracing paths I have walked before. Repeating decisions. Revising judgement. Changing my mind one way or another. Becoming brave and then not so brave. Stepping out, and retreating.

It's all very perplexing.

A girl I used to work with found my changes of heart amusing. She connected them to the seasons. I seem to be retreating at the moment. Falling into shadow. Perhaps she was right - the weather has grown cold in recent days - frost has arrived, leaves are falling, and I'm becoming increasingly insular.

At times interacting with the world feels like such a struggle - a battle I have to wage with myself in order to write emails, reply to messages, post to the blog, or share happenings of note.

I'm not really sure I have a point to relate. I'm just sharing the way I feel at the moment. At least if you don't see much from me you'll understand why.

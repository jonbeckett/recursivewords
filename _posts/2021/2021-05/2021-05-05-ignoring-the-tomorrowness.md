May the fifth be with you. Doesn't sound quite as good, does it. At the time of writing it's eight minutes past midnight, so I suppose it's already tomorrow. The sixth. Perhaps I'll ignore the tomorrowness of it all, and pretend it's still tonight.

I have a somewhat important conference call tomorrow morning. I should really be asleep already - recharging my batteries in order to appear somewhat cogent while sipping coffee in front of the laptop webcam.

The draw of the internet rabbit hole is strong. Oh, the hours I could spend reading about subjects of little consequence to me. Last night I found myself reading about the Trinity nuclear tests at midnight. I'm not sure why.

There seems to be an event horizon in the internet rabbit hole, beyond which all manner of interesting yet unknown distractions lurk.

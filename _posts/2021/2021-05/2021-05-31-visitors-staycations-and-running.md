The sun is setting on a busy day. I'm sitting in the junk room, trying to gather my thoughts while sipping a cup of black coffee, and listening to a "Paris Caf(c)" playlist on Spotify. I've just pulled on a zipped hoodie - combating the after-effects of having caught the sun earlier in the day.

My in-laws visited today. My brother-in-law brought power-tools to help construct a raffia fence along the edge of the garden. My mother-in-law accompanied him to oversee operations, and to watch the tennis at Roland Garros with me (or at least, when I wasn't cutting the grass, washing up, or washing up some more).  We bonded over running injuries today - I showed her the lump on my achilles tendon, and she showed me her ankle - which apparently hurt, but looked fine. Thankfully my rugby playing daughters were not present, or it might have turned into a pop-up meeting of hypochondriacs anonymous.

While writing this, a Frenchman is expertly playing an accordian in quite the most wistful manner you might ever imagine. He has given way to a crooner singing about some disaster of the heart or other - I can't understand a word of it, so can only imagine the subject of his anguish. Perhaps his girlfriend didn't share her peanut M&Ms with him? (I would have been distraught too)

Anyway.

I have the week off work.  The possibilities of how to spend the coming days are many, but I fear procrastination may defeat almost all of them. It's not that I'll waste my time off - I'll find all manner of interesting things to do - I just won't get around to many of the things I should perhaps have been doing. It's interesting how the most mundane rabbit holes become increasingly interesting when faced with doing anything productive instead.

The one thing I will do during the week is run. As mentioned a few days ago, I've re-started the "Couch to 5K" programme - partly to support a good friend, and partly to avoid my backside establishing it's own gravitational force. I'm hoping that "Park Run" will be back up and running in the autumn - it will give me something to aim for - and something to do each weekend. If you've not heard of it, it's a pretty common international movement where parks organise 5K runs for all abilities - usually on a Saturday morning. You register on the park run website, get a barcode, and off you go. You can of course buy all manner of "official" merchandise - such as wristbands or waterbottles - or just print out the barcode and tuck it in your sock. Lots of people do.

I guess the attraction of doing an organised run is both to run in a group - where you get swept along by the crowd - and to have medical people on-site, should anything unfortunate happen - you know, like the town finding out you have no running talent. I'm pretty sure the town know I have no running talent, having seen me trudging the streets over the last few years - that's not the point of running though.

There's probably really good research on the huge release of endorphins after running. It's hard to explain - you often feel like absolute garbage during a longer run - especially if pushing out to a longer distance - but afterwards a huge wave of euphoria sweeps through you. Body chemistry is an amazing thing.

I'm trying not to read the news. The news is full of stories about the Indian variant of the coronavirus going on something of a rampage, and causing brakes to perhaps be put on the slow journey out of lockdown we had all been on. It doesn't take a genius to figure out how the variant arrived here - until recently travel to and from India was allowed if you had good enough reason. It's all rather depressing really.

It's interesting really - that while the modern world has become so much smaller through the development of affordable methods of travel, it has also ensured that viruses can spread throughout the planet in days or weeks.

In-between working and doing chores, I've been tinkering with an old computer at home - or rather, a simulation of an old computer. There is an old laptop sitting on the desk opposite me, suffering from a multiple-personality disorder. It's running an "emulator" - which transforms it into a Commodore Amiga - a computer that most people haven't seen for the better part of twenty five years. Don't ask me why I'm tinkering with it. I don't really know.

The blog seems to have taken a back-seat in recent days. I'm not really sure why. I tend to go through phases with writing - sometimes I have all manner of ideas, thoughts, or stories to communicate - and then sometimes I have nothing at all.

Anyway.

I have nothing to report today. No great news. Nothing of note has happened. I'll shut up before I single-handedly induce narcolepsy in enough people for "big data" to expose me as a danger to civilised society. "Most boring man in known universe becomes danger to others".

I'm sitting in the study (read: the junk room). Rain is gently falling outside, and I have jazz playing in the background once again. Through the wonders of Spotify and bluetooth, I have discovered how to choose music on the computer, and have it automagically burst from the boombox. I'm sure the neighbours are not happy about this, given the New York jazz band now causing the walls to gently vibrate to a bossa nova rhythm.

I've changed my mind about Ally McBeal. I'm expecting Audrey Hepburn to tip her head around the door at any moment, wearing her latest boyfriend's work shirt, and carrying a black cat under her arm. There's something about this music - it transports you to a time and a place in your memory.

Anyway.

We just got back from visiting the zero-waste store in town - our kitchen and pantry now look very much like they might fit in at Hogwarts - with glass mason jars filled with all manner of goodies lined up along the shelves and counters.

The store is a genius idea - you arrive with empty containers, weigh them, fill them with whatever you want, weigh them again, and only pay for the weight of whatever you have chosen - no packaging involved. We typically get most of our dry cooking ingredients from them - everything from pasta, to beans, lentils, and all manner of "healthy" snacks. I think my favourite in recent weeks has been dried chilli chick-peas. Or maybe almonds coated in cocoa.

Now if you'll excuse me, I have a reading list on Wordpress a mile long to catch up with.

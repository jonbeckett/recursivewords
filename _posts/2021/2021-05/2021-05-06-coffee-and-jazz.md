It's late on Thursday evening, and I'm listening to jazz on the internet while sipping coffee. I'm going to blame Claudette. She tipped me off about a YouTube channel filled with coffee house jazz, and I fell straight down an impressively deep internet rabbit hole.

Who knew I liked jazz? Does this mean I'm getting old? My late father in law had a huge collection of jazz music - we went with him on river cruises with jazz bands on-board several times over the years.

Jazz reminds me of Ally McBeal. I think perhaps it's the 90s Vonda Shepard back-catalogue that's been lurking in my subconscious recently - secretly burrowing it's way in via a steady stream of Spotify sleepy afternoon playlists.

In my mind - no doubt heavily influenced by movies, television shows, and old vinyl records heard from a distance - jazz is the soundtrack for New York, rain, wistfulness, and melancholy. The music of broken dreams, sadness, and loss.

I like melancholy. I like peace and quiet. I like music you don't really have to concentrate on - that's just kind of there in the background - tugging at an emotion, or a feeling. An old friend that's in the room with you, but you don't have to make conversation with.

Anyway.

It's almost 1am again. This late-night head emptying is turning into a habit.

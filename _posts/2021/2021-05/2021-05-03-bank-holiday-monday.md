It's heading towards 10am, and I'm still the only person up and about at home. It's a bank holiday in the UK today - many people have the day off work. Of course the weather isn't cooperating - while the sun is trying to break through at the moment, it's forecast to begin raining at lunchtime, and get worse throughout the day. I imagine our house will begin floating away by dinner time. I better start fashioning some oars out of household implements later.

I'm struggling to wake up. I'm not sure why, because I slept like a log last night - and half remember a couple of crazy dreams. One of them involved accidentally transferring thousands into one of my daughter's bank accounts, and then struggling to transfer the money back again before anybody found out. I wonder what that means?

It's interesting how the most illogical events or actions become reasonable in dreams.

(many hours pass)

The better part of the day was spent pulling ivy from the shed in the garden, helping my middle daughter create a podcast (for her college course), and doing several runs to the rubbish tip. This morning's weather forecast was wrong - the rain finally began to fall early this evening. It's still raining now, and looking pretty much like the world might end.

After washing up this evening I checked my phone, and saw messages from several friends, sent hours earlier. Hopefully they will understand that life occasionally tramples all over me. It seems that "having friends", "working", "doing chores", and "being a part of a family" never quite add up - and "having friends" always seems to be the first thing to fall by the wayside.

I saw a quote the other day from somebody famous (I forget who), noting that if you got run over by a truck tomorrow, your employer would replace you within a month or two - but that your friends and family would always remember you. I read it, and thought "yes, but if you don't work, you have no money, your family lose their house, and you have no smartphone to stay in touch with friends".

Nothing is ever as simple as a motivational quote.

Anyway. I only have a few hours until the "day off" comes to an end. I should probably go watch something rubbish on the television, and eat something I'll feel bad about afterwards. It's funny how that works.

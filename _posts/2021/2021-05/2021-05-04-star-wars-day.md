May the fourth be with you. Apparently today is "Star Wars Day". It's all a bit thtupid really, ithn't it. Thee what I did there?

Anyway.

What news might I have to impart? Perhaps that I'm back using the bullet journal again. My attempt to weld myself to mobile productivity apps lasted all of one weekend. It turns out - for me at least - there really is nothing better than a piece of paper and a pen. Of course the productivity ninjas will probably start wittering on about there being bullet journals and bullet journals, and will reference their own expertly photographed double page spreads of yoga mornings, boutique lunch appointments, and zen afternoon wellbeing meetups.

Idiots.

My bullet journal is an embarrassment to bullet-journal-kind. Each day has a list of things I wanted to get done, and things I did. That's it. That's as clever as it gets. Sure, I can't search it without flipping backwards through it, but it's not like it takes very long to find a password I shouldn't have written in it in the first place.

Sure, I could fill the pages with wonderful little doodles that might yearn for a home in a children's book or a graphic novel, but what's the point (other than photographing them to become some sort of illustration influencer) ?

I'm not sure if the US version of "The Office" had an equivalent scene to the one where head office turns up, and it turns out the manager has spent all day inventing a new television game show. That's what comes to mind when I see some people's bullet journals.

I get it though. Doodling is kind of creative - and if we pooh pooh all creative things, you may as well destroy all books, popular music, and performing arts. Remember the movie "The Invention of Lying" ? Remember the performers reading history text books? That's what happens if you stop doodling. It probably has something to do with butterflies flapping their wings, and water dribbling across the back of Jeff Goldblum's hand.

I drank ONE glass of prosecco a few minutes ago, and this post is what happened. Can you imagine what would happen if I drank another glass? Probably not a good idea.

The greater part of this week has been spent submerged in an alien computer system - trying to make head or tail of how it works, how it hangs together, and how I might use it going forwards. There have been times when I wondered how far down the rabbit hole went - if I might see the surface again. This afternoon lightbulb after lightbulb switched on in the depths of my fragmented brain, and launched me back towards the surface. I suddenly have stories to tell co-workers, insights to share, and a brave new world to describe.

It's a relief.

It's amazing how much energy you expend when you don't know where you're going, or what you're really doing. Hitting google, textbooks, and discussion forums works to an extent, but the only real escape is via knowledge and experience - and they both have to be earned.

I'm shattered.

I'm finding it difficult to concentrate this afternoon. Having climbed to the top of the first mental hill of many I might face over the coming months, I'm wondering about downing tools for a while. It's difficult - I become my worst enemy at times like this. Now that I have reached the top of the first hill, I can see the next one. The temptation to set out towards it is enormous.

Perhaps I'll go and make a coffee.

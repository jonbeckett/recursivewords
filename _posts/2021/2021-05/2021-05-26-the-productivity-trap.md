For years I tinkered with all manner of productivity hacks - paper task lists, apps, websites, and so on - I even read some of the more famous books, such as "Getting Things Done", and "The 24 hour work week".

I spent years finding ways to fit more into each day.

It never occurred to me that I should have been looking for ways to do less - to achieve only what I needed to, leaving the remaining time free.

I think perhaps the lockdowns of the last year have brought into focus just how crazy the world we knew really was. We never stopped to consider that we might do less, because we never had time to - we were too busy running like mad to keep up with everybody else.

After a number of people chased me with prospective freelance webdesign projects in recent weeks, I thought it might be a good idea to have a homepage.

In reality, "jonbeckett.com" has existed for quite some time, but I have invariably redirected it to a profile page at about.com, which gives out a few links, and an email form.

At the moment it's very sparse, and the presentation of the portfolio is almost laughable - but it's a start. The essential information is there, and it can always be improved in the future.

I guess the fact that people have been asking for me when I didn't have a webpage online at allsays something.

Head over to http://jonbeckett.com and be nosey.

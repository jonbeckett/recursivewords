After giving it a couple of weeks, I've unplugged "the blog" (the one you're reading) from both Facebook and Google Plus. It's not a niche blog. It's not going to attract organic visitors in the same way that a company or magazine is going to... unless I turned my life into a bizarre Truman-show-esque creation similar to JustinTV or iJustine. We all know that's not going to happen.

While tinkering, and tidying up a little, I renamed the Tumblog to match - there is now a turningthepedals.tumblr.com too. I'm not about to post anything worthwhile there, because Tumblr sucks as a blogging platform - but I will post the more random stuff that doesn't seem right for Twitter, and is too short for the blog (so it's going to be mainly idiotic, candid, or nerdy photos). It's billed as the "abridged thoughts", and I guess that fits.

I also removed the About and Contact pages from the blog. I'm guessing nobody is going to really miss them. Half the fun of a personal blog is in discovering the real person through their views on things - their story, their experiences, and their opinions.

While writing, it's nearing 8pm on Sunday evening. The younger children are already in bed, and I've just given up on trying to watch Annie Hall on Netflix. It would appear our internet connection isn't good enough tonight to entertain the idea of streaming movies. Too bad, because I haven't seen Annie Hall before, and the few minuets I saw of it looked great.

I like Woody Allen. I haven't seen many of his movies, but the bits and pieces I have seen remind me of the voices inside my own head. The continual questioning, deliberating, and internal conflict. Those who have attempted to read me via a blog for any length of time can probably see some parallels. I guess I'm a fair amount more stable though - not having left a beautiful actress to run off with the nanny.

Anyway.

It's Sunday night. A few more hours of weekend before returning to the office. I need to buy one of those Initech mugs. I wonder if anybody else in the office would get the joke?

Where on earth did the evening go? Where on earth did the entire day go? I remember looking at my watch mid-morning, thinking it was going to be a slow day. That was obviously before the day began to have other ideas.

Lets just say the day was "trying". I think that just about covers it without breaking any confidences, or setting myself up to be marched into anybody's office.

In reality I'm just a bit down at the moment. I'm carrying a lot on my shoulders, and the strain is showing. No doubt as soon as the burden shifts, or is lessened, I will forget all about it once more.

Anyway.

This evening I made it into town to meet up with a friend of a friend to get their website design job kicked off. I'm going to be putting a website together for them, and doing some branding work. Finally something I know exactlyhow to do, and that I know I'm good at.

You never know - with a little luck I'll have something interesting to write about tomorrow night.

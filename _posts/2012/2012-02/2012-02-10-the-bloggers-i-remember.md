At lunchtime today I was flicking through Darren Rowse's "31 Days to Build a Better Blog" exercises, after passing the link on to a friend who is just starting out with their blog (it's a great series of exercises to get a blog off the ground, if you're wondering). While reading, I happened upon the "Make a List" exercise, and it got me thinking. Not enough thinking to doanything, but it sat there at the back of my brain all afternoon without my knowledge, forming plans.

While catching up with the various blogs I follow on Google Reader this evening, it occurred to me that I've been following some of the people for years. Since before we had children. Before many of the blogging platforms we take for granted even existed.

Enough with the preamble. Go follow the links, explore, read, enjoy... they are all great. The various descriptions are lifted from their blogs where available, in their own words.

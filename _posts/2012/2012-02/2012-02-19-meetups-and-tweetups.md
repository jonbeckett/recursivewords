Over the past couple of years I have dipped into and out of the community of bloggers writing at Tumblr, and vicariously witnessed the various meetups that the New York contingent in particular seem so prevalent in organising and attending. It's interesting because it doesn't seem to happen anywhere else.

Perhaps it's because I'm not looking hard enough (if at all). A cursory search of "meetups", "tweetups", or "tumblr meetups" in London turns up very little. It's almost disconcerting.

A voice is whispering into my brain that if nothing exists, I would be the perfect person to start something. A blogger of the old world. Somebody who has walked the online streets. The reality however is that expectation and responsibility govern most of my days - effectively counting me out of organising or attending anything for myself any more.

Perhaps that needs to change though. Perhaps I doneed to do something that is mine. Something that involves friends not made through work, or school. I might not be jumping on a transatlantic flight any time soon, but I may begin taking notice of bloggers closer to home... bloggers I might actually meet at some point.

I am now the proud owner of a Costa Coffee card. I just picked one up from the counter while ordering exactly the right thing, using exactly the right language. This might sound like a ridiculous thing to think about, but when you get some snot nosed barista looking down their nose at you when you ask for a "regular cappuccino" instead of a "medium cappuccino", it starts to pull away at the loose ends of your psyche.

Perhaps I really do have a hangup about "fitting in", or rather "going unnoticed".

The coffee shop is slowly filling with a variety of people from all walks of life. The corner area seems to have been hijacked by the local "yummy mummies". They keep breezing in with their perfect hair and perfect children, and air kissing each other. I bet their children have names like Rupert and Tabatha.

Two architects are discussing a drawing in the middle of the coffee shop - one of them is South African, and has glasses attached to a cord around his neck. The other is wearing a pinstripe shirt, and looks for all the world like Gene Kranz (he of Apollo mission control fame).

I'm not entirely sure how I'm going to spin this coffee out for another hour. I've only been here for 15 minutes and I'm already getting fidgety.

Oh look... another yummy mummy, breezing in from her Mercedes, executing a perfect "I didn't know you were here" wave, even though they probably arranged this get-together in a hail of Facebook messages.

Must. Find. Something. Constructive. To. Do.

Saturday began like any other day; with the eruption of the radio alarm clock, the flooding of cold sunlight across the bedroom, and the calls from little people for permission to go downstairs. I vaguely remember 7:30am, and remember thumping my head back into the pillows. I also remember snapping awake at 8:40 and seeing W hopping around with one leg in a pair of jeans.

"I'm going to feed the rabbits - somebody might arrive to look at the bathroom light switch"

"I better get up then"

Two minutes later I wobbled around in the downstairs bathroom, half asleep, being assaulted by jets of hard water from our dilapidated shower. While propped on the edge of the bed a few minutes later pulling socks on, I spied Miss Six doing the same thing across the landing.

"And where are you going ?"

"Feed rabbits", she replied in a defensive tone.

I smiled, and wandered down the stairs, pulling a t-shirt on as I went.

The rest of the day more or less happened to me. With no grand design, I somehow ended up re-painting a pottery money box, helping paint a wooden keep-sake box, walking into town to help spend pocket money, washing up, tidying up, helping build the biggest lego creation in the known universe, helping destroy said creation, washing up again, tidying up again... you get the idea.

While sat here writing this, the clock is ticking past 8pm, and I'm wondering what to do with the remains of the day. How best to spend it. Do I wander off into Azeroth for an hour of ultimately useless diversion? Wander off across the web in search of the interesting, original and weird? Or do I grab a good book...

Decisions, decisions.

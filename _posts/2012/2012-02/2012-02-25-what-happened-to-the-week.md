It seems like days since I last wrote in the blog. I guess it hasbeen days. When I'm buried in stress during the daytime, it pretty much kills off any thoughts about writing in the evenings - unless I'm staying in a hotel with work.

There was a moment this week while eating dinner with W and the children - I'm not really sure what we were talking about now - but "me not talking about work at home" cropped up, and I did touch on it for once.

"I work on things that are ridiculously difficult to think about sometimes. Really hard. I couldn't even begin to explain most of it to anybody else in the house because you wouldn't understand any of it, and that's why I don't talk about it. When you see me come home looking worn out, or fed up - that's why".

Other than work swallowing the greater part of my life, a couple of freelance jobs have appeared out of nowhere, prompting me to put my own website back in order. So what haveI been up to for the last several days ?

Installed Drupal on jonbeckett.com and back-populated a few blog posts. I still need to decide on a look and feel for it, and to push a lot more content back into it - but at least people can find out what I do, where I am, and how I go about doing it. Installed Debian Linux on the netbook, after getting increasingly annoyed with Ubuntu. Everything has worked very well so far, apart from WPA2 encryption on the wireless network at home, but I suspect that's our garbage wireless access point. Ate enough pizza to sink a ship on Friday night when friends came to visit for the evening. Also drank enough to make me feel awful this morning. Worked on freelance stuff all day today (Saturday). It's all good though, because it's paid work. I'm going to try and just leave the money in the bank until we actually needit for something. Didn't go running at all.

This evening we're off to a "Mexican Night" at the school. A local restaurant is providing all the food, and parents are arriving en-masse to help raise funds. Should be fun.

As long as I don't drink too much, I might even go for a run in the morning. I'm guessing I'm going to have to start all over again though; it's been a few weeks since I ran at all, and the local 5 mile race is approaching fast.

Oh, and if you're wondering about the photo, while walking past the upstairs landing this morning, I happened upon a little girl playing Star Wars on her DS who was so engrossed in the action that she had stopped walking, and was just stood there - frowning.

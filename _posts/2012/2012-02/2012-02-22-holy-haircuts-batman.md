I will neither confirm or deny that somebody stole most of my hair this morning.

She was about thirty something, wearing a black t-shirt and blackleggings, brandished scissors at me, and threatened to talk to me about the weather and holidays.

I withstood her inane drivel for a good ten minutes before escaping into the cold morning air and fighting the traffic on my mountain bike.

Lucky escape if you ask me.

W reliably informed me over dinner this evening that once again I look like a five year old, and that having short hair makes my head look huge. Our eldest daughter laughed out loud when she said it. I'm guessing it was return fire after I made the (I thought innocent) comment that the beef in the stir fry at dinner time was a bit chewy...

Note to self - never comment on anything ever again.

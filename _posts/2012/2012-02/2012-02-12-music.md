A slow Sunday morning is affording the opportunity to vanish down a musical rabbit hole this morning - in pursuit of new music to listen to. A new soundtrack to live by.

So far the list includes;

Birdy, "Birdy" Christina Perri, "Lovestrong" Lana Del Rey, "Born to Die" Kate Walsh, "The Real Thing"

I suspect many of these artists have appeared in the background of US TV series. They all sound strangely familiar, and yet not - because (apart from "Video Games" by Lana Del Rey), I can't recall hearing any of their names before.

Anyway - go find them on whichever music service you use, have a listen, sit back, drink a cup of tea (how tremendously English of me!),soak them up, and enjoy.

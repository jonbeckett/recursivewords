The snow began falling as I cycled home last night. Snowflakes are surprisingly painful when your angular momentums coincide at sufficient velocity (that probably makes no sense to a mathematician, but it sounds good).

Snowflakes in your eyes are particularly painful. While passing a parked car, threading myself through gaps in the traffic, and trying to use the force to avoid frozen puddles hidden under the snow, my right eye got hit. It felt somebody had grated an ice cube, and thrown the bits in my face. While squinting alarmingly, I continued on - and the other eye got hit.

Now grimacing like Jack Palance, I slowed almost to a halt on the bike, and forgot about the attempts at Jedi snow sight. The bike immediately hit ice under the snow, and began sliding sideways under me. I'm not entirely sure how I remained upright, but I did.

This morning (as evidenced by the photo), the world has been turned white again. The clouds overhead keep making half-hearted attempts to snow again, but I think we're seen the back of it now. Over the last few days I have been caught between the childish reaction of "YAY! IT'S SNOWING!", and the more grown up "OH CRAP, IT'S SNOWING!".

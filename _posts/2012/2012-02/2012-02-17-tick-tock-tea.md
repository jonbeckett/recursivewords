While out on a secret shopping trip in town to compile goodies for an even more secret parcel I'll be sending to a friend, I spied something. Something I haven't seen for some time, and that I used to like a lot.

Rooibos Tea - otherwise known as "Redbush".

The mighty (or should that be "mightily untrustworth") Wikipedia has the following to say about the mythical properties of Rooibos; Rooibos is becoming more popular in Western countries, particularly among health-conscious consumers, due to its high level of antioxidants such as aspalathin and nothofagin, its lack of caffeine, and its low tannin levels compared to fully oxidized black tea or unoxidized green tea leaves. So there you go. I've been growing increasingly tired of normal tea and coffee for a while, so perhaps this will provide a respite - give my body half a chance to cleanse itself.

Not a lot of people know that I once spent two years trudging to and from college - and while studying computer science, and mathematics, I also studied photography, and art.

Close to twenty years on, the remnants are littered around our house - pottery adorns dark corners of the book cases, and old sketchbooks hide betweenencyclopediasand dictionaries.

I haven't drawing anybody or anything properly for at least a decade.

You will therefore share in my moment of raised eyebrows when an email arrived late last night from a far flung friend enquiring about the possibility of me raising a pencil in anger once more for a secret project.

Obviously I can't divulge anythingabout the project, but the romantic part of me is screaming "HELL YES!" from imaginary rooftops, while doing cartwheels.

I guess the problem now is proving to myself if I really can still draw or not. Doodling in a Moleskine notebook is one thing - drawing somebody or something for a particular purpose is an entirely different matter. Perhaps I just need to start doodling with intent.

p.s. the drawing is of a girl I knew once upon a time. There is a very slight chance she could see the drawing, so I'm not going to say too much about it - it will be a nice surprise.

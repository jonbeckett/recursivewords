Over the course of the last few hours I have been searching out old haunts on the internet - in pursuit of original, interesting, and well written personal blogs. I'm coming up with very little, and while it would be easy to become disillusioned, quite the reverse seems to have occurred - the search is becoming more determined.

I suspect my failure to find anybody is a failure of discovery - not a lack of their existence. It also points towards a change in the nature of our relationship with the internet as a whole - a change I mentioned a few days ago while debating my departure from Tumblr - that people were becoming more insular; existing within the bounds of the various social networks they participate in, and rarely venturing outside.

The unfortunate side effect of the retreat of the masses to social networks is the vast majority of content picked up by search engines is the garbage designed to game them, rather than the carefully composed thoughts, ideas and opinions recorded by people such as myself.

While this blog is seemingly surrounded on all sides by machine generated flotsam, it hopefully stands true as a beacon of "how things once were". Real thoughts, ideas and opinions pitched into the internet firehose for the interest, enjoyment and amusement of the countless unknown who happen upon them.

If you stumbled upon this island in the stream, thank you for taking the time to read. With a little luck you will hit the follow button, subscribe, take a look at the blogroll, explore further, and we'll begin reminding the world about the importance of each other, and the connections we forge.

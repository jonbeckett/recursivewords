Once upon a time I would sit down each night and pour the contents of my head into the keyboardtelling tales, relating stories, and finding words to describe the happening of the day. It would appear those days are either coming to an end, or in a state of continued cessation.

Take this morning for instanceI sat down to write this post half an hour ago. I've had to deal with three fights between the children, and have ended up turning the music up unreasonably loud to drown out their arguing. Hellthis is the first time I have sat down at the computer to write anything in days.

Screaming, crying, and hysterical protests of "not fair" are floating down the stairs. It's all being projected loudly enough to make sure the entire house hears. I'm trying to take no notice.

Apart from the daily child wrangling struggles, I've also found myself being drawn into freelance web design work recentlywhich would normally be fine if my day job hadn't become a bit of a nightmare. The old phrase "it never rains but it pours" has never seemed so apt.

Conversation that just happened (after Miss Eight appeared in the door, snotty faced after hysterical crying, resplendant in pyjamas at 11am)"Can I have the computer?" (she means the laptop)"How about you go and get dressed, wash your face, brush your teeth, and brush your hair first?"She then grabbed the door of the study and slammed itbefore marching into the lounge and shouting "DAD SAYS WE HAVE TO GET DRESSED, WASH OUR FACES, AND BRUSH OUR HAIR!"I walked in behind her."And brush your teeth""SEE!" (screamed tearfully) and she stamped off towards the stairs.

Oh, today is going to be fun.

I can't believe it's been the best part of a week since I last wrote in the blog. There was a time when I wrote every dayrecorded everything that happened. Let's just say that recent times have been "difficult".

Work has been hard. The stresses of jumping into other people's shoes, and fighting their battles are hard. For the last couple of weeks I've returned home from work with no further aspirations than getting the washing up done, spending an hour with the children, and watching television. Before this week, I can't remember the last time I sat and watch television on an eveningwe're talking at least five years ago.

It doesn't help that I've not been well at all for the last few days. Aches and pains mostly, but enough of them to make me miserable. Of course I've not complained, and I've carried on, but my spirits have been incredibly low.

Here's hoping the week ahead is somehow easierit certainly should be; tomorrow marks the 60th year of Queen Elizabeth II's reignthe "Diamond Jubilee". We have bunting up outside the house, and all manner of food prepared for a picnic on the green tomorrow with friends and neighbours. Here's hoping the weather is kind to us.

Nearly forgot. While wandering back from the corner shop earlier I discovered the traveller guy running his horse and trap around the green outside our house, and finally did what no other neighbours have dared; I stopped him, and told him what he is doing is illegal.

Apparently my telling him that the green is not common land, making his running his horse on it completely illegal didn't go down well at all. He confronted me repeatedly as I wandered back to our house, and wanted to know names of people objecting to him.

If I get beaten up by a group of travellers, at least we'll know who and whynot that the police will be able to do anything about them at all.

I had the strangest dream last night. I was walking through London, and spotted a girl I grew up across the road from on the other side of the roadstanding by a photographer.

Before I knew it, I was wearing a long military jacket with medals on, and aviator sunglasses, with our arms around each other posing for photos. It started out with her stood next to me, but I clearly thought that looked stupid and told her sopulling her close, and wrapping arms around each other's backs. The photographer had a full length mirror in front of her, and was peeking out from behind it snapping shots.

After we finished, we stood on the other side of the mirror, and there was a huge colour printing machine (in the street) with a touch screen to pick your photos. While looking, we started seeing the photos pop up of the next girl the photographer was taking who stripped naked and put a thong on!?Unfortunately I then woke up. Why does that always happen ?Somehow in the next five minutes I had another weird dreamsomething about an airport being built, and my brother being in the departure lounge, and some guy asking if he could have the magazine I was reading when I finished it. None of it made any cohesive sense what-so-ever

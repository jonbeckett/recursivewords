I'm sat here at work on Monday morning, and I'm pretty much burned out before the week has even begun. I'm thinking that perhaps spending twenty minutes emptying my head into the computer will help me focus for the rest of the day on programming. Perhaps.

The weekend was good.

On Saturday morning I worked on a freelance web project for most of the morning. one of the kids came in from the playpark looking for something to eat, and I was about to tell her "wait until lunchtime" when I looked at my watch, and realised it waslunchtime.

On Saturday evening W's brother arrived, and I volunteered to stay home and look after the kids while she went for a drink. I had promised the kids a movie night at some point over the weekend, so wandered into town with our eldest to get suppliespizza, drinks, and snacks. On our way home we met a friend who lives nearbyon her way out to meet friends for the evening too. You know those moments when you see somebody you know, and they look fantastic, and you don't know if it would be ok to say as much? That. By the time I realised I should have said something it was too late.

The kids watched "Superman" in the endthe version with Christopher Reeve. It seemed to go down well, but caused the mother of all tantrums from our 8 year old when I announced it was bedtime. Not for the first time, I found myself carrying a thrashing, screaming child up the stairs. Everything had been so peaceful until that point it was like she pressed some kind of "instant DEFCON 1" button or something.

Sunday began with the staging of a pentathlon outside on the green for Miss 8 (the very same "Miss Tantrum Pants") for her school project on the Olympics. With borrowed hurdles from school, a high jump made from garden canes, and numerous running races, we had all kinds of fun. The friend I crossed paths with previously came out with her children too, and Sunday just turned into the best "blow off" day in ages.

It ended being invited to their place for baked potatoes yesterday eveningwhich turned into sitting in their garden for several hours swapping stories, drinking, and laughing. Good times. We seriously need to pay the favour backI'm thinking a barbecue one weekend soon. Or perhaps resurrect the pizza and movie night thing we used to do (where we pick a rubbish movie, and talk all the way through it).

Anywayso here we areMonday morning. Our eldest left for a residential trip with school this morningshe's staying (with several hundred other kids) at some place on Dartmoor for the week. I gave her my camera last night to take with her. I wonder if I'll ever see it again?

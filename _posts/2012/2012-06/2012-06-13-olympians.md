Our 8 year old is doing a school project on the Olympics, part of which is to prepare a "project board" at homea presentation board covering any aspect of the Olympics she likes.

Seeing as Google is her favourite webpage in the world, she sat one evening typing in famous British Olympians names, and finding out if she could try and get in contact with them to ask questionsthe kind of questions an 8 year old would be interested in; Why did you choose the sport you did ? Did you eat anything special ? Where did you practice ? What was your favourite thing about the Olympics ?Almost unbelievably, they are all writing back. The project board is going to look like we did itnot her. This evening, signed photos and a wonderful handwritten letter from Mary Peters (gold medal heptathlete at the Munich games). Liz McColgan's letter arrived yesterdayWe're wondering who will arrive tomorrow!

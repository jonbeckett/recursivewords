Has it really been a week since I last wrote in the blog? Apparently so. I'm sat in the study at home, late in the evening on a Friday night, wondering what happened "of note" this week that I might record for posterity.

Work was busy, but productive again. I'm still working on a huge project, but have broken the back of the most significant part of it's development. Next week will be interesting, because I will need to integrate the work done so far with other developers. Quite how I will now trust anybody else to take the care I have with the code is anybody's guess.

At home the week has been uneventful. The routine of washing up and tidying up feels ever more like a hamster wheel with no exitwhich isn't particularly helpful when you're trying to earn extra money doing freelance web development work in the evenings. It didn't help that two evenings this week I was left home alone with the girls from the moment I walked in the doormeaning I had to do dinner and the bedtime single handed, and got nothing done at all.

The last few weeks have seemed very much like a treadmillaccompanied by tiredness, irritability, and short tempers. The kids have been ratty every evening at bedtimeno doubt because we're too busy to give them the attention they should be getting.

This evening I tried to redress the balance a little, and set about sorting out our eldest's netbook computer, that hasn't been working properly for weeks. After updating Windows, Chrome, and installing Google Drive, I'm hoping that we can get her using Google Mail, and Google Calendar. She's asking about Facebook and Twitter but we're holding the lineshe's only 11 years old, and the EULA for Facebook stipulates 13 or older. I was surprised to discover Twitter has no age restriction. In some ways I wish all the social networks would set a common precedent, and set the bar fairly high.

Anyway tomorrow (if the opportunity presents itself), I'm going to have the fun of showing an 11 year old girl Google Mail, Google Calendar, and Google Drive. I wonder how quickly she will become bored of it all ?

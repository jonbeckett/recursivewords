I'm starting to wonder if I've been cheating old father time for the last few years, and he's just discovered the discrepency while doing an audit.

Back when I broke my shoulder in my mid twenties, I discovered two thirds of the way through the course of pain killers that I was allergic to penicillin. It has affected me ever since - probably for the rest of my life. Although the effects come and go, if I lightly scratch my skin on a bad day, angry red wields will appear a few moments later. It happened this morning while having a coffee and talking to colleagues.

Yesterday - through some freakish ability to injure myself that only I seem to know about - I got up from my desk at work, and a sudden pain went through my shoulder blades like I had been shot. You know when you sleep in an odd position, or leave a window open, and wake up the next day with a stiff neck? Like that - but worse.

I spent most of yesterday afternoon on pain killers, and then got home to discover I was cooking my own and our eldest's dinner, washing up, and tidying up while everybody else went to Brownies (our youngest's first visit to Brownies!). In a pretty stupid move after dinner, I sat with our eldest watching television, and drank half a bottle of wine. I haven't drunk anything alcoholic in a week, and it went straight to my head.

I was in bed by 10:30, propped up at an angle that didn't cause my neck to hurt, and watched the pilot of "Community" downloaded from iTunes on the iPad (need to watch a few more to decide if I like it or not).

I can't remember falling asleep.

p.s. my neck still hurts, but not as bad.

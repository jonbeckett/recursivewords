We took part in a fundraiser at the infant school this evening - raising money for two daughters of a friend to go on a trip to Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. After performing abjectly at a recent similar event, we redressed the balance tonight. It was pretty embarrassing actually - we didn't just win by a bit...

One of the rounds was naming photos of half chocolate bars - the women on the table obsessed over it, and got 24 out of 25 right. My contribution to the evening appeared to be knowing that the St Valentines Day Massacre related movie with a ukelali playing "Sugar" was "Some Like it Hot". I also knew that Mick the Miller was the most successful greyhound ever, that the Whale Shark is the biggest known fish, and that Lake Victoria is the biggest in Africa.

Oh - and I also knew that Selenium's periodic table symbol is Se. I have no idea what my sparse knowledge about the world we live in says about me

I am my own worst enemy. Not content with having a self-hosted wordpress blog that I haven't written anything in for over a week, I have been nosing around LiveJournal again for the last hour.

There is a reason though - one of my favourite bloggers, and a long time friend on the internet has a LiveJournal blog. She was sort of famous back in the day in her own country for her blog, and writes wonderfully when time allows. Connecting with her on LiveJournal seems like meeting her on her own ground somehow.

I remember watching The Social Network in the cinema, and seeing Zuckerberg using LiveJournal. I remember wandering out of the cinema and wondering out loud if LiveJournal would see a spike in traffic in response to Zuck having used it way back when.

Anyway. I have a LiveJournal blog. I'm not going to post the name of it here because I want to keep it entirely separate - hopefully you all understand that. It's another escape (how many escapes do I need?).

I need coffee. I may be some time...

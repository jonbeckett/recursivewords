Leaving the house on Thursday afternoon wasn't so much a planned departure, as a concerted effort to lever everybody from the house. A somewhat calm day rapidly descended into shouting, fighting, tantrums, crying, and retribution - and that was just the grow ups.

Apart from the clothes and wash bags, we've come away with far less than ever before this time - relying on the combined talents of Apple and Nintendo to entertain the kids over the next few days. The sight of six or seven handheld devices charging the night before we either entertaining, or a vision of hell, depending on your point of view.

We finally left mid afternoon, and began the 5 hour slog to the coast. Despite hitting traffic and various accidents along the way, the kids were unexpectedly great on the way - although that may have had a lot to do with the acquisition of Smurf and Moshi Monster top trumps earlier in the day.

We crossed the Tamar bridge as darkness began to fall, and finally arrived at my parents at 8:30pm. There's something wonderful about seeing your children run up the drive of their grandparents house - especially when they only get to see them two or three times each year.

Our stay so far has unfolded as it should - no plans, no hurry, and no expectations. I think today will involve a visit to the mythical Trago Mills (perhaps the biggest, most disorganised, yet best value shop that sells almost everything you might ever think of, and lots of things you never thought of).

I'll try to write more in the coming days...

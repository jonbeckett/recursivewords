Yes, yes, I know "the day didn't stop" is a ridiculous statement. Of course days don't stopthat would imply either the earth stopping spinning (whereupon momentum would cause everything to fall over), or some kind of Emmet Brown style time jiggery pokery.

Really thoughtoday didn't stop.

Just for a change, I'm actually going to talk about what I did at work. I think I can do so without getting into too much trouble. Cycled to work through torrential rain, with a change of clothes in my bag. Made coffee for my co-workers several times. Wrote PHP scripting to output information from an online database into XML Sucked the XML back into a workflow running on a SharePoint server, that created records in the intranet for the sales guys to mangle as they see fit. Worked on change requests for somebody else's project for the majority of the day, and seemed to finish each task in a quarter of the estimated time. Either I'm brilliant, or the estimates were bullshit. I'm guessing the latter. Cycled home through huge puddles while listening to the BBC News Quiz podcast, and laughing out loud. Worked on a freelance web design project for the majority of the evening. Can't tell you anything about it yetall top secret. Washed up, and tidied the kitchen up.Now if you'll excuse me, I have some internet surfing to completewhile sat in bed with my phone, the netbook, and the iPad.

In other news, the alarm just went off on my wristwatch. I caught the buttons on it while pulling a t-shirt over my head the other day, and something went beep. The irony that I can program a PC in numerous programming languages, but cannot figure out how the hell to switch the alarm off on a cheap wristwatch is not lost on me.

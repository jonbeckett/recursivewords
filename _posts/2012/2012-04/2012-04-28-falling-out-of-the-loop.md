I never thought I would say this, but I've kind of fallen off the blogging horse. I know it will be temporary, transitory, or any of those other long words people use to navel gaze over their own behaviour, but I don't mind admitting that it feels tremendously unfamiliar.

I've recorded so much, and for so long, that not feeling the urge to do so is kind of conspicuous. Of course it also means I might have something to say when I return, rather than so much self analysis, or drifting swathes of directionless garbage.

This whole "not blogging" view-point is of course a protective construct - to shield myself from writing about the various frustrations I face at the moment, commonly known as "life happening". I guess I just object to life involving quite so much washing up, tidying up (behind children AND adults), child wrangling, and argument avoidance.

Some days feel like a tightrope walk.

You are my safety net. My escape. For quite some time now, when tired, weary, or down, I head to the internet and read your stories, look at your pictures, and remind myself that the world isn't quite as bad as it might appear. Now and again one or two of you make my phone vibrate, and I smile. My spirits are lifted in the simple knowledge that somebody took a few seconds to reach out.

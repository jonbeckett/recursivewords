In a spectacular display of ass-hattery, the hosting company of one of the services we use all the time at work decided it would be a good idea to upgrade the server without warning us.

End result: I lose most of my afternoon hacking a webserver, making changes to Ruby programming (one of the few languages I don't know) in order to make it work. In real-world terms, I was sticking the engine of the car back together with sticky tape and bubblegum - only in this case, if one of the bits of bubble gum was in the wrong place, the whole car bursts into flames.

I got everything working again, but also said goodbye to most of my afternoon. I might buy something to drink on the way home. I need it. And before you start thinking "wino", it's over a week since I last drank any alcohol.

It's been one of those days - up early, single handed the entire day, take all the kids to football (eldest plays for the town - they got thrashed), drag the kids around the supermarket food shopping, buy a world of crap to eat, home, cook, eat, tidy up, wash clothes, wash dishes, wrangle children, make dinner, washup, and finally other half arrives home.

I was supposed to get on with freelance web design work today. It didn't happen. It won't happen tonight either because we're going out to a charity fund raiser. It won't happen tomorrow either because W's invited friends for lunch (meaning the entire morning will be a mad tidy-up that if I don't help with, will cause a huge argument).

My worry is that the "one of those days" days are becoming every day.

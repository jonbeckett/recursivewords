After much dicking around (something I seem to be particularly talented at), I renamed my LiveJournal account to my real name. I don't like "hiding" online - as anybody will know that's seen me change my Tumblr account in the past. I always revert to being "me".

So - my LiveJournal username is "jonbeckett". Go visit, and gasp in wonder at the LiveJournal dinosaur. I'm not joking - it's an ancient relic of the early web. I'll admit to being quietly amused that LiveJournal has outlived it's successor (Vox).

Vox was a shame. In many ways it was ahead of it's time - it bore many similarities to Tumblr, and was far superior. It had proper commenting, proper privacy controls, and easy sharing of media... I remember being invited into the early beta programme by a web designer friend in San Francisco, and being enthused with this new social network thing that had been created.

Anyway... I should get on with some work I suppose.

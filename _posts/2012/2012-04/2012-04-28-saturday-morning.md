For the first time in weeks we have nothing planned today. Saying that, it's tipping down with rain outside. The kids have avoided killing each other so far, but there is still time.

I'm picking away at a web development project - although kind of hamstrung because the designer has been away for the last few weeks. I've done as much as I sensibly can without direct input, but in reality it's not that much.

(insert two hours while I fight a running battle with the children)

I knew it was too good to be true - our eldest just had the mother of all tantrums about being told to tidy her bedroom up, middle girl child had a melt-down about losing a new drink bottle, and questionably better half exploded at me for fighting with the kids.

As per usual it's all my fault, regardless of whatever is going on. I need to get a t-shirt with "I don't know what I've done yet, but sorry anyway" written on it.

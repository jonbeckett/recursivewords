If you've been wondering about my relative silence online, it's because three things happened; I lost it with Windows 8 and formatted the machine at home Google gave me "Google Drive" last nighttheir cloud storage service Quite by chance, I discovered you can upload unlimited amounts of photos to Google Photos as long as you keep them under 20482048 pixels.I have therefore been busy tinkering. In the spirit of tinkering, of course, I have ended up going more sideways than forwards. Installed Ubuntu 11.10 on the home desktop machine Connected to my home computer via SSH from work Installed NoMachine both at home and at work to access the desktop remotely (a bit like Terminal Services). Created a virtual machine running under VirtualBox with Windows 7 inside itand installed Picasa to help bulk-load the photos up to Google.A few moments ago W called me sounding pretty iratethe Guide Leaders have sent her another PDF form to fill out, and it will only load in the latest version of Adobe Acrobat. She sounded like she's ready to punch somebody her Mac won't load it, and Linux won't load it either. Thankfully we have a Dell laptop for the kids, otherwise I would have had Dick Dastardly style shouting down the phone probably.

Ohalmost forgotmy old Yahoo account was hacked last night too, and the entire address book sent spam links. Yay for me.

My quite wonderful far flung friendAntidamenfrom Norway (we have known each other sincewaybefore Tumblr), requested answers to the following questions - who am I to turn down an invitation from a beautiful girl from the north ? 

Do you believe you have experienced "true love"?

That's a really subjective question. I always tend to think people who claim "true love" have not lived enough, so following that thought through, no - because I don't think it exists. It's a wonderfully romantic notion, but it's also kind of crazy. We are all individuals at the end of the day - and in relationships by choice. Nothing says we were "supposed" to be together.

Are you satisfied with your current job/school situation?

For the moment, yes. I have always been a bit of a dreamer, so often entertain thoughts of doing something else. While stood in the shower this morning for example, I started thinking through the possibility of building a better Tumblr...

Tell me about the funniest thing that has ever happened to you?

I'm going to take "funny" as "unexpected". While searching the internet randomly for the place my parents live one night several years ago, I happened upon somebody who had blogged on MySpace about their bike ride to the beach below my parents house. I commented. We (eventually) became the best real world friends of each other as a result. We only see each other in person perhaps once a year (sometimes less), but think the world of each other, and in a strange way value the disconnection - it provides our escape from our every-day life.

Tell me about that coincidence that couldn't have been just a coincidence?

I don't believe in fate, but if I have to attribute any chance happening to the universe moving in mysterious ways, then the above is perhaps the one.

Name some of the DVDs or books that have made you cry (or almost cry)?

Forrest Gump, Mr Holland's Opus, What Dreams May Come

If you could go back in time today and talk to yourself when you were .. like.. 10 years old or something, what would you tell yourself?

One day you're going to beat your Dad at chess without really trying in front of your children, and you're going to feel bad about it afterwards. Winning easily is hard sometimes.

Why are we here?

We are here because a bunch of amino acids formed just the right mixture at just the right stage of the development of the ball of mud we call "Earth" a few billion years ago.

A kickass song you like listening to when you're angry?

I never really get angry - frustrated maybe, but not angry. I can't remember ever listening to music while angry. I have listened to music while sad, lost, or lonely (I guess most people have though, right?). Tracks like "No One is to Blame" by Howard Jones, or "Gravity Happens" by Kate Voegele.

What's the nicest compliment anyone has ever given you?

Somebody once sent me an anonymous message that they had a huge crush on me. Nobody had ever had a crush on me before (to my knowledge). I was (and still am) floored by even the thought of it.

How are you feeling today?

I'm tired. Of everything. We just got back from a few days away. Tomorrow is my last day off work - I'm not looking forward to returning, and I'm not looking forward to the world of expectation and routine waiting for me when I wake up tomorrow.

Any plans for a summer holiday?

No - although I think others will probably dictate that to me, and I'll have to go along with it without arguing to avoid conflict, wether I want to or not. I do that a lot.

Another day passes, and once again it feels like my feet have hardly touched the ground all day. From the moment the radio alarm clock burst into life at 7am, through adventures in breakfast and lunch making, through the work day, taking my life in my hands through traffic there and back, and finally through dinner and washing up, it just hasn't stopped.

Busy is good sometimes, though, isn't it? At least it means the day doesn't drag. I just wish the middle "busy" part of the day didn't involve being drafted in to pull other people's work out of the fire quite so often. It sometimes feels like you're a mechanic receiving somebody's car that has been run over by a tank, with the hopeful owner innocently asking "can you fix it?"

Earlier in the week I mentioned to the marketing guy "If I never let on to anybody that I'm any good at anything, they'll never ask me to help them with anything".

I'm listening to Christina Perri on Grooveshark - chiefly because I don't want to configure the music player in Ubuntu until I've upgraded to the latest version (12.04 LTS got released today). I saw that they've switched back from Banshee to Rhythmbox, and I would rather not waste the time letting it scan the MP3 mountain, only to have to re-do it later.

Oh crap... this blog post is sliding off into geek-ville, isn't it. The tech stuff seems to have swept over me like the sea coming in recently. I need to remember to do something else from time to time... you know... watch television, or something. I somehow broke the "TV habit" back when I was commuting into London every day, and never really went back to it. The only show I regularly watch now is "Big Bang Theory" - although I did download a few episodes of "Community" on advice from the girl that sits behind me at work, and will admit to liking it quite a bit.

For now though, I will content myself with becoming frustrated with the Ubuntu servers, which are being deluged with an army of geeks. I want the new version, dammit.

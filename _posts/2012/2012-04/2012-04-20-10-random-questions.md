While noodling around this lunchtime on the interwebs, it struck me that I haven't done one of these exercises in quite some time. After googling the random questions, you now know how I spent the remains of my lunchbreak...

What was the last thing you had to drink?

A cup of tea, made by the wonderful girl that sits behind me at work. It's perhaps worth pointing out that anybody who makes me a cup of tea is wonderful - it's not just because she's young, and very pretty. Honest.

What are you wearing right now?

Old running shoes, jeans, black fleece top, blue t-shirt under it.

Do you wash your car or let the car wash do it?

I don't have a car. I ride a mountain bike to work, come rain or shine. The mountain bike explains why I have trouble pulling particular makes of jeans over my legs.

Last food that you ate?

I bought lunch from the van today, after we ran out of bread at home (or rather, I made the children's packed lunches first, knowing we were low on bread). I got a cheese and pickle sandwich (crusty white bread), some kind of flapjack type thing, and a bar of chocolate.

Where were you last week at this time?

I was sat here, at this desk, typing on this keyboard, stressing over the same stuff, and using the same websites to aid my efforts in procrastination.

Have you bought any clothing items in the last week?

Hell no. My need for new clothes ranks just about last, behind absolutely everything else in our house. That's not to say I don't have clothes - because I do - but I'm not really one for going clothes shopping on purpose. The last clothes I recieved were for Christmas from my other half.

When is the last time you ran?

A couple of months ago I went for a 5K run around town, and surprised myself. I really should go running far more often, because I enjoy it. Other things always seem to get in the way (you know, like sitting on my ass reading junk on the internet all evening, or tinkering with some freelance webdesign project or other).

What's the last sporting event you watched?

The Formula One race in China last weekend. I'm not entirely sure that qualifies as sport though - more of an elitist club of gigantic car manufacturers. If I'm ever flipping through the channels and happen upon field athletics I will watch it. I will quite openly admit that I think Yelena Isinbayeva is the best thing since sliced bread.

What is your favorite animal?

Let's come out of left field with this - how about Raccoons ? They have opposable thumbs, and can therefore undo the knots in garbage bags, turn door handles, and all manner of things that many other animals can't do. Of course - anybody who lives near forests where they are prevalent hates them for exactly the same reasons.

Your dream vacation?

An air/rail/road trip to all of the people I have come to know well on the internet. Immediate destination would be Norway, and then on to the United States - visiting New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, and various other places along the way.

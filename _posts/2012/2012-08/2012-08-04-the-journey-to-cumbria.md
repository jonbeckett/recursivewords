We finally left the house at about 10:30, and set out for "The Lake District" once more. After six uneventful hours, we finally arrived in Boot, just down the road from Eskdale, with a fantastic chalet to explore. W's parents and brother had arrived a little while before, and wandered round to say hello.

After not booking anywhere to eat, we ended up not getting in anywhere nearby, and returned to the chalet to make something for ourselves while everybody else returned to the pub. In some ways I was happy about it; we cannot afford to eat out every night, and the cards falling this way saved us a huge chunk of money.

I spent the greater part of the evening running around the grounds of the chalets with our youngest, exploring the river, the woods, and the lawns while chasing each other and laughing.

Staying in also meant we were able to sit and watch the Olympics this evening - to see Jessica Ennis and Mo Farah win gold. Proud, proud moments, where we stopped everything, and got the kids to watch, and to remember moments in history.

Tomorrow is another day, and we set out for a walk in the hills. Here's hoping the sun shines.

While dissolving into a puddle of sweat in the office yesterday (computers don't make for good refrigeration devices), I texted my better half;

"If you pick up some stuff, we could have a barbecue later"

Immediate response;

"Funny... the kids just said the same thing"

And so it was that I arrived home after a slog across town in the humid heat haze of the evening sun, to an already lit barbecue, glowing orange in anticipation of sausages and chicken.

What I didn't anticipate was the arrival of extra little people, in the shape of our children's friends who live nearby, and the absence of bread. Apparently the same person that imagined a barbecue involves salad, boiled potatoes, and chopped vegetables (my other half), also didn't think it might be an idea to buy bread to wrap around the various meat she bought (she's vegetarian). She also didn't get herself anything. Somehow this was all my fault.

After completing my cooking duties (why DO men have to do the cooking on a barbecue?), we sat down outside, drank wine, and did not very much at all for the remainder of the evening.

Highlight of the late evening; the discovery of a new TV show (well... new to us) called "Suburgatory". I've never seen a US show make such cutting (and often hilarious) observations on suburban America. Yes, I know it's only a TV show, but I know people like the characters in the show.

Ok, so the title was a bit on the dramatic side. I'm back at work after a day off - wrestling with source code once again, and peering up the side of mount improbable which seems to be defended by legions of infidels throwing unrealistic expectations down at me. I've either caught or dodged their hurled missiles so far, but it's only a matter of time until I lose my footing, and begin a rapid, flailing slide towards disaster.

I'm rather enjoying having a "proper" blog again. The somewhat secret community at Tumblr is good, but the platform encourages shallow feedback; which then encourages shallow contributions - a heavily filtered mugshot, a vacuous meme, a macro shot of your sandwich... it becomes difficult to really get to "know" many people properly. I think perhaps the abiding thing I take away from my time submerged in the tumblrsphere is that people will find each other no matter what obstacles are put in their way. I met some incredible people there, and will continue to return because of them.

In order to make time to write, to share, and to contribute once again, I've been offloading freelance web development work to third parties. In some ways it's sad because I've already built the relationship with the client, but in other ways it's only right - I already have a full time job, and the last thing my employer wants is me turning up burned out from yet another night coding. Sure, I'm probably the best web developer in the company as a result, but at what cost to both myself, and my family ?

I "re-discovered" twitter yesterday. Who knew that contributing anything would lead to follows and replies ? I'm being flippant of course. I've been a member of Twitter since they started back in20072006, and have had over a thousand people "follow" me since the early days. I suspect very few of them are active users, but I guess it still provides some form of bragging rights should I ever go for a social media job... you know, like the idiots that friend you on social networks and proclaim themselves as "Social Media Strategists", and such like.

Lunchtime is coming to an end. I should be raising my sword and shield to do battle once more. Wish me luck.

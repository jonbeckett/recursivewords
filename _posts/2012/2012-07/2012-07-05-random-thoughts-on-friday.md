The clock just ticked past midnight. It's now Friday in England. In a few short hours I will be rolling out of bed, rubbing sleep from my eyes and stumbling into the shower. I'll be dragging clothes on, washing up other people's breakfast things instead of eating my own, and turning the pedals of my bike towards work once again.

The last week has felt like a conveyor belt.

For the last half an hour I've sat in the lounge with the netbook, flicking through music channels on satellite television, wondering what happened to the MTV Europe of my youth - where are Ray Cokes, and Marianne van der Vlugt now ? I finally remembered the XBox can stream LastFM, and am listening to a hand picked radio station of singer songwriters while typing this garbage.

After waving my geek wand at it earlier today, the Netbook now dual-boots into Windows 7 or Linux. I can't help feeling that Linux is a better operating system for getting things done. I'm not sure why. It's clean, minimalist, and utilitarian. I'm using the "Focus Writer" word processor.

While helping W sort out photos for the school earlier, a fly was buzzing around the room - causing her to flail like a pink t-shirted King Kong. I retrieved a secret can of fly-spray from the book shelf, and fired a leading salvo across it's attack run. It suffered engine failure and bought the farm.

It's half past midnight. I should really think about climbing the wooden hill.

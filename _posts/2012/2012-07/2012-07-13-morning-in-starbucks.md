Well this is a novel experience... it's heading towards 10am, and I'm sat at a small table near the window in Starbucks, watching people come and go. After dropping the children at school, I wandered part of the way into town with a wonderful friend who lives opposite, and said wistful goodbyes as she wished she could come with me.

I can't remember ever having a "day off" like this before. Just taking a day for myself... a day of nothing.

In times past when I have sat in coffee shops ahead of meetings with work, there has always been a steady stream of "yummy mummies". It would appear that stream has begun; no doubt they have either dropped older children at school, or have just finished doing their makeup and hair before a busy day spending their trophy husband's money.

I'm guessing the showpiece children have names like Rupert, Tabatha, and Aurelia.

There is a guy sat directly in front of me, facing me. He's mid 50s, slim, and dressed like he just got off a yacht. The fact that the sea is at least 100 miles away isn't lost on me. He has a tall umbrella, and seems obsessed with his mobile phone. In between taking sips from his coffee, he adjusts his horn rimmed glasses, frowns, rubs his chin, and gazes intermittently past me.

A girl just wandered in to join the back of the queue. She's pretty, and is dressed more or less the same as me; jeans, cloth messenger bag, and hard wearing smock type coverall. She seems to have had the wisdom to wear a waterproof; I didn't and got rained on en-route.

The guy sat on the couch behind me just left, and an old woman immediately dropped everything and raced for the seat. The behaviour of the older generation brings endless amusement. Their opportunism, and outrageous sense of entitlement never ceases to amaze me. She's now complaining about the mug left on the table by the previous customer.

The girl who walked in a moment ago has just taken a table facing me. Holy crap she's pretty. I wonder why she's here on her own? I wonder if everybody here is either escaping from something, or just looking for a way to burn some of their empty day?

I don't do "nothing" well. I could have sat here daydreaming - instead I'm recording this drivel that few will read.

Oh look... Starbucks mugs for sale. I don't quite get that. Surely the idea of the coffee shop is that of a destination - an escape. Why would you want to take the mug home with you and drink coffee you made, and will have to wash up out of a mug with their logo on it?

I suppose half the reason I rarely set foot in coffee shops is because I know we have a perfectly good supply of coffee, milk, sugar and hot water at home - and can probably make a tray full of coffees for the same price as a single cup from Starbucks or Costa. Home would also be silent - and while devoid of the sound of yummy mummies perfect babies complaining their babyccino is out of reach, it would also be devoid of life - of inspiration - of the world wandering by.

The 50s guy is still frowning at his phone. It's a candy bar phone, so I can't imagine what might be so interesting on it? Perhaps he's text messaging his girl or boyfriend? Playing sudoku? And he's finally up - leaving. So is the pretty girl. Perhaps this was a secret meeting - sat two tables apart.

I wonder if the staff in coffee shops invent fictional life stories for their customers? Quiet days must be hell.

What the hell is a "frappuccino?"

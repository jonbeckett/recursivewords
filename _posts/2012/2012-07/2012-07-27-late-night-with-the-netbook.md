It's heading towards 1am, and I'm sitting in the dark with the netbook. I'm camping out in the lounge tonight - the patio doors are wide open, with occasional moths, bugs, and night visitors making their way into the dim light from LastFM on the XBox.

Just outside the patio door, on the grass of the back garden a quick pitch tent stands, guarding our younger children as they sleep beneath the stars - their attempt to be like their older sister who came home from Guide camp today, after really sleeping under the stars for the last few nights.

I'm not quite sure what I am supposed to do in the event of an emergency in the middle of the night. Short of a Gruffalo attack (that can be defeated by a mouse, and a strong light source), I'm not really equipped for dealing with adventure and daring do.

It's heading past 1:30am. Friday is here, and I'm extending Thursday night. While wanting Friday to be here - to be over already - I'm also aware of work commitments stretching ahead like an ascent on Annapurna. I need more days, and may well end up bringing the work laptop home to pull the project back on course by force of will.

Sleep. I need to sleep.

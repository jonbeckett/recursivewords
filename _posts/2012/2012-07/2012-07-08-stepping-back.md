This weekend I finally decided to stop doing freelance web development work in my spare time. I've made my apologies to the client I have been working with recently, and am hoping to hand over the remaining work to a local developer (strangely enough, one I discovered through the girl who co-hosts the breakfast radio show in town).

When it comes down to it, spending time with my family is worth more than the odd bit of extra money that freelancing might earn. I should have done this some time ago, but a steady stream of people wanting help with their websites has kept drawing me back in.

I need to stop.

I need to read books again, watch movies again, and hang out on an evening with my better half. I need to stop being the guy sat in the study late at night pouring over screens full of programming.

I need to learn how to say "no".

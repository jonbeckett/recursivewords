While single handed today with two of our children at the weekend, I decided to combat the rain with a trip to see "Part of Me" at the cinema. It caught me totally by surprise, and I'm not too ashamed to admit having tears running down my cheeks more than once.

Throughout it's journey through Katy Perry's career and world tour, it was both exhilarating, and unexpectedly, profoundly moving. The moments before appearing on stage in Brazil were heart-wrenching. Our youngest tugged at my arm and tearfully asked (and I'm sure the entire cinema heard) "Why Katy crying?" all I could muster was a whispered "because grown-ups are mean sometimes", and held her hand. I looked across at our eldest, and she too had tear stained cheeks.

The moments that followed defined the movie, and "Katy Perry" for me - having patched up her stage makeup, and steeled herself, the elevator began lifting her into the screaming arena above, and the smile appeared.

"Part of Me" has got to rank as the most honest "fly on the wall" tour movie I have seen, and that's got to be worth something. Our eldest learned that while her idols appear larger than life, behind the facade they have the same fears as you or I.

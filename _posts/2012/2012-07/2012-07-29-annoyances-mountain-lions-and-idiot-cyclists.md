After much thought and deliberation (actually, very little thought, and even less deliberation), I've decided it might be better to not talk to anybody today. There are so many things annoying me, and so many people saying things that are either wrong, idiotic, or prejudiced, that it's just better to keep my mouth shut.

When I was young, my parents taught me there were three things you shouldn't talk about in public; money, religion, and politics. It turns out that many people using social networks have little concern over the thoughts, ideas and opinions they share - and even less regard for the audience they might subject to them. It's all about "me". My idiotic thoughts, my uninformed opinions, and my prejudiced views.

Listen to me. Trying to keep my mouth shut, and I'm carrying on.

I guess the thing that has annoyed me more than anything else in recent days is people choosing not to see, hear, or witness anything that doesn't agree with their carefully constructed world view.

In other news, I spent the greater part of yesterday evening re-installing my other half's Macbook. In doing so, I discovered the instructions given by numerous websites was either wrong, or the widely spread "truth" about Apple computers "just working" is an outrageous lie.After head-butting the table several times, and spending more money than I really wanted to, I prevailed, and we have a working Macbook again.

The upgrade to "Mountain Lion" will probably be it's last, because Apple has a habit of obsoleting hardware as quickly as possible to force upgrades. We are not buying another Macbook - the first indicator of where we might be headed in the future is the presence of "Google Drive" on all of our devices now, and the rejection of all the iOS and/or iCloud apps from the freshly installed machine.

The "drank the Apple cool-aid" fanboys will no doubt shake their heads at our behaviour, but I would perhaps observe that we have had just about every operating system out there on one device or another over the last few years, and something has become increasinly obvious; the days of the "platform" are disappearing quickly. Open protocols and standards have become more important than ever to combat the likes of Apple and Microsoft with their increasingly closed ecosystems.

I guess I should close this post with some kind of shout-out to the GB cycling team that failed to make any impression on the Olympic men's road race yesterday. Through no fault of their own, the rest of the field decided that if the GB team where anywhere near the head of the field at the finish, they would win - so they collectively threw the race - deciding that if they couldn't win, they would no way let the GB team win either. It was sad, cynical, and beggared belief.

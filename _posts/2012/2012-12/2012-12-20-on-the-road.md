While wandering the streets of San Francisco about ten years ago, we happened upon City Lights Bookstore, the legendary haunt of Allen Ginsberg, Frank O'Hara, and Jack Kerouac. At the time I knew little of the "Beat Generation" - only that they had changed the written word in much the same way that Elvis Presley and The Beatles had changed music.

Months afterwards, while trying to survive a daily commute into and out of London, I turned to books as an escape from the endless hours on trains, and picked up a copy of "On The Road", and it changed me too. Perhaps not in the same way as previous generations, but it changed me.

It opened my eyes to the idea that the journey might be more important than the destination.

This is going to be interesting... my first post from the Chromebook. It arrived at 6pm this afternoon just as I was giving up hope of seeing it today. The parcel tracking within the Amazon website reported nothing past midnight last night when it arrived at the local delivery hub (about 30 miles away). Just as I resigned myself to a repeat of the missing XBox 360 debacle and began helping with dinner, it arrived at the door.

So... a Google Chromebook. Bigger than a netbook, smaller than a laptop, lighter than a netbook, faster than a netbook, and twice the battery life of any laptop or netbook I've ever seen (and that includes a couple of Macbooks). It also cost half as much as the last laptop I bought.

The hope is that the Chromebook will encourage me to start writing again. I'm going to have to adjust a little to the keyboard (caps lock is replaced with a search button), but otherwise it's remarkably standard. I guess the whole point of the platform is that there's nothing to fiddle with - you just switch it on, and use the internet. The WordPress text editor suddenly earns it's money.

The next few weeks will be a journey of discovery. I'm not sure if Google Drive will become the primary repository of my files, but the 100 gigabyte gift that came with the Chromebook is pretty persuasive.

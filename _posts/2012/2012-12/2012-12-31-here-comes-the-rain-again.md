Mid morning, on New Year's Eve, and the rain is falling yet again. I was up a little after 9, washed up, fed the children, let the chickens out, fed the cats, cleared the kitchen, and have been camped out in the lounge with the Chromebook ever since.

While writing this, W has arrived downstairs, and is about to do battle with our eldest, who is into day five of wearing the onesie she got for Christmas. All she has done for the last three days is play Minecraft (saying that, I am no shining example - I played it yesterday evening for a couple of hours - there is no point to it, but I tell myself that it's a good de-stress tool; while you're building stuff within the Minecraft world, you don't really think about anything else).

Skip forwards an hour, and I've just put the bed away in the playroom, tidied the kitchen up again, moved the chicken food into the run to avoid pigeons stealing it, and am back in the lounge. The girls are upstairs playing with the various things they got for Christmas.

Maybe I'll get a relaxing day after all.

Ok... this is too funny not to record. Our Christmas tree this year is quite possible the worst tree ever seen by the human eye. A bauble just fell off it, and it dumped a dustpan full of needles as the bauble fell. We debated throwing the tree into the garden, but the kids will be so dissappointed, we're going to hold out until tomorrow.

Right... coffee... I need coffee...

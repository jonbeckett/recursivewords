Shakespeare said;

All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players: they have their exits and their entrances; and one man in his time plays many parts.

It has not been until recent years that the significance of these words occurred to me; that the parts might occur simultaneously. We each wear many hats, cross each other's paths, and we rarely get the chance to take stock - to see the true nature of the game we are participating in.

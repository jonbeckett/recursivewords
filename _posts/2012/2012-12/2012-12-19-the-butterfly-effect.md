I first experienced the writing of Ray Bradbury while at school - a chance english exercise, reading a collection of short stories called "Golden Apples of the Sun". One of the stories described a time travel "experience" sold in the future to intrepid travellers, where a tourist leaves the designated path, and steps on a butterfly."The Butterfly Effect"The literary giants surround us - in the words we read, the stories we tell, and the movies we watch.

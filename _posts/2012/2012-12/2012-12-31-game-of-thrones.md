After buying my other half the first season of Game of Thrones on DVD for Christmas, we have begun watching it over the past several nights. We are only four episodes in, but I can already sense an obsession coming - maybe not as bad as Community, where we watched the first three seasons inside a couple of months, or Big Bang Theory, where we watched an entire season in a couple of weeks, but the signs are there.

Not having read the book, I was expecting Game of Thrones to be based more around Sean Bean - purely because he appears in many of the posters. The complexity and depth of the characters - both central to the plot lines and incidental - has been a welcome surprise. I think perhaps so far Tyrion Lannister is stealing every scene. Yes, he's a despicable piece of shit, but he's a well intentioned piece of shit. I expect great things from him. There's also something about the blonde girl that has been married into the horse people's tribe (sorry... cannot remember the names) - I'm guessing she's going to become far more significant as the story moves forwards. Oh yes - Dragons - I'm guessing they are going to make an appearance, otherwise the eggs wouldn't keep featuring so prominently...

I gather Season 3 is already in production, so at some point we will catch up with the broadcast shows (and end up following the same path as a certain famous cartoonist to "Oatmeal" them, given the ridiculous methods HBO might have us go through to get them ahead of their DVD release). Until that happens, expect all manner of geeky posts about the plot, the characters, and the beautiful women of Westeros and Essos.

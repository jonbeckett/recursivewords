I can't believe the year is almost over. Last New Year is still fresh in my mind, and yet here we are again, buying groceries, and making plans with friends to see it in together again.

Being brutally honest, the end of this year has been hard on everybody. For the first time I can remember, we didn't even send any Christmas cards out to friends or relations. One event after another has crashed into us, with requirements to attend this, help at that, be seen here, or help organise some other mad fool event. The house has somehow stayed in one piece throughout - although the washing machine and dryer have discovered all about running through the night, because the early hours were the only ones we could find to do the normal things.

The old game I used to play, where you stay up to avoid the coming of tomorrow has somehow become the norm. We both do it. I can't remember the last time we were asleep before 1am.

Over the Christmas break, it has rained non-stop, day after day. I don't think I can ever remember rainfall like it. Along with the cabin fever, the children have all been sick too - the younger children coughing their lungs up over the last few days, and our eldest missing football match after football match throughout November and December with colds and coughs.

Perhaps we can redeem some good cheer on Monday evening; some good friends are visiting to see the New Year in with us. Hopefully finger food, wine, beer, and scandalous conversation will set us back on the right track.

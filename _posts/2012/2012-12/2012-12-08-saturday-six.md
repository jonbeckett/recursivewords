The kids are at the middle school Christmas Bazaar today. W is helping run Santa's Grotto, Miss 12 is doing stick-on tattoos, and the younger children are eating any rubbish they can lay their hands on. This afternoon Miss 12 is off to watch Wycombe Wanderers play football (soccer) with the rest of her team as a Christmas present from her coach. Tomorrow evening we are all going to the Pantomime with the Brownies, to watch Snow White. It's chock full of famous faces from television, and will hopefully make the children laugh themselves silly (who wants to be on to the adults laughing more than the children?). I won't be in the office at all next week - on Monday I travel to a client office and pretend to be clever for the day. For the rest of the week I travel to a Holiday Inn to be shown lots ofPowerPointslideshows by Microsoft. For four days. Shoot me now. The social/blogging experiment I built over at WeTheUsers is slowly but surely dying. It only took a few evenings to build, and it has been fun, but word of it's existence is not spreading. In many ways I am not surprised; if you give people the option of privacy, it also means they are undiscoverable. I have this afternoon unexpectedly to myself. I foresee a session on the XBox, which I haven't played for weeks. When I bought it, I also bought Fallout 3, Skyrim, and a number of other games - I haven't played any of them.

Got up at 5:30am, jumped in shower, then got dressed. While getting dressed did something to my lower back (don't ask how). Have been ambling around like an octogenarian all day. Left house at 6:20am, and trudged to train station in sub-zero temperatures without my Harry Potter scarf, because I couldn't find it (yes, I have a Harry Potter scarf - it's amazing). Arrived at destination at 8:30am after surviving a journey where the trains mysteriously connected with each other. The novelty has still not worn off. Morning coffee at 8:40am in random coffee shop (I didn't really wander the early morning streets of a tiny village wild eyed, in search of a coffee shop, honest). Half listened to 18 year old girl who - just - didn't - stop - talking. Pretended to be clever all day in spite of a very expensive technology product that repeatedly falls over, and makes you look like a numpty. I will be informing anybody that will listen in due course. Jumped back on trains to transport me home, and they kind of worked. Ended up stood on a platform waiting for one late train and had to stop sending messages via KIK because I couldn't feel my fingers any more (nope, I didn't have any gloves because I'm stupid like that). Arrived home in time to listen to bedtime stories - which reminds me - I still have a reading record to write up for our youngest.

The primary school our children go to has a rule stating that if your child has been sick, they are not allowed to visit school until the have not been sick for 24 hours. My other half took the day off yesterday, and I took the day off today to "keep an eye on her".

This morning I wandered into the younger girl's bedroom (Miss Seven and Miss Eight share a room), drew the curtains, and shouted "Time for Schoolat home, plugging away at several work projects while Little Madam watches Netflix, does colouring, plays with lego, and generally has a wonderful time.

She has appeared at my side from time to time - usually to request food, or a drink. Sitting down for lunch together would have been fun, but after I delivered food to the table she decided playing with one of the cats was much more fun, and declined to sit down. I carried my own lunch off to the study to carry on with what I had been doing.

Throughout the afternoon I have been wrestling with a client system several hundred miles away via a remote connection. In the distance I can hear Rex Harrison singing the songs from Dr Doolittle. In a short while my better half will arrive home, and begin trashing the house before we head out for an evening with friends.

At the moment I really can't get excited about going out (for dinner, and to see a play), but no doubt I will be enthused later, and will look back on this post with a wry grin.

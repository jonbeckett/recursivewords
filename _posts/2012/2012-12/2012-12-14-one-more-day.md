One more morning of getting up before the sun rises. One more day watching a seemingly endless round of lectures.

The saving grace of the last few days has been a small group of people I have kept in touch with via KIK while travelling - mostly from Tumblr. While Tumblr may have many failings, the people I have met through it over the years have become amazing friends.

On more than one occasion I have found myself stood in a crowd of commuters aboard a busy train, suppressing laughter as madcap messages arrived in my phone. I can only speculate what those close to me thought of the strange man in the duffle coat and Harry Potter scarf, grinning at his phone.

While wandering through Reading station on the way home this evening, I found myself walking a few yards behind a pretty girl. A hipster guy pushed past me in a seeming hurry to get somewhere, and then conspicuously kept pace at her shoulder... I couldn't quite believe what I was seeing at first, but as we walked the 100 yards along the platform and into the station, it became more obvious what he was doing....he was trying to make it look like they were together.

I started grinning - looking at my feet as I walked - I couldn't help it. I kept looking back up at them. She had no idea what was going on at all. It was only as we hit a crowd of commuters in the main concourse that his plan went awry - he got seperated by a hipster girl walking in the opposite direction who seemed intent on walking into as many people as possible.

While waiting in the near freezing temperatures for my next train to arrive, I busied myself with taking surrepticious photos of the train platforms. I would have posted them, but my work mobile ran out of data on it's monthly plan yesterday. KIK still seems to be working for text messages, but anything heavier apparently causes the phone to start eating itself.

Today ended with me brushing our younger girls teeth for them. They have been brushing their own teeth for years - but somehow tonight I ended up doing it. I should have taken a photo of the two little urchins, stood in the bathroom with grimaces on their faces as I pushed the toothbrush around their mouths in tiny circles.

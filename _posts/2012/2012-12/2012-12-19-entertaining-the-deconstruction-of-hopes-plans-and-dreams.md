Ernest Hemingway once wrote the following;

The world breaks everyone ... those that will not break it kills. It kills the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially. If you are none of these you can be sure it will kill you too but there will be no special hurry.

While the world isn't perhaps in a great hurry to kill me, I can't help wondering if it entertains itself in theoccasionaldeconstruction of my hopes, plans, and dreams...

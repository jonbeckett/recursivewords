I'm not entirely sure what happened to this weekend (well, I am, but I'm not impressed that it whistled past as quickly as it did).

Yesterday morning I dragged our eldest out of bed for football (soccer, for those of you on the other side of the planet).It's not lost on me that after playing for the town for a few weeks now, it's methat has to get her up, and make sure her kit is ready.She played OK. She's still learning (football practice is on tuesday nights), and still getting to know her team mates. This week they drew 3-3 with a visiting team, but could have won. I realised how good their coach is when he got them all together at the end - away from the parents - and lifted them dramatically.

The rest of the weekend seems to have been all about the washing machine, and school projects. I wish I had something exciting to report, but I really don't.

I was on cooking and cleaning duty today because my better half did one of those tricks where you wake up with a stiff neck and/or shoulder, with no idea why/how you did it. My cooking repertoire doesn't stretch much further than pie, chips and beans, so that's exactly what we had - and all the kids clean plated.

I'm not looking forward to tomorrow. I have to travel away againtomorrow night with work, to be at the client office in time for a meeting early on Tuesday.

Arse.

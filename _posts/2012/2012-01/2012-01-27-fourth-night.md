Tonight marks the fourth and final night in the hotel - I received word in the office this morning that I'll be released, and will be able to travel home tomorrow night. I called home while walking to the hotel this evening and informed Little Miss Eight - who proceeded to shout the news to everybody else.

I'm starting to flag. Today, one of the senior members of the team where I'm working caught me sat with my head rested in my hands, and asked if I was ok - as I looked up at him, he commented in broken English (he's german) "my god, you look exhausted".

I guess working as the sole developer on a huge project is beginning to take it's toll. Today I had to bring all my knowledge of systems infrastructure, workflow design, software development, and finally file transmission protocol security. It's too much.

I was invited out to a restaurant in Cheltenham tonight, but declined the offer. I freely admitted I wanted to just come back to the hotel and relax on my own.

I'm picking away at a pasta salad I picked up on the way home, sipping at a bottle of orange juice, and half thinking about a glass of the red wine I bought earlier in the week. It might sound like a crazy existence, but these simple pleasures are all I really need. I don't think I could face the hotel restaurant, or smalltalk with strangers.

It's funny - people always talk about how wonderful it might be to stay in a hotel with your work - to be away from the daily grind. They always forget that being away from everything really does mean everything - your family - your loved ones. There are no little people to give you a cuddle when you get in, to thrust school work at you, or to tell you about their day. There is no other half to sit watching TV with, with her legs flopped across your lap.

One day left. One day left...

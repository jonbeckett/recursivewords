Today was the first of three spent holed up in the study at home, taking part in an online training course for a technology platform I've been using for the last few months. It's the first time I have done product training remotely, and I'm not sure if I like it or not.

After racing to get the kids out of the door this morning, I sat down, sorted out numerous URLs, passwords, and things to install, and miraculously connected first time to both the trainer, his video feed, a remote desktop connection, and a training environment to play in (read: cause mayhem)

It occurred to me mid-way through the day how good some people are at educating. I guess I've come to realise because I've been called on to do it from time to timewhich gives you a greater appreciation for those that are good at teaching, versus those that are knowledgeable about a subject.

The "work" part of the day passed without incidentthe surprise was meor rather, how well I deal with working from home. After struggling to get the kids out of the house on time this morning, I didn't have enough time for a shower. For the entire morning I sat in on the virtual training course feeling really grubbysecond handrough around the edges. Needless to say, as soon as we broke for lunch I dived in the shower. You can't do that in the office.

So two days left. I'm wondering about touching base with the rest of the people in the course via LinkedIn. Most of them are members (I already checked). One of the guys from the course has already found me on Twitter too.

It's odd really. Even though we are seperated by thousands of miles, the social networks are creeping to the forehelping us reach out and forge connections.

The world really is getting smaller.

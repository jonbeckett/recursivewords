I overslept this morning. I had been planning on getting up not long after the children to hopefully deflect them somewhat from my parents. I appeared downstairs at 9, ready to make apologies and discovered the kids had already made and eaten their own breakfast, and my Dad busy making toast. Panic over. After a trip up the garden in my wellies to let the chickens out, we settled into a "do nothing" day.

Of course "do nothing" in this house is pretty different than most people's idea of doing nothing...

Got showered, dressed, and went to the playpark with the kids. Walked down to the sorting office to pick up a parcel with incorrect postage (Christmas presents for the children from their aunt - must remember to write thankyou notes) Turned straight around on my return to go and buy cream for pudding. Helped set the table, cook dinner, and amuse the kids Stopped W from having a meltdown after the kids distracted her and the potatoes turned to mush Sat down with everybody for dinner and ate like a horse Washed up everything from dinner. Made drinks, and watched a movie through the afternoon. Made sandwiches for everybody, more drinks, etc.. this evening Now sat here writing this

"Do nothing" my ass.

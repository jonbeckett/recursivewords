After dinner yesterday evening I suggested to my better half (having taken a brief look at World of Warcraft last weekend) that it might be a better chill out game than the endless succession of "run your own cake shop" games she has been playing late at night on the iPad.

Once the kids were in bed this evening we installed the client software on the Macbook, and I let the Windows machine finish it's install, before striding into the unknown.

An hour or two quickly became four hours, and I realised the draw of the "World of Warcraft" - it is indeed a very powerful drug. I don't know what I'm doing, I'm woefully ill equipped, underskilled and inexperienced, but for some strange reason I want to carry on with it.

While wandering through some virtual woods barefoot last night after a painful lesson in how trading practices work in the virtual realm, I stumbled upon an entire city filled with thousands of people, all going somewhere, doing something, or stopping to pass the time with each other. All real people, living somewhere in the real world.

My eyes have been opened. Warcraft is everything I had hoped, and everything I had feared. I fell into bed at 2am and dreamed of Griffons, armour, magic, and things that go bump in the night.

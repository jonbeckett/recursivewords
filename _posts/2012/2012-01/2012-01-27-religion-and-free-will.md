Why is it that - without exception - the people I know who believe in a God or Gods and visit church regularly seem to think there is nothing wrong in acting as an evangelist (as encouraged by their peer group) ?

Do they have no mind of their own? Do they always do what others tell them to do without question? What makes them think they can tell others what to do? What makes them think they can tell others what to think?

Over the years it has made me more and more angry.

In my mind, organised religion is just a hugepyramid scheme - the most successful one the world has ever seen. It opposes free thought and free will because they encourage people to think for themselves - and of course that leads to the curtain being pulled back.

Privately, I am horrified that in a time where education is so good that so many millions of people still believe in a collection of books of morality tales that have no provable basis in fact.

Maybe it really is easier for many people to be told what to do, rather than live their own life, make their own choices, and face the consequences.

There. I said it.

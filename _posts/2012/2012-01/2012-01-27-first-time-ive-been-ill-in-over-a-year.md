I'm not joking. It might even be 18 months. Sure, I've had colds. This feels more like flu though (I bet it isn't - but I have a creeping dread). I've had flu twice in my entire life, and it's not fun.

Unless there's some kind of miracle, I won't be at work tomorrow.

In other news, who knew that feeling like crap also erases any thought of writing deep and introspective blog posts about anything at all ? It's like all creativity has been sucked from me with a huge syringe, and replaced with ambivalence, or apathy.

I guess all I can do is sleep, and see what the morning brings.

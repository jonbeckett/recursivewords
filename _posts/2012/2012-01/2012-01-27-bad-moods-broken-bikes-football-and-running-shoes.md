I came home in a hell of a bad mood this evening. I would probably have been okay, but found myself picking up mugs, glasses, cups, plates and cutlery before I even took my bike helmet off. I left the taps thundering hot water into the sink while dumping my bag, coat and gloves in the study. I have to keep everything in the study - it's the only way of being sure where anything will be when required again - the rest of the house is a lottery.

W went to the chip shop while I washed up, and cleaned the kitchen. Quite how it gets in such a state between the end of one night and the beginning of another when there's nobody here is a total and utter mystery - it does though - every damn day.

The kids are now in bed and I'm drinking leftover sherry from Christmas while writing this. I can't drink much because guess what - I'm having no Saturday. While I need to take my bike in to get it fixed (crank bearings have gone), I will be stood at the side of a football pitch an hour from home watching our eldest play with the local girls team.

While it will be great for her to see her Dad watching, missing that one chance to take my bike in means I've also lost the chance for the greater part of next week too - because I won't have time in the week to take it in during the hours shops are open. By then the crank will be destroyed and will probably cost three times as much to repair, unless I do the hour walk each way to work.

Welcome to my life. A life where it takes two to three weeks to do anything I want. Everything revolves around everybody else. All the time.

This evening I bought running shoes to start running again. Somebody threw my last pair away while having a clear out. I'm not even looking forward to that - the only time I will find for running will be from 6am to 7am on a morning. Not fun.

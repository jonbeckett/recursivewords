I booked today off months ago, to attend my cousin's wedding. There's one problem - my cousin's wedding isn't until tomorrow. I'm not quite sure how that happened.

Instead of getting dressed into a suit this morning, instead I threw my jeans on once more, and wandered into town - first to get travel sick tablet for Miss Eight (who will either be fine, or will throw up like a fountain en-route to the wedding tomorrow), and then to get a new sketchbook, and some lunch.

I found myself wandering through three shops in search of Moleskine notebooks. In our local branch of WHSmiths I found "own brand" spiral bound notebooks, in the new stationers I found Italian rip-off Moleskine copies, and finally in the posh card shop in the high street (where I knew I would find them anyway), I discovered the rotary shelves filled with all shapes, sizes, and types of Moleskine notebook. Yes, they cost more, but they are also higher quality than any other notebooks on the market.

It's now somehow 2pm in the afternoon and I have done nothing with my day so far, other than load the washing machine and dryer, and tidy up a bit. Oh - I did find several episodes of Big Bang Theory that we haven't seen earlier, so later this evening I may surprise my other half with them.

What a tremendously boring blog post this was. It's no wonder I rarely write any more...

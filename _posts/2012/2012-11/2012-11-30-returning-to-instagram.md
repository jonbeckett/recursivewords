I re-joined Instagram earlier in the week. I'm not really sure why I did it, and I'm not really sure if it's a good idea or not. I don't seem to be sure about a lot of things any more.

When I was younger, I had definite opinions on thingsthe world seemed so much more black and white. As I've grown older, the world has been re-painted in shades of grey. There is always a counter argumentalways a fence to sit on.

I originally left Instagram when Facebook bought them, because I wasn't happy with the idea of the evil empire owning my photos in the same way that they own everything everybody posts to their hilariously broken social network. I can understand why they have to own everything; they are re-publishing it (and often re-purposing it) for the world to see.

I didn't set out to rant about Facebook, so will try to stop.

It all comes down to laziness. I can take pictures on my phone with Instagram, and it will hit Twitter, Tumblr, and Facebook for me. I don't have to visit each place to assist in curating the garbage I'm spewing out onto the internetI can just get on with the business of spewing. Which is good, right?I guess it all depends on the frequency and quality of spew and suddenly we're back onto the subject of our eldest daughter, who is at home again todayher fourth day of five off school sick.

If you are a fellow "instagrammer" (is that the collective noun?), feel free to visit the link below and add me, friend me, stalk me, "gramm" me, or whatever the hell you call it. http://instagram.com/farflungfriend

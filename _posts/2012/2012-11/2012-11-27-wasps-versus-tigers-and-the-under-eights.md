On Sunday afternoon we wrapped up warm and made our way to Adams Park on the outskirts of High Wycombe to watch the rugby - London Wasps versus Leicester Tigers. While "going to watch the rugby" would have been an excellent way to spend the afternoon on it's own, we had slightly more exciting plans - or rather, Little Miss Eight did.

As the clock ticked down towards half time, a number of children - our daughter included - made their way down to the edge of the pitch, and met their coaches there, before running out to a huge roar, and thunderous applause from the crowd. While many in the crowd made their way to buy beer and food, we sat grinning from ear to ear as our little girl charged around the pitch playing tag rugby with her team mates - providing a demonstration for all the children and parents in the crowd of what we spend our Sunday mornings doing.

The "real" rugby match was fantastic, and caused us all to become hoarse from shouting and cheering. The fact that Wasps (our local team) won capped off a fantastic day. Definitely something to do again.

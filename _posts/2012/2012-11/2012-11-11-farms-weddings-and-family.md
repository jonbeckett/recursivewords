On Friday morning we threw hastily packed bags into the car, and set out for a farm in Oxfordshire - our home for the weekend while attending my little cousin's wedding. The wedding had always seemed months into the future, and yet here it was.

We arrived shortly before lunch on the outskirts of Lechlade, found the farm on our second attempt (hidden behind a moss encrusted sign, tucked away from the main road), and sorted out complications we could really have done without. The cottage we were staying in was being photographed for next years brochures, so wasn't going to be ready until late in the day. We needed somewhere to get the girls changed (we didn't let them travel in their party dresses for fear of them being travel sick). We ended up preparing for the wedding in the back room of an old pub in the middle of Lechlade.

I drew 100 out of a cashpoint, and imagined it would be enough to cover the taxi to the venue, drinks, and the taxi home. I would be wrong. The taxi cost nearly 80 altogether... I was furious.

Anyway... hassles, expenses, and idiotic machinations aside, the wedding was wonderful. On our side of the family it was something of a re-union. Over the years our family has splintered and scattered across the country; it's incredibly rare to get many of us together in one place - and yet this wedding achieved it.

On more than one occasion as afternoon turned into evening, I found myself smiling as our girls followed the bride and groom everywhere. It didn't seem like so many years had passed since the bride was the little girl following me. Of course it has been more years than I like to recall; I'm no longer 17, and she is no longer 9.

Given our somewhat special status at the wedding - the only family with small children present - we found ourselves greeted with smiles, and batteries of camera flashes at every turn. The fact that we were first on the dance floor ahead of the official "first dance" probably had something to do with that too.

Just as the party seemed to be gaining momentum, our girls batteries started to run low, our taxi arrived, and we said our goodbyes. We travelled from village to village across Oxfordshire under dark, clear skies, and marvelled at the canopy of stars. The children spoke non-stop of their favourite memories of the night, before abruptly nodding their heads and falling fast asleep.

Weddings are a wonderful thing. There is such hope, enthusiasm, and good will wrapped up in them. They mark the start of something new, and sometimes the changing of the guard. Where family stories have been made and told by one generation, occasionally we get to see the next generation stepping up, and lifting the torch - writing the stories - the memories - for their own children.

There was a moment in the late evening when the groom was dancing with our younger girls on the dancefloor - bedecked in their sequined dresses, flanked by aunts and sisters crouching with cameras. I stood alongside an Aunt, and we smiled as we witnessed a possible future. The same man in ten years, dancing with his daughters at somebody else's wedding...

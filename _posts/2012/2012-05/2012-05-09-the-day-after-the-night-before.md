I'm rapidly discovering that burning the candle at both ends doesn't really work. It probably doesn't help that I'm not so much burning both ends, as throwing the entire candle in the fire.

After finishing various chores last night, and working for a couple of hours on a freelance project, I finally got around to playing with the XBox 360 (not before I wrestled with the XBox Live connection dropping out - I had to put it on a fixed IP address, and set the DNS servers to Google's before it started behaving itself). Big hint - staying up until 1:30am playing racing car games isn't very good for your health. I guess it might have helped if I had been able to sit down before midnight with it - but that's not going to happen for the forseeable future.

Aside from the XBox, I haven't been well at all for the last few days - neither has anybody else in the house. Of course I didn't tell anybody I didn't feel well - I just carried on. Nearly passing out when I arrived at work yesterday wasn't in the plan...

Anyway - lots to get on with at work.

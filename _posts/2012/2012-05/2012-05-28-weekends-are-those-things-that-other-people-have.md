Don't get me wrong - the weekend was tremendous fun, but it seemed to be centered around everybody else's fun.

Saturday evening was all about the Football awards evening for our eldest. She started playing for the town team this season, and although not perhaps the most talented footballer in the world, she is brave, dogged, and enjoys it. In truth, she is a far better netball player, and a far better dancer than a footballer, but we're not about to try and influence her.

I walked into town three times on Sunday - once to see my mother in law take part in the Marlow FM 10K run, once for groceries, and once more for more groceries.

Seeing the radio show presenters in the park was odd - they had only existed as voices in our kitchen at breakfast time before - and here they were, joking, laughing, and dancing to the music in the park on a Sunday morning. I'm now firmly in the belief that all female radio show hosts are gorgeous, and wear aviators - it must be in the job description.

I did manage to find time to sit and watch the Monaco Grand Prix on Sunday afternoon, but towards the end I was being shot dark glances by my other half.

During one of the trips into town I bribed the younger children into coming with me, in return for a trip to the toy shop. They ended up with a "sports day" kit for the garden, including sacks for a sack race, bean bags, plastic eggs, velcro straps for three legged races, and so on. Who knew that Miss Seven was going to be so damn good at everything. I started several of the events wondering how much I might have to throw them, and found I couldn't win.

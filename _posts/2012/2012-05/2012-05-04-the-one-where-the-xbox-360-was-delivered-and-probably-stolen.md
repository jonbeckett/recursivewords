A few nights ago I ordered an XBox 360 from Amazon, along with a few games. It would appear the XBox isn't going to get here because the delivery driver has either (a) lied and not delivered it yet, (b) lied and stolen it, or (c) left it without being signed for outside an office door that was open, and it's been stolen.

I can't quite believe that people are so incompetent.

I just got off the phone with the delivery company, who are going to try and get in touch with the driver. Apparently this might take 48 hours.

I'm furious.

Postscript - I called Amazon, and they arranged free, immediate replacement - to hopefully be delivered tomorrow. The order isn't showing on the Amazon account yet, so I'm guessing we'll have to wait and see.

Further update... Amazon processed the order 2 hours inside their own cut-off for next day delivery. It's "estimating" delivery tomorrow. Lets see if the delivery partner chosen this time can redeem themselves.

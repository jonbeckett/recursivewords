It's heading towards half past one on Saturday afternoon. The younger children are in the park in front of our house playing, the eldest is writing something at the dining table, the music player is pumping "Don't you forget about me" across the room, and I'm sat here dribbling garbage into the blog once again.

I have to stay in today while waiting for parcels to arrive - only I don't think they are going to arrive. Following the stolen XBox debacle yesterday morning, Amazon are supposed to be sending a second parcel. It was listed as "Dispatching soon" yesterday afternoon. It'sstill listed as "Dispatching soon". Having seen where the previous order came from, I'm not holding out much hope for it making it to me this afternoon.

The world seems to be conspiring against me at the moment. All I can really do is go with it, and accept the inevitable disappointment associated with pretty much anything I try to do (or cannot do because others expect me to either be elsewhere, or do something else).

I'm very close to walking away from Tumblr again - I guess you could say I'm in the "sitting on your hands" stage. It was broken for much of last night, and I really hate the new mobile app. It's utility has been diminished to the point that it's hard work to use or like. There comes a point when you start wondering if your efforts might be better spent elsewhere.

Anyway. The MotoGP qualifying session is on soon. A distraction from the washing machine, and child wrangling.

Come on Amazon! Improve my bank holiday weekend please!

Update... rather predictably, Home Delivery Network have not delivered the parcel. At 4pm this afternoon the "estimated delivery today" turned into "guaranteed delivery on Tuesday". So, in summary, they have stolen one parcel, and failed to deliver the next one on the date I pay for an Amazon Prime account to guarantee. F*cking annoyed doesn't even begin to cover it.

Of course now the parcel will arrive on Tuesday, and be delivered to my home address while I am at work. It will then either be left outside to be stolen, or go back to the depot.

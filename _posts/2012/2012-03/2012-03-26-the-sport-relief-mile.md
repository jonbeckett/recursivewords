The better part of Sunday saw the Beckett household (and W's Mum) turn out en-masse in Higginson Park to take part in the Sport Relief Mile. We were all up bright and early, wearing our branded socks, race numbers, and glitter balls. Arriving in the park I was surprised so few people were taking part, but then my only other experience of running events in town is the annual 5 mile race, that typically attracts several thousand runners from surrounding counties.

I ran with our eldest, W with our youngest, and W's Mum with Miss Eight. After a few minutes milling around at the start line, a beautiful athletic looking girl with a blonde ponytail made her way to the front of the crowd, and started shouting a countdown (which all the kids joined in with). Suddenly we were off and running.

I kept pace with Miss Eleven throughout the first half a mile, and she did really well - I had to keep telling her to slow down if anything. Her surprise at turning the final corner, and seeing the finish line out ahead of us was pretty amusing. After checking the route afterwards, I found out why - the "Mile" was only three quarters of a mile. I thought something was a bit strange because I've run it before with the kids, and the end was different - snaking around the field to add the extra quarter of a mile on.

I guess the distance wasn't really important - it was all about getting the children out and running. Hopefully next year I can talk our eldest into doing the three mile route (although, judging by the route, it will be a quarter of a mile short for every lap...)

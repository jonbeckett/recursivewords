It's 7am on Saturday morning. I've been up for the best part of an hour already. I've had a shower, tidied up a bit, and am looking forward to watching the F1 qualifying session from Malaysia in an hour. I still need to let the chickens out, wash up, empty the dishwasher, feed the cats, and despair at the mounds of craft materials littered all over the lounge.

I guess the faster I get on with everything, rather than sit here typing this, the faster I can sit down, have a coffee, and eat some breakfast. Which will cause more washing up.

I'm guessing little people will be up and about soon.

It never ends.

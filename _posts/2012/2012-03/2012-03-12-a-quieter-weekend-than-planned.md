It struck me this afternoon that I haven't written in this blog for whole days. Unheard of.

The weekend didn't turn out as we imagined it might. It all began when our eldest limped out of school after having fallen over playing some kind of idiotic playground game. After a trip to the Doctor to check for suspected broken ribs, she got the all clear and Football on Saturday morning looked very doubtful indeed.

Saturday (for me) became a day of avoiding arguments. I washed up, tidied up, and got shouted at for not spending enough time with the children. In response to that, I went out and played football with them - only to return home and get shouted at for not doing enough at home. Yay me. Sometimes it feels like all I do is what others demand, in order to avoid them being angry with me. I can't remember the last time I did anything for myself.

On Saturday night we attended a fantastic fund-raising evening to help support a friend's daughter who is going on an expedition to Greenland. The evening was dominated by a quiz - which I think we broke records in by scoring nothing in the first two rounds. I think we redeemed ourselves by outscoring every other team for the rest of the night though, and ended up third (of about 8 teams). We also ended up rather drunk.

Sunday was quiet. There were already signs that our youngest wasn't very well, and a quiet day seemed like a good idea. Goodbye any thought of going to the swimming pool. After making dinner for everybody, Sunday just seemed to ebb away.

Early in the hours of Monday morning, Miss Six arrived in the bedroom. I woke with the thump of her footsteps across the landing, and smiled as she climbed between myself and Wend. Moments after wriggling under the covers she was snoring. By the time everybody else was getting up, it was obvious she wasn't going to be in school. I received the call from W mid-morning...Tonsillitis.

Guess who's working from home tomorrow ?

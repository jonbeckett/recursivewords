In truth, I had completely forgotten about my birthday until a couple of days ago when W mentioned about her parents coming over today to come out for lunch with us.

"We're going out to lunch?"

"Yes..."

"Why?"

"What day is it on Saturday?"

I did the required mental gymastics, and a penny finally dropped from several miles in the air, landing with a tinkle in the distance.

"It's my birthday, isn't it"

I guess the next thought that went through my mind says a lot about me - I have been doing a fair amount of freelance work recently, and the freelance account finally has some money in it. Surely my own birthday is a really great excuse to blow some of it. On myself. I thought so too.

I woke up this morning at about 7am, greeted by the insane grins of our younger two children - wedged into the bed on either side of me.

"Happy Birthday Dad! When are you coming downstairs?"

"In a minute"

"Aww... we want you to come down now!"

"Why?"

"Because we want to see you open your presents!"

"I have presents?"

"Yes!"

After perhaps twenty minutes of negotiation, W finally cracked and stormed from the bedroom like a particularly annoyed badger. This is normal. Miss Eight piped up "Now look what we've done".

I finally rolled from bed, and rubbed my eyes.

Arriving downstairs I found several small parcels and cards waiting on the corner of the coffee table, with an audience of little people watching expectently. They don't warn you about this in the parent instruction book - the evident pride that little people show when you open theircard, and read their words.

I almost had a wibbly lip moment as I read Little Miss Six's card, which congratulated me on my 93rd birthday, along with "Happy Birthday Dad hope you have a lovely day" perfectly written inside...

Early in the hours of Monday morning I snapped awake to the sound of footsteps between the bedrooms. Without opening an eye, the footsteps wandered slowly into our bedroom, and then somebody small and silent climbed onto the bed, and wiggled between us.

Neither of us said a word. As I rolled over, I saw W's arm lift over the new lump in the bedclothes - a few moments later the lump began snoring.

By the time we all got up, the little person had gone back to her own bed, and was bathed in sweat. W called work, and resigned herself to a trip to the doctor.

I received the call at lunchtime - "she's got tonsillitis". Great.

After looking at both our schedules, and running here and there to get permissions, I arranged to work from home the next day - forming a bizarre tag-team. Of course in the grand tradition of sick children, after a sleeping throughout Monday, and then playing craftily educational games all Tuesday at home (next to me at the dining table while I wrestled with C# and PHP), she bounced back.

By Tuesday night the "bad throat" had turned into an excuse to try and get her sister in trouble. Apparently if your sister takes something from you out of plain sight, you scream blue murder and claim she hit you in your bad throat... dismissing said claim as rubbish causes unintelligible wailing and blubbing.

She's better. That's all that matters.

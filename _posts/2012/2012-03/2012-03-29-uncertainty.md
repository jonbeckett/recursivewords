News broke this morning that the company I have been working with recently has had the carpet pulled from under it in a sudden and dramatic manner.

It feels strange.

Even though my interraction with the staff was entirely professional, we had started to get to know one another - the bonds of friendship had begun to form. Seeing the news, and figuring that so many of them would be facing an uncertain future today made me feel strangely sad.

I've emailed a few with my non-work contact details in order too keep in touch in the future - swapping Twitter, Google+ and LinkedIn addresses.

Fingers crossed things turn out well.

I quite accidentally got back in touch with an old friend recently. She worked at a web design company in San Francisco back in the dot com boom, and somehow we became friends. The friendship survived the next ten years, although chances to catch up with each other became increasingly infrequent. Life happened to both of us.

You can imagine my surprise then when a chat window popped open late one night, and suddenly the years were wiped away. We were like carrots and peas again.

I guess the point I'm making is that I had forgotten how much friendship can sometimes mean. When we have a hard day (or week, or month), it's useful to escape into the computer - the internet - and seek out those who know us only as ourselves. In the real world we have innumerable requirements, expectations, and distractions surrounding us; in the online world we have nothing. We stand alone.

What am I saying here? Maybe that I need to take part in Tumblr more.

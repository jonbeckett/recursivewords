While making a cup of tea for my co-workers this morning, I stood daydreaming at the kitchen window - wondering if I should write a few minutes worth of thoughts into the blog every morning. Empty my head before the strains of the day take their toll.I very much doubt I would have enough to share everyday, but it's a nice idea.

It's Wednesday morning. Halfway through the week. When I left the house this morning it was just cold - by the time I reached the office fifteen minutes later I had been pelted with freezing mist-rain for the last mile, and was soaked to the skin. A few moments after arriving the wonderful girl that sits behind me arrived - wrapped like an eskimo - and remarked on the bike ride she didn't witness.

Yes, I am cold and damp. I guess I will dry out in time to go home, when the same cycle will be repeated. If I had half a brain, I would have been wearing waterproofs - but no. I'm not thatclever.

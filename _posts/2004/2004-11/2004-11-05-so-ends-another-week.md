This week has been rather busy!

It's late on Friday afternoon and I don't really have enough time to work on anything earth shatterinly complex - so I find myself writing in my blog.

Yesterday I was at a client site in London installing software... well, actually showing their staff how to install the said software. I left the house in the morning at 7am, and got home at about 7:30pm. Long day. The one good thing about commuting to client sites is that I get to read books while sat on the train.

Yesterday's book was "Do Not Pass Go" - I've been reading it for a while (keep picking it up and putting it down). The guy who wrote it basically toured the city of London by way of the Monopoly board (if you have never played the board game, you will be totally lost at this point). The book explores what each place on the board is really like, and digs into the reasons it might have been chosen way back in the early 1900s for inclusion in the game.

The same author also wrote a book called "French Revolutions" where he cycles the route of the Tour De France... another interesting, and at times hilarious book.

So what does the weekend hold? I guess it's mainly going to be development work on my CMS system - it turns out that the major (potential) contract that will be using it is now a major (actual) contract - the company I work for won the bid.

Looks like I'm going to be rather busy, doesn't it.

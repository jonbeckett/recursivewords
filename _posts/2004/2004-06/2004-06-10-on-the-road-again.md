I went for a run this morning - the start of my training for the 5K runnning race W has entered me into during July. I set off at about 7:30am, and did about a 2 mile lap around town, deliberately going slowly to avoid being too knackered towards the end - I didn't stop to walk though, which was good 

I have the rather boring aim of being able to run for 30 minutes in time for the race - meaning I should be able to run around the course fairly easily without stopping (of course, the hidden agenda is that I will go off training and pushing myself really hard once my base fitness is a bit better - see how fast I really can do 5K).

It's weird, I know if I stick at it for a while and get a bit better at it, I'm going to be okay at running (well, okay for me). I used to be pretty good at cycling, but the only hangover I've got from that is big thick legs - which of course are the anti-thesis for running. Of course it doesn't help that I'm carring about half a stone around my middle that doesn't need to be there either.

So - away from my mad running attempts, what else is going on today?

We're off on Holiday next week to Newcastle (upon Tyne) in the north of England. It's going to be a great chance for a break and I'm really looking forward to it. I just have to get through the rest of today and tomorrow at work, and I can look forward a week off. Plans at the moment are to take a couple of books, and maybe my laptop to play chess against (in reality, I may just take my Palm organiser, because it has Chess on it).

While we're in Newcastle, we're actually staying in a little cottage on the east coast. I'm just hoping that we don't try and do too much while we're away - I'm looking forward to the rest really.

If you're wondering why I'm writing this boredom inducing tome in the middle of the afternoon, it's because I am defragmenting the "virtual hard disc" in a "virtual machine" - and if you're wondering what that is, look up VMWare on the internet.

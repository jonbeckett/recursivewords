Yes, that's right - the mind-numbing phenomenon that is Big Brother is back on our TV screens in the UK, so I have decided to make a website for it 

If you visit http://www.pluggedout.com/bigbrother you will see the forums - feel free to join.

I'll keep the forums up and running during this series of Big Brother. If you see any good pictures on the internet to do with BB, feel free to post them to the "Pictures" forum on the site.

Anyway - I better get on with some work!

With little or no advertising on the internet (basically, a couple of newsgroup postings), people seem to be finding their way into the forum I built for Big Brother... except of course nobody is bothering to take part.

I kind of anticipated nobody would be bothered with posting anything - mainly because Big Brother is amazingly boring, and nobody really wants to admit to watching it... the telltale of course is that the picture of "Shell's" bum has nearly a hundred hits as I write this. How predictable was that?

My normal work has gone pretty well today - I've broken the back of one of the more difficult areas of the workflow system I have been working on - but the internal mechanics of it really are starting to resemble one of those mainframe wiring looms from a Cray... (if you haven't seen one, think cooked spaghetti). In reality, the design is quite simple and elegant - there's just a LOT of it, and it's using simple ideas on a large scale.

Changing subject wildly, last night I spent all night fixing somebody's computer for them - they had got hold of a second hand Win98 machine - I had intended to re-install Win98 on it, but discovered their CD was damaged, so basically had a huge cleanup operation on my hands... it's amazing what crap people install on PCs (or perhaps I have a hangup about hard drives being clean and tidy?). Anyway - following several hours sorting it out, I removed tons of software, cleaned up the registry, de-fragged it, sorted out a browser and internet connection, and installed AVG Antivirus on it to protect them from nasties. I suspect the machine will only be used for webmail anyway, so it's not really a problem.

Tonight I'm hoping to have a bit of a relax with my other half - although I might find myself doing some screen grabs for BB to see just how shallow the visitors to the forum are

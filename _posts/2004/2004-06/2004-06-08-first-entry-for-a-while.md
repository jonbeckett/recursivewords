I'm constantly amazed how many people read this blog, and sometimes guilty that my entries are somewhat patchy in frequency... perhaps it's because there has been so much going on just recently?

On Thursday night last week we had friends over for a meal, on Friday night we had more friends over for a meal, then on Saturday we ended up doing nothing (something to do with getting to bed at 3am on Saturday morning). Sunday was taken up with a visit to Oxford for W to take part in the "Walk of Life" in St Giles, then yesterday it was back to work and something like normality.

This week I am basically counting the days down until we go on holiday - we're off to Newcastle in the north of England next week for a family re-uinion (W's Dad's side of the family). In true holiday fashion, the weather in the UK this week is amazing - touching on 30C, but I'm betting while we're away next week we will have the biggest cold snap in history.

At work at the moment I am working on the same humungous project that I've been working on for months - and it's getting closer to "go-live" slowly... I wasn't helped yesterday when VMWare crashed on me and I lost 4 hours worth of programming (I know, I know, I should have saved)... reminds me of a joke about Jesus in a programming competition and the power cuts out with 5 minutes to go... of course Jesus wins because "Jesus Saves" 

Anyway - time to go do nothing for the rest of my lunchtime I guess...

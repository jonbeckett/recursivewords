At the moment it really does feel like I'm working night and day... in the daytime I am working on a logistics system for a corporate client, and in the evenings I find myself working on my own project, CMS...

I think the hard work may pay off fairly soon - CMS is becoming feature stable at last - I just need to have a last push to get the code documented nicely and wrap it up in an installer.

Away from the world of computers, we spent all weekend decorating at home. We managed to get the stairs and part of the landing wallpapered and painted. I also cut and fitted skirting board and architrave for the hallway and lounge - the lounge has been without any for the past 18 months 

Late last week we had a power cut at work and I ended up playing my first "over the board" game of chess for years against a colleague - and amazed myself by systematically wiping him off the board. There was this moment before any pieces had even been taken when he sat for a while, thinking, and then said "things aren't going very well for me, are they"... haha - I was secretly chuffed to bits that my playing on the internet had helped me with over the board play 

Anyway - I have this logistics system to be getting on with!

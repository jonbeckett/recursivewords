For the first time in a few weeks I'm actually feeling okay. Still not 100%, but getting there 

Today things are going well on the project I'm working on at work, and my open source stuff on the internet is going okay too. I'll be releasing the CMS system at some point later in the week - this has kind of been made necessary by a project I'm doing on the side using the CMS code. If you are at all interested, go look at the forum for CMS (http://www.pluggedout.com/development/forums/viewforum.php?f=14).

I dusted off my Sega Saturn at the weekend and re-discovered just how addictive games like Virtua Fighter and Fighters Megamix are  After a couple of hours I was able to complete the arcade mode in about 8 minutes... not bad going for an old git! (I seem to recall I could finish the game in under 5 minutes when I was younger). Playing the game really brought it home to me just how much the game matters - although the new generation of consoles have amazing looking games, they game is all that really matters. I guess something like "Asteroids" or "Pacman" is a good example.

Oh - more newsI won a four player "all play all". It looks like I'm in with a chance of winning another big tournament too, so perhaps I'm not quite as bad at chess as I thought I was 

Time to get on with some more work I guess...

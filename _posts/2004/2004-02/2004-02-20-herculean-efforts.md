I was up until 1am programming again last night - the CMS code is now up to version 0.3 in the development area. Although you can't see any difference at all in the user interface, the code behind the administration interface has had a complete overhaul.

This probably won't make any sense to anybody who isn't a professional software developer, but I'll tell you anyway - I spent the entire evening moving all of the admin interface into library functions that output the HTML. It's an aesthetic thing really, but it really helps a lot in managing the code, making it extendable, and tracing problems.

I have one more piece of functionality I want to build into CMS before I wrap it up as an installable system - content templates. At the moment I have page templates which influence the entire page, but not templates that influence a single piece of content. They shouldn't take too long to implement, so I expect tonight might see a new release if things go well.

Anyway - I guess I better get on with some of my real work!

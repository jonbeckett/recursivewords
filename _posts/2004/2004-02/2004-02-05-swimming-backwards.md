I feel like I'm swimming backwards at the moment. There are so many things I want to be getting on with (such as the CMS content management system project that's been stalled forever, and multiBlog, which hasn't even got past the start line... and then of course I would love to write a document management system with PHP and MySQL, but the chances of ever having time to do that are remarkably slim...

Do you think I take on too much?

At present I'm sitting here at work, after spending the greater part of the day re-installing a server on a client site. Their original system was working fine right up to the point where somebody else installed something on it - and hay presto, our stuff didn't work any more...

It has to be said that the new server they have aquired for the job is the fastest Windows based machine I have ever seen - it did cost 7000ukp though. Get this - twin 3Ghz Xeons with 512Mb level 1 cache each. 2Gb main memory, RAID, UPS... you name it, this server has it. I timed it on reboot - even with getting the SCSI raid drives up and running, it was booting in less than 20 seconds. Incredible. It even serves dot net applications impressively quickly.

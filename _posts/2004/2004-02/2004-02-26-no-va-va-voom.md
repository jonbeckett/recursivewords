Over the last couple of days I have been suffering from what I can only describe as a terminal lack of "vavavoom"... I guess the real word for it would be "apathy" - and another term would be "can't be bothered".

Take last night for instance - I got home from work, did nothing for about an hour (well... I did the washing up), then had something to eat, then messed around on the internet for a couple of hours before going to bed. Even the "messing around on the internet" mostly consisted of playing chess or reading about the Formula One testing...

I guess I'm just tired because I'm working on a big project at work (probably the biggest one I've ever worked on), and I'm developing it single-handed. My project manager only turns up to check progress once in a blue moon, and the only other person who has a clue about what I'm working on is out of the office quite a bit at the moment.

It's a bit mad really.

Anyway - I have to go and look at some prospective birthday presents on Amazon - I'll be the grand old age of 31 next week.

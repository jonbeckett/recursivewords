Hi all,

If you have been wondering why no patches have been done to the Blog for a while, I can finally tell you why. I have been working on something else.

CMS stands for "Content Mangement System". If you have ever looked after a website and got fed up with receiving text or pictures from people, and having to upload it all, you've probably wished you had some kind of database driven system where the users can log in and update it themselves - CMS does that.

I have been working on it for quite a while (although time has been at something of a premium just recently), and it's getting to the stage where I feel I can package the scripts up and give them out without too much risk of things not working as intended. We're still only at version 0.2 of the scripts though 

I've made a discussion forum for the CMS scripts, which you can visit at the URL below;

You can also see the "live" development version of the system at the following URL;

Enjoy!

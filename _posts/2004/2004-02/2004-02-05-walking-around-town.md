I've just got back from a training walk with indychick - she's doing a marathon distance walk later in the year to support a cancer charity. Normally the evening walks are about 45 minutes around town at a brisk pace - and if she can't find anybody to go with her, I usually fill in (call me old fashioned, but I don't like the idea of her walking around town on her own in the dark).

Tonight I may well spend some time getting the pluggedout webspace back into some kind of order - I've re-arranged where everything should go, and it's now just a case of making sure the links between pages make sense.

Actually - I just realised; I've written nothing in here about the Chess website that I've become addicted to - it can be found at www.letsplaychess.com, and is basically a correspondence chess thin client. Go have a look yourself if you like playing chess - it's great fun.

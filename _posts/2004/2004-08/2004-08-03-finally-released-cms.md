I finally released the CMS "Content Managment System" code to the internet this evening - although it's worth pointing out that it's still only at version 0.2.

If you have no idea what I'm talking about, CMS is an open source website management utility I've been picking away at in my spare time. It's probably worth letting on that the PluggedOut website uses CMS. The main idea is to help anybody make their website in a much more flexible way than authoring on their development computer, and uploading via FTP. CMS basically lets you author and edit content from anywhere you have a browser connected to the internet, and it supports multiple users with varying security profiles.

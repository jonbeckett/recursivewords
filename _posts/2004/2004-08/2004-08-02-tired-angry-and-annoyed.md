I really didn't want to get up for work today. I had thoughts about going running first thing this morning, but my alarm went off at 7am and I didn't get out of bed - so that kind of killed that idea.

It's now 5:28pm. I wrote the above paragraph at 8:55am this morning, and this is the first chance since then that I have had to do anything other than work my backside off on a really depressing web development project. I'm really annoyed. Read on if you want to know why.

A couple of days ago I probably wrote about a commercial site I've been working on that's using my content management code. I was really pleased to be working on a web design project at last - however I was mistaken. I have been working on a web development project - not a web design project.

After getting the majority of the website up, looking good, and working well, we showed the client. The client then proceeded to send instructions for a number of changes that have basically turned the site from a professionally produced "nice" website, to something looking like a school child did. Imaging the chassis of a Maserati with a body made of out shopping boxes and sticky tape. It's really annoyed the hell out of me.

We even had arguments over the "design" of the site. They wanted the screen templating to look like a car chassis - so I went to town on metalwork, panels and joints to go behind and around the screen real-estate, being careful in the process to keep the design looking clean and uncluttered. Following two days of effort on that and ending up with a really good look and feel for the site, the client came back with "can we just have it how our original concept sketch looked?" (their original concept was probably done by somebody straight out of school with half an hour's Microsoft Paint experience - plus it used several thousand lines of Javascript to do what I managed to do in under 50 lines).

Aaarrggghh. I'll calm down later.

Today myself and my colleague/manager CH were supposed to drive over to a large automotive company to show them their newly installed workflow system... except CH pulled the plug at the last minute. Here's why...

We finished "principal" development of their workflow about a month ago. A lot of the final development couldn't happen until the systems it talks to are in place; they were not. Luckily I had other projects to get on with in that time, so effectively have not seen, worked on or even looked at the code for a month.

Then yesterday afternoon they called out of the blue and said "our data is in place - are you still on for the go-live tomorrow?"... they get a month to prat around, and we're expected to pull the rabit out of the hat in one evening...

We stayed until 9pm last night working on the workflow to try and get it talking to their brand new (and virtually empty) systems... pretty much unsuccessfully... then went home expecting to go on-site this morning and have nothing to show them. CH decided at 9:00 this morning that it was a waste of everybodies time, so we pulled out at the last minute.

So - I am now sat here at work in my full penguin suit, while everybody else is in shorts and t-shirts. It's incredibly hot too.

At least the pressure is off a bit now.

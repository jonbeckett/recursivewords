I had heard a guy at work talking about an internet telephony package called "Skype", but didn't look at it until earlier on today - and am amazed to say that even I was impressed with it.

Skype (www.skype.com) is a piece of free software that lets you make phone calls on the internet - and (via a pre-paid account) to land lines.

I just called my cousin in California (I'm in England) and it cost about 2 cents a minute (Euros, which are roughly equivalent to dollars).

If you call from Skype to Skype, it's free - so if she installs it on her computer I can talk to her as much as I want 

Everybody install Skype, and add me as "jonbeckett73" - it's great

This blog has been sadly lacking new entries just recently, so this is the start of an attempt to put that right.

Over the last few weeks, I have variously been flat out at work, at Cambridge on a training course, and taking a week off to travel up and down the country with W.

This week I got back into the office for Monday, and then was immediately packed off to Hillingdon on Tuesday, and then Swindon on Wednesday to work on-site on client projects.

Today, finally back in the office for what feels like the first time in ages, most of my day was spent with reporting progress on the fly-away projects, talking about future projects, and dealing with admin (including 450 in expense claims 

Anyway - I guess I'll write later about what happened during my wonderful stay in the Holiday Inn in Cambridge a couple of weeks ago... if you can stay awake past the first few sentences.

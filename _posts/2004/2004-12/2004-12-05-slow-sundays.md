Today is Sunday, and I am working on CMS once more. I now have the document management system database designed and built, and am starting to look at doing some administration pages for it.

I'm still messing around with Skype - I just need to convince my friends to all use it now. The sound quality seems to be really good - so far this morning I have had conversations with a woman in France who called me by accident, and a systems engineer in China working for Dell.

The shocking thing so far is the sound quality - if you both have broadband, the sound is as good as them sitting in the room with you - although there may be up to half a second delay with some countries (China was more affected than France).

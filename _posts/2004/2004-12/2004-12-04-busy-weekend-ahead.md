The requirement to use the CMS project at work has finally started to appear, which means I now have to get the "missing" parts of the puzzle in place. It means I'm going to be "head down" for the next few days working on various sections of the code, but I don't really mind; it means a lot of money for me in the long run.

As CMS has become a bigger project, I've had to start installing things on my development machine at home that most people wouldn't expect - things like a "Revision Control System" (CS-RCS), which basically keeps track of new versions of the CMS files in case I nerf things up spectacularly at any point. I've also gone and registered a copy of Handy Backup, and am about to purchase Diagram Studio - a nice diagramming tool that I'm increasingly needing to draw up database schema diagrams.

CMS (which stands for "Content Management System", incidentally) started out as a solution for my own website because I was fed up of using FTP packages, but it's increasingly become something of a leviathan - with more functional possibilities than I ever envisaged when I started out.

In truth, the major "new" section of CMS will be the document management features - which could possibly be forked into their own project, but I want to keep things simple. It would be nice actually to have a DMS interface implemented through CMS.

Anyway - I better get on!

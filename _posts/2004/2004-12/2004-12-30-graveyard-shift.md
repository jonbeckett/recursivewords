Today is Thursday 30th December, and I am at work on the "Graveyard Shift" - covering the phones between Christmas and New Year.

I am the only developer in. There are currently two other people in the entire building (that I have seen so far) - C and D... remember I'm not going to give any names away 

I have my little radio W bought me for Christmas pumping out BBC Radio 2 across the office, although I guess I could get away with Internet Radio today with so few people being in the office.

Perhaps my new years resolution should be to write more in my blog. To be honest though, with the IVF stuff not working, he whole of December hasn't really happened for W and myself - we've been kind of numb to Christmas this year. We spent the few days over Christmas at my parents in Cornwall, and used it as a chance to hide away from the world - reading books, playing board games, and basically having a really quiet time on purpose.

Changing subject wildly, I had a call from my brother in law yesterday that he bought himself a laptop for christmas - so when we go over for New Years, my first job will be to setup his wireless networking  I need to get in touch with him today to find out exactly what he bought.

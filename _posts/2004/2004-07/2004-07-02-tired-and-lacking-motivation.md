Listless

This afternoon for some reason I have been very, very tired indeed - and because of it have been lacking any motivation what-so-ever to do any serious work.

I've kind of crunched through and got all the templates in place for a website I'm working on (a big commercial job with content management and so on), but haven't really had the mental energy to do more than the mundane tasks. My head is just not in it today.

Feeling Lost

At lunchtime today I went for a "wander" around the net to see if there are any sites I might like to take part in... recently I've been kind of lost on the internet - as many of you will know I used to run a really big site, but since I closed it down have not really done anything. I need to find something to focus on...

If anybody was wishing there was a particular site out there, let me know your idea - I'm in the somewhat privilaged position of knowing how to build anything - I just haven't figured out what my next project should be...

An idea of sorts...

I did have one idea the other day - in the ICQ website there is a "chat requests" page - how about a site that lets people leave chat requests for any/all the various chat programs... so you basically leave an entry saying "I'm known as jonbeckett73 on Yahoo Messenger, and will be online for the next 45 minutes accepting chat requests..." - and the site takes care of sorting and pruning the list of requests.

It's a really simple idea, but I think it might just work.

Hitting the keyboard again...

The alternative thing I might have a go at is writing. I haven't done any writing for a long, long time and used to really enjoy it. Perhaps if I find a writing community on the web that I like (that gives out writing exercises) I might go and take part. If anybody knows of any, let me know!

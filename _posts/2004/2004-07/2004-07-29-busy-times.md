It would appear that there is something of a pattern to these journal entries. There have not been many posts recently, and while pondering on this a reason struck me. I tend to write blog entries when I am not fed up with the IT world. Today I am not fed up. Recently I have been, and for a very simple reason - I've been very busy indeed.

Work has been very hectic. I've been lead developer on two fairly sizeable projects - one is the website for an automotive dealer network, and the other is an order "logistics" system for a huge truck manufacturer (obviously I can't name the companies involved).

The website is quite interesting because it's using the CMS code I have developed in my own time (and available from www.pluggedout.com). CMS stands for "content management system", and is basically a few scripts that help manage really big websites; it does away with the need to use FTP, and in really big sites, you can re-use content to your heart's content. It uses templates too, so the whole look/feel of the site can be changed from wherever I am whenever I want as long as I have an internet connection.

The CMS code went through quite a steep development curve prior to it's use on the commercial website project; there were quite a few things it didn't do - such as handling security of multiple users editing the content (it means you need types of content and types of user - as well as having a back door login of course).

I'm being really boring, aren't I. King of the geeks.

Changing subject really rapidly because I've just realised how boring the start of this entry is, we went to see Spiderman 2 last night. Fan-bloody-tastic. I love comic book type films (and no, I don't own many comic books). Actually, I have to admit to loving comic book artwork; and the titles at the start of Spiderman 2 were abso-f*ing-lutely-brilliant. I'm not sure because I haven't checked yet, but I'm pretty sure the artwork at the start of the movie was drawn/painted by Alex Ross. I'll probably get shouted down by some comic officionado now 

What else is going on?

I'm feeling rather up-beat because I was expecting something of a nightmare today at work; I though I would be pulling an all-nighter to get the truck manufacturer project installed and running ready for user acceptance testing tomorrow. That has all gone out of the window now though - one of the major sections of the code is not written yet (the bit that starts a huge workflow, and picks data up from a few big financial systems). I can't write that code until we have the systems to write the code against, and those systems just don't exist yet. The whole thing has been re-scheduled for next Thursday now, giving me a nice amount of breathing space to relax and enjoy my weekend.

So there you go. Something of a quick catch up entry. Feel free to comment and call me a boring geeky bastard

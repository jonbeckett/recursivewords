This evening I am holed up in the front room of the house with my laptop, working on changes to the CMS system to make it more suitable for commercial use.

In the meantime, feel free to go and post entries in the Blog guestbook! - I programmed it last night in a fit of boredness. If you can't find it, scroll down the page a bit and look in the left hand margin.

If all goes well this evening, the CMS system will end up with version control of content, and user security - meaning that particular users get particular privilages to do things to particular types of content. On top of that, some types of content will require "approval" before they go live - meaning a simple form of workflow will come into being.

I'll touch base with this blog late this evening to give an update on progress.

21:47 : I've had enough for the evening. I have everything designed, and two thirds of the programming done.

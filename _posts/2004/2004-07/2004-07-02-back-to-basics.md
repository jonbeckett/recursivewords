I decided this evening to do a bit of a make-over on my blog script. Out go all the table parameters, and in come nice, simple CSS tags.

I still haven't got rid of the tables entirely - there are still some things that you just can't do with div tags - but at least I've styled the table elements with CSS.

At some point over the next few days I might implement some graphics or other, but for the moment I think it looks fine.

On another point, can somebody please let on why on earth anybody reads this blog? I check the Diarist Clix page now and again, and am constantly surprised that I rank so high up. My blog is boring! It's hum-drum stuff about a pretty normal chap getting on with a pretty hum-drum life... why!?

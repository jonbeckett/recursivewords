Aren't sunday mornings great... I finally got up at just gone 9 this morning, and have sat here with a cup of earl grey and the internet for the last hour... it's now gone 10, and I'm still here in my dressing gown.

W just got up, and is sat across from me working on some knitting project, with a cup of tea and her pyjamas. I've got headphones on and am listening to the "Pirate Radio KQLZ" station on WinAmp.

I think the plan for the day involves driving over to Didcot to have lunch with W's family. I'll probably take my palm pilot or laptop over to give me something to do - it's not that I get bored over there; more that there is absolutely nothing for me to do apart from talk to W's brother, and once he dissappears off somewhere I'm kind of stuck. At least if I take my palm pilot I can play chess 

I think I probably have officially the scariest hair in the world this morning. It seems to be something I am very talented at - scarey hair. I don't really know what goes on in the night, but perhaps the alien equivalent of vidal sassoon flies in through the windows and does a first class horror job on me in the night... every night. It really is bizarre. People would pay for hair that sticks out at the angles mine does on a morning.

Anyway - I guess my blog needs some graphics on it really; I'll have to see what I can come up with.

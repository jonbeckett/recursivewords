I went for my second training run of the week this morning - another 5K under my belt in preparation for the race I'm running on Thursday night.

So far I've only jogged around the 5K to get the distance into my legs - on Tuesday's final run, I'll probably run out quite gently, then put the power down for the second half of the run - see just how fast I really am.

My legs seem to be recovering well from run to run - I'm taking a day out between each 5K run to give the tendons a chance (I have to be careful because I damaged a leg a couple of years ago taking part in the Marlow 5 mile race).

The scary thing I discovered while out running today was that I could have gone a lot further. The first couple of miles were difficult, but after that I found I had quite a bit left and could probably have gone out to 5 miles. It would probably have taken me the best part of 50 minutes to run that far (because I did the first 3 so slow), but still, I'm quietly pleased with myself.

This weekend is a bit of a slow one. We went out for a wonderful lunch with some friends at the other end of town yesterday, then for a short walk down towards the river.

Today, the plan was to do some decorating this afternoon, but I'm not sure if that's going to happen now... see how the afternoon goes

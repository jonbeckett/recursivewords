We went to the cinema last night to see "Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban". In my opinion it's the best HP movie yet, and most importantly actually had a decent story this time. I guess the general concensus is that the third book is the best so that kind of makes sense.

It was interesting to see the three principal characters coming of age; it looks like they are all going to make the crossover to adult acting very easily. You can see Daniel Radcliffe being another Hugh Grant when he's older, and Emma Watson is probably going to have the world at her feet if she gets much better...

When we got back from the cinema we found a message on the answerphone that W's nan had died at lunchtime. To be honest we were expecting the call.

We've finally arrived home after several days of mayhem.

If you've wondered why I've not posted an entry for a few days, it's been down to two things - we have my nephew stay for a couple of days over the weekend, then travelled up to Newcastle Upon Tyne for W's gran's funeral (she died the week before last). I was in two minds if to go due to work commitments, but then W's great aunt died last week too (her gran's sister) so it really wasn't a decision to make any more.

The trip to Newcastle was a pretty sombre one. Although we all tried to make light of the day before (we travelled up with W's parents), the reason for travelling across the country was always there at the back of our minds.

Everything seemed to go very smoothly for the funeral itself. I didn't anticipate it really getting to me too much due to not really knowing W's gran (she had alzheimers, so didn't really know her own family in the last few years) - but it did due to something the vicar said.

Apparently, during his final visit to her during her last hours, he held her hand and said the Lord's Prayer, and this lady who nobody had really been able to communicate with for the last couple of years started to recite the words along with him, with some conviction. He made the point that for a man of the cloth, it was one of the most humbling moments he had ever experienced.

The wake was held at the surviving sister's house in Jarrow - it was quite an insight into the family and community spirit of the people the british call "Northeners" to see everybody pull together and enjoy each other's company, memories and stories for the afternoon. With four generations of the family present, the house seemed to be full of laughter and warmth.

Anyway... as cold as it sounds to say it, we're home now, and it's back to work tomorrow... I'm not looking forward to it as I'm now a long way behind in my project work, and anticipate a fair number of helpdesk calls to be awaiting my return.

It seems like so long since I wrote an entry in my online diary - hence this short entry I guess.

Nothing has really changed; although I'm working on a cool new project at work this week - a LAMP based website for a car dealership. LAMP = Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP. It's nice to work on because it's something new 

My "little laptop that could" at home has had some minor brain surgery this week - it's memory has been trippled from 64Mb up to the heady heights of 192Mb (Yay!) - it can now run more than one application without having a heart attack.

Ummm... what else? I've been using Yahoo Messenger to chat with friends around the place for the first time in ages over the last few days - which I guess is why I've neglected this blog. It's been great to get back in touch with people.

Today's news is that we're off to see the latest Harry Potter movie at the cinema this evening. I'm desperately hoping it will be better than the last one...

I really must get back into the habit of writing in here.

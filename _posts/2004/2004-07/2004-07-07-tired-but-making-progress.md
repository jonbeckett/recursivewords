I was at work until 18:45 this evening, cycled home through howling wind and driving rain, and have been sat here ever since working on CMS once more. I suppose I stopped for tea (home made steak and kidney pie made by my wonderful wife), but otherwise it's been one long coding stretch from the moment I got in.

To be honest, when you are working on something and you can see progress, you don't mind doing it. CMS is coming together really quickly now - I have all the infrastructure in place to do content versioning and security - it's just a case of writing the page publishing routines to take account of the version control stuff. The content manipulation stuff is already sorted, and looking very polished - even if I do say so myself.

Anyway - enough about computers for the evening!

Plan for the rest of the evening is probably to go make a drink in a minute, then watch TV for a while...

It's funny, but when I'm working on programming like I have been the last few days, it leaves very little news of my own to write about that I think anybody might be interested in. I could tell you all about the intricacies of the page publishing function in CMS, but you would probably start snoring within seconds... the really sad thing is that I've found it really interesting - probably because it's a difficult problem to crack. Some people are into crosswords - I must be into programming or something...

Anyway... enough!

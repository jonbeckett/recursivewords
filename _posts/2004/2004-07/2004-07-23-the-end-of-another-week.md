I know, I know - I haven't been writing much in my blog recently.

This week was mostly taken up with training for and participating in a 5K run at Waddesdon Manor near Aylesbury. I did the run in about 28 minutes, along with several hundred other nutters; I think I need to lose about a stone to make running easier for myself  (a date or ten with the ab machine might be in order).

The only real worry that has come out of the 5K event has been a nagging twinge in my right knee. Following an injury a few years ago, I think I have scar tissue on the tenden underneath my right kneecap (apparently its called the "Patellar Tendon"). Anyway - I might have to find some kind of yoga type exercise to help strengthen it.

Away from running, work has been okay. I've been working on a website for an automotive company most of the week. It's based on the CMS code that I have written in my spare time, and is coming together really well.

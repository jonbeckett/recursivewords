Isn't it strange how you can feel like death after a particularly hard workout, then an hour later you are fine again...

I got up at 7 and went for a run this morning - my final real practice for the run around Waddesdon Manor on Thursday night. I had it in my mind to try and go a bit quicker this morning, but it didn't seem to do me much good. I think perhaps my mistake was going out fast, rather than going out at normal pace and then trying to speed up in the last mile or so.

Although I didn't look at my watch, I think I got to halfway very quickly indeed - and then paid for it big time. It was all I could do running back into town to keep myself from walking - somehow I knuckled down though and ran through the tiredness to get home in one piece. The over-riding thought was that I had to get the miles in - put the hard work in now. Did I mention how bloody-minded I can be? 

I finally got back in a about 27 minutes (probably a bit quicker than that, but I didn't look properly at what time I left). I was a bit disappointed, because if I had kept my early pace I would probably have been back inside 25 minutes. Perhaps on race day that might happen - although I'm not banking on it because we're running in the evening and I know it's going to be hot. I might just jog around and get the race done.

It took me ages to recover this morning too... although I don't seem to have the aches and pains I usually have. It must have just been the extra exertion of going that bit faster that knocked the stuffing out of me.

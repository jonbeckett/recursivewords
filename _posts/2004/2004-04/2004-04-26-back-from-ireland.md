Following a 15 hour journey home, we are back from our holiday in Ireland, and I'm back at work slogging away on the project I've been working on for the last few months.

For the past week we have escaped the world by holing ourselves up in a little cottage near Caherdaniel in County Kerry. Each day basically consisted of getting up, going for a walk along the Kerry way to visit various places (which in reality meant various hill forts or ruined abbeys), then getting back in the late afternoon to read a book, then going out for a meal and a drink in the evening either at Caherdaniel, Sneem, Waterville, or some other village nearby.

One day while out walking we came across a goat that had tangled itself up in it's own chain - so much so that the sun was burning down on it, and it could do nothing but lay there... being the brave/stupid person that I am, I took it upon myself to untangle the goat from it's plight (amazingly successfully as it happens). From this point forwards perhaps I should be known as "St. Jonathan, saviour of Goats".

While in Ireland I also discovered that I like Guinness. For those who have no idea, Guinness is an alcoholic "stout" type beverage sold pretty much everywhere in Ireland - only the product sold in Ireland is not the same as you can buy in the rest of the world - in the words of "Freddie" from the bar in Caherdaniel, "It's the real thing".

It will probably amaze a lot of you to learn that I managed to spend a week without going near a computer or the internet. I will admit to taking my Palm organiser, if only for the chess game on it. W also played games on it during the "FastCat" crossing over the Irish sea on Saturday to take her mind off feeling sea sick.

So... here I am, spending my lunchbreak at work typing this crap into the blog. For what it's worth, I didn't receive any particularly stupid or naughty pictures from readers of the blog, but at least I know that one or two of you do read this rubbish

This weekend I are reportin' from deepest darkest Cornwall (the south westerly tip of England for those who only really know England as that little island that used to run the world).

My parents live between Looe and Polperro at a place called Talland, looking out over the sea. It's a five hour trip by car, so we only really visit three or four times a year. We're down for the weekend - I got out of work last night at 5:30, cycled home, W had got everything ready, so we got straight in the car and drove here; we arrived at about quarter past 11 last night.

People who drive for a living must see some amazing things on the road. We see some crazy stuff every time we make this journey - last night it was somebody driving down the dual carriageway in the dark, coming on and off their brakes, and flicking between normal and full beam headlights... it was kind off like they had rigged up a disco lighting system to the car. I was laughing so much I forgot where we were 

It's now 7:35 on Saturday morning - I woke up early because one of Mum and Dad's dogs was barking to go out (they have two Newfoundlands). I got up at 7, and didn't think it would be worth going back to bed. It's getting near to daylight outside now, and the birds are starting to sing.

So - what plans do we have for the weekend? I think today is going to be filled with a trip to Looe, and maybe Fowey (just down the coast a bit - taking the ferry from Bodinnick).

I feel the second cup of tea of the day coming on...

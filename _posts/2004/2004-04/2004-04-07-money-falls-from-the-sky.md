Those that read this blog regularly will know that once upon a time I used to run a writing website called ThoughtCafe, and that it closed down at the end of March. (ThoughtCafe was a website for writers where they could post their writings and others could comment - for feedback and such like).

Just before ThoughtCafe closed I made the source code available for download, and offered my paid services to help install and configure the site for others to raise the old site from the ashes... almost Phoenix like 

The amazing thing is that several parties have come forward and paid up-front for my time to help them get the code up and running. Although I now have a lot of work ahead of me, it feels like money is falling from the sky.

Of course the problem I have now is managing the various versions of the code that are inevitably going to fork away from the original as each client asks for individual changes - so suddenly I have a data and source code control exercise to solve. There's always a catch to any "fun" project, isn't there...

Oh - by the way - I've started putting together a new website too - www.madaboutchess.com. At the moment there's not much more than a few forums and a "version" of this blog code for an events diary, but it's getting there. Go check it out!

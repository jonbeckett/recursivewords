I have just lost two games of chess in a row on FICS (the free internet chess server). I played like a complete idiot. My skills are definitely not "impressive" as Darth Vader would not say.

Today work is okay - I'm making steady progress on the stuff I am working on, and seem to be able to solve most things. The big problem with the project I'm working on is the size of it; if you stand back to take in the bigger picture it scares you a bit.

I heard today at work that one of the major investors in the SCO group has asked for their money back... and SCO's share price took a dive as a result - good on them. If you have no idea what I'm talking about, SCO claims to own the rights to Unix - and claim that while IBM were helping contribute to the development of Linux, they incorporated code that SCO own the copyright to... basically SCO are claiming that everybody owes them a load of money. Yeah, right. They can't even prove without reasonable doubt that they own the rights to Unix, let alone that they have the right to charge Linux users... idiots (this is just my personal opinion, should a SCO employee see this and try and take me to court for anything them dream up).

It comes as no surprise that SCO are being covertly funded by Microsoft either. Linux is the worst thing to ever happen to Microsoft, and will probably cause them to lose their monopoly in the long run. Not bad for a little scandinavian Penguin 

So what else am I thinking about at the moment? I had a text message on my phone from an old friend last night, and realised how boring it is at work without her there. She was the only "non techie", and I got on with her really well. You notice during those bored moments how much you miss having a friend that's "out of the loop" of your own work - somebody you can talk to about anything, or go for a walk at lunchtime with and not talk about work. It was also entertaining to speculate how many of my colleagues thought there was something going on between us - little did they realise she liked girls more than she liked boys

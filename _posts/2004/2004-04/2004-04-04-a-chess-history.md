I just put an introductory message on the Orkut (www.orkut.com) Chess community - I thought it might be interesting for those that read this blog too, so here it is;

My Chess History in a Nutshell

I don't really remember when I learned to play chess, but I can remember playing against members of my family when I would have been about 8 or 9 years old.

I don't recall ever beating anybody until I was about 21 years old, so it's amazing that I continued playing; although I probably only played once or twice a year through my teens.

The chess playing bug finally hit while I was off work with a broken shoulder when I was 21 - out of complete and utter boredom I sat down with a chess set handed down from my Grandfather, and played against a "Saitek Chess Shadow" computer that I had bought on a whim the year before... and I started winning. (Unwittingly, I also learned many lines of the Ruy Lopez)

Through the early 90s I found myself playing against an old school friend quite regularly, and then with the dawning of the internet I became a member (make that "lurker") on the Compuserve Chess Forum.

Around this same time I remember making a pilgrimage to the London Chess Centre (I had never been to a real chess shop before) and walked out with a boxed copy of Fritz 3 which had just been released. Myself and my friend were in awe of it's ability to crush us; even when using take-back...

I also once visited the local chess club and played a couple of casual games against some guy that walked in. He wiped me off the board in the first game, then I scared the life out of him in the second game (although I eventually lost) - it turned out he played in the 4NCL. They tried to sign me up that night but I never went back.

In recent years I have discovered FICS and ICC - on FICS I have the most appalling record ever - I am truly rubbish at shorter time controls.

These days you will most often find me playing in tournaments on www.chessworld.net, where I have discovered I am not too bad at this damn game... you can find me as "jonbeckett73"

So - there you go. My chess history in a Nutshell. That should be an O'Reilly book, shouldn't it

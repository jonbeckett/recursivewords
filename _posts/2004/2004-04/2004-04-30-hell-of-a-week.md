Story of the Week It's been a hell of a week - I am finally pulling together all the disparate strings of the project I have been working on for the last several months, and knitting the various chunks of it into a workable whole.

To give you some idea, there's about a meg of straight ASP code. That's a lot. A million characters worth of programming, and it's not straightforward code either - it's talking between a user interface, workflow system and several corporate accounts systems. It's also drawing it's own user interface on top of all that crap.

Am I looking forward to the weekend...

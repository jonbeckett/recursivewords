It's the Tuesday after easter and I am back at work (sat here with a cup of coffee as I write this - probably my last coffee for a while, because I think it might have been giving me headaches).

This weekend we worked on the garden - digging W a pond. On Friday I took the surface off the pond area, and then on Saturday my brother in law N came over and we dug a pretty big hole in the garden 

Yesterday my mother and father in law came over to visit - W went for a "training walk" with her mum (she's taking part in the "Moonwalk" charity marathon walk through London in aid of Cancer Research in May) - so spent the day with my father in law. It was a pretty good way to spend a bank holiday actually - a visit to the garden centre to get some plants for the pond, and then a lazy wander into town and a few drinks 

Last night (after walking up and down Marlow high street twice looking at menus in Restaurant windows), we went to Franchescos for something to eat. I had a "Mama Serafina" pizza; it always amuses me when I think of them because of one of my work mates ordering one in there one evening, and forgetting what he ordered - he said to the waitress "I think it had the word "mama" in it... I guess you had to be there.

So - I'm back at work and working on the same project I've been plugging away at for the last few months. My golly is it not fun.

I guess I'll write some more later.

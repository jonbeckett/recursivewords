This evening I have been performing the necessary evil tasks that most people should probably do when they get a new computer...

I have recorded a full set of recovery CDs - in order to get the computer back up and running should I ever need to, and installed backup software - I now have a full backup of all our data files on CD.

Something else I discovered while I was waiting for the discs to burn was "PEBuilder" - a freeware tool that lets you construct Microsoft Windows XP Boot Disks. It works absolutely brilliantly, and has plugins for things like McAfee VirusScan and Stinger - a perfect tool to recover a PC that has been infected with some of the nastier viruses doing the rounds at the moment.

Anyway - the last couple of days have been pretty slow. Sometimes I just can't get my head into gear. I wouldn't call it apathy or procrastination - just a lack of motivation.

This evening while waiting for the discs to burn I started reading the "Jonathan Strange" book - so far it seems wonderfully written, so it should be an easy read! (it needs to be - it's over 700 pages of small print)

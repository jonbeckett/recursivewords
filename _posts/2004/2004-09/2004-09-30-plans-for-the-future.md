I'm caught in two minds this evening. Having finished building the PluggedOut Penpals website, I am very tempted to do a full-on profile/networking/blogging/forums site - or expand the penpals site to do it all; except of course I have run a site like that before, and come across all kinds of problems with people arguing.

It's a classic case of knowing I could, but wondering if I should. Just because I have the skills to build any website I want, doesn't necessarily mean I should go and do it. Besides - there are lots of networking sites in existence already - things like Friendster, Orkut and the monster that is Yahoo (although I'm getting pretty annoyed with Yahoo since they updated Messenger and turned a really cool program into a regional hack that offers all kinds of telephony crap you don't actually want at all.... when will they learn 

I guess I should really knuckle down anyway and get the CMS codebase sorted out. There are lots of potential projects coming up that could use CMS, so I really need it to be ship-shape for them

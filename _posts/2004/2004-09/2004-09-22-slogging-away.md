Some days it feels like you are slogging away and not really getting anywhere.

Yesterday at work I had a big of a nightmare with various support calls coming in, and the first results of testing with the workflow project I installed last week at a major customer's site (I'm administering the fixes remotely via a VPN connection). I finally left work at 6pm - picked up by W - and we went straight to my in-laws to finish setting up their computer for them.

I can't remember if I wrote in my diary about it, but they bought a computer with very little memory. The memory arrived yesterday, so I went over to "finish" the installation job. After much fiddling around - and discovering that newer BIOS settings allow you to choose the boot device rather than having to use the jumpers on the hard drives, we got the machine up and running, and it appears to go like a scalded cat 

We finally got home at about half 11 last night, had a drink, then went to bed... this morning we were back up at 7:30, and back out of the house as early as possible - we're finishing early today to go to the "Royal Albert Hall" in London to see the "Lord of the Rings" symphony... I'll report later what it was like 

Anyway... work beckons!

Hi to anybody who reads this babble.

In between working on all kinds of projects in the daytime, and trying to have some semblence of a life in the evenings, I have started making a new website 

The "working" copy of the site is at www.pluggedout.com/penpals - you are free to go and have a look at it, but beware - it's very much a building site at the moment. Over this weekend I am hoping to get some time to build goodies into it and smarten it up (there is no look and feel in it yet).

Among the kinds of things I want to have in it are; - Good search facilities to find penpals - Private messaging centre (so you don't have to use email) - EMail notification of messages sent to you

It already has the ability to sign up, enable your account via an email, and upload a photo to your profile.

Anyway - better get on with some work I suppose.

While looking around on the net for anywhere I can get records of Sissel from (she's this amazing singer - you will have heard her voice without realising it - Titanic, Lord of the Rings etc...), I came across her official website on the internet and spent all of 30 seconds emailing with our appreciation of the concert we went to see at the Royal Albert Hall a week or so ago (actually, I haven't mentioned that yet either, have I - we went to see the Lord of the Rings Symphony at the Royal Albert Hall, conducted by Howard Shore and starring Sissel for the lead vocals).

Anyway - after emailing Sissel's website her PA came back letting me know that she would pass the comments on. I then went into cheeky mode and asked if there was any chance of a signed photo - and they immediately said yes 

Is that cool or what?

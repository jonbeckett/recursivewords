I'm back in the office this morning after several days spent at home suffering and/or recuperating from a pretty nasty virus. It was kind of everything associated with a cold without the snotty nose.

So far, today has been a continual round of catching up with email, getting up to speed with other developers on things that have been written/talked about while I was away, and generally getting back into the swing of things.

This morning I had to tackle shaving... I hadn't had a shave since friday, so this was probably the closest to a beard I have ever been  - it made me look about five years older, and then hacking it off this morning with a brand new razor made me look about 5 years old  Christ it takes a long time to shave when you've let it grow that far. It had to be done though to avoid looking (a) like a stereotypical geek who doesn't care at all about his appearance, or (b) like a caveman. I haven't had a wet shave in a few weeks (usually use an electric one), so I'll probably have spots tomorrow too.

(and if anybody is wondering, there is no comparison between wet shaving and using an electric shaver - wet shaving is a million percent better).

How on earth did I end up writing two paragraphs about something so mundane?

So - it's 12:16 and I'm waiting for the sandwich man to arrive at the office. Some of the guys up here somehow sense his imminent arrival and make their way to the stair well. It reminds me of those stories about "dogs who know when their owner is coming home".

One of the guys up here sings that stupid song from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory "The Candyman Can", except his verion is "The Sandwich Man Can"... and it's one of those songs that once you just hear that one line, it sticks in your head for bloody ages.

Oh well... suppose I had better take my turn at making a round of drinks.

After an uneventful journey home on the trains (which, miraculously connected as designed), I am home once more and sat in front of a bloody computer yet again...

Can you believe how many hours I spend if front of these things?

I just had a couple of "casual" games of chess on the internet. I say casual because I have learned my lesson - I now logon and have a couple of "un-rated" games to see what kind of form I might be in - if I do badly, I don't play any rated games. If I do well, I might play a rated game. This has all been caused by me getting this freebie chess program with a movie called "Game Over"... The software is called Fritz, by a company called Chessbase. They have an internet service where you get a free account and can play other people around the world - generally there seem to be about 2000 people logged on - all playing each other. The addictive bit is that you have a rating - and your various wins and losses against other players affect that rating.

I know, I know... I'm becoming more sad by the day. I guess the reason I like chess so much is because (when you play well) it makes you feel clever - and normally I don't feel very clever at all. I am probably the least clever person I know actually - I have to work very hard to do most things, and have a memory like a bucket with a hole in it (apart from remembering usernames and passwords for some strange reason).

It's too quiet in here... I need to find some music.

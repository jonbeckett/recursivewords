Today has been a good day.

After the crappy start to the day (and likely crappy end to the day - I still have to find my way home from a rainy west London), the tasks required on-site have all gone well. From a development point of view, I have been very much "on form" today. Some days when you're surrounded by programming and problems you are just "on it", and nothing seems to complex. Other days, you just can't get started 

So - the CMS system that the client has installed on the back end of their website now has the file management/browsing functionality that I have been working on at home. It seems to work pretty flawlessly, and I'm actually quite proud of it. There are some rough edges that need ironing out, and some security issues - I guess the more I use it, the more problems I might encounter. The major problem at the moment is that it doesn't validate folder names or windows file names - so you could potentially break it with screwy filenames.

Anyway. Enough geeky thoughts.

It's raining outside. I'm sat in the "Group Accountant"'s office (probably the best office in the building) with the automatic climate control set to 25 degrees C. When I first got here this morning I was froze until about 10:30am when I spotted the remote control for the climate system... and with sounds not unlike a miniature wind tunnel (not that I know what that sounds like), the heater huffed into life and the office is not toasty...

I guess I should think about calling somebody in a minute and let them know I have finished for the day.

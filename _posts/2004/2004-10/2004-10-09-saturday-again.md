It's finally the weekend and I feel better than I have done in quite a while - although still not really well enough to get out running (I think if I did try and run any distance I'd end up coughing my lungs up).

I still can't believe we are racing towards the middle of October... the first christmas adverts (that I've noticed) appeared on the television last night. How mad is that? Speaking to my sister-in-law on the telephone this morning, they are taking their son to the toyshop this morning to figure out what he might like to ask Father Christmas for 

My bet is that my little nephew is going to go straight to the Playstation 2 department in the store - he got one for christmas last year and has become a complete and utter computer game nut. It's actually quite scary - how quick he picks up games... he still won't beat me on any of the racing car games though  I am the master.

For the last few months (when I get the chance or feel in the mood) I have been playing Formula One 2004 on the PS2. It's probably the longest a game has lasted in my hands; usually I figure out how the game works (and therefore how to win) and never play it again... this F1 game has a career mode though, so you get the chance to work your way up the ranks. I expect once I win the world championship though, that will be the end of it... I tend to sell games I don't play on e-bay.

What I would really like is a GameCube - it seems to have the most original and fun games. I might even get hold of an X-Box at some point too - there are a couple of games coming out on it that look like fun. The PS2 has a network game coming out called "Ratchet and Clank : Up Your Arsenal" that looks like it will be rather brilliant - but I am old enough and cycnical enough to want to see customer reviews of it before I shell out any money.

p.s. I'm listening to Jean Michel Jarre's new "Aero" album this morning, and it's fab. I can't wait for the new Duran Duran album to come out either...

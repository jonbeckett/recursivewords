It's Monday morning, and I've gone the whole weekend without posting to my blog (yet again).

This weekend we had so much planned, and in the end none of it happened because my brother and his family called over. Well - I say we had so much planned, but in reality all we were thinking about doing was taking a computer over to a work colleague's house (i.e. get rid of it), and go and sort out a hundred and one things around the house. Washing, ironing, that kind of thing.

On Sunday I had a bit of an impulse purchase - "TOCA Touring Car Driver 2" for the Playstation 2. We spent quite a bit of time in the afternoon playing with it - managing to smash various cars to pieces  If anybody has looked at it, it's perhaps not quite as polished as the Gran Turismo series, but is a lot more fun to play. My little nephew's preferred mode of play was to start a race and hit the other cars at the first corner as hard as possible - usually resulting in bits of bodywork and wheels going everywhere, accompanied by the most evil laugh a 7 year old can come out with.

Anyway... better get on with some work I suppose.

Greetings from a dark, rainy England.

This evening I am working on the CMS scripts once more (go see http://www.pluggedout.com/index.php?pk=dev_cms for more information). Goal for this evening are to get the various last few bits and pieces of unfinished coding sorted out so I can move on and do some of the more exciting new stuff - like the "repository" 

Following some discussions with the guys at work, I have decided to effectively build a file repository into the CMS project... well - actually, it will be a seperate project that will dovetail nicely with CMS.

It's going to be great  I'll post again later with progress.

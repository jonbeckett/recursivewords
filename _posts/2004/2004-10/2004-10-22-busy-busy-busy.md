It's the end of another week and I don't appear to have written anything in my blog for several days... I guess that gives an indication to how hectic the last few days have been.

Work has been as mad as usual - although I think I'm actually getting used to drowning. I'm working on three projects at the same time at the moment - but of course nobody can really do that, so I'm working on one while the others become more late.

Away from work, myself and W went to Birmingham on Thursday evening to visit the fertility clinic where our IVF is being done. For the next few weeks I have to inject W each day with a drug that slowly knocks out her own hormones - then we go back for me to learn how to administer a cocktail of drugs that will kick her body back into action. I had never injected anybody or anything before, so it was something of a learning experience for me - so far I'm coping fine though (so is W amazingly!).

For some reason I had real trouble getting out of bed this morning. Actually, I've had real trouble getting out of bed for the last few weeks (that doesn't mean I took several weeks to get out of bed - rather that each morning for the last few weeks I have had trouble waking up... just thought I'd clear that one up).

Yesterday evening we had the most healthy dinner ever - boiled potatoes, greens, and quiche. We then followed that up by me going to the garage and buying Marmite flavoured crisps and two tubs of Ben and Jerry's "Chocolate Brownie" ice cream  I sat and ate my tub in one sitting... and then felt sick. My own fault. I know. I'm guessing somebody will tell me how stupid it was to bother making something healthy and then eat a whole tub of ice cream.

W has been busy beavering away on her family tree website - if you are interested you can see it at http://www.pluggedout.com/familytree. She's been working on it for a while now, and the effort really shows - it's a nice site. If you are interested in doing any genealogy research, feel free to get in touch with her.

Hey - I almost forgot to mention - I brought a chess board into work yesterday - with the intention of playing all comers at lunchtimes. So far I am undefeated in the office, but I can't see that record surviving for much longer. One day I'm going to make a huge mistake and the winning streak will be broken. It has to be said that the guy I usually play against has come on leaps and bounds - yesterdays game all hinged on one mistake he made early on that lost him a rook for a knight, and a couple of pawns.

Aha... a cup of tea just arrived at my desk. Guess I should do some more work

It would appear that I am actually getting better today... thank god!

I have been off work for the last couple of days with a pretty bad cold, and finally this afternoon I have started to feel quite a bit better. It's weird - last Friday I started to go down with it, but thought I had got away with it - then I woke up on Saturday and felt dreadful.

Ho hum.

I sometimes wonder how many people read this blog... and I wonder where they are in the world. My life can't be the most exciting one in the world to read about, can it.

I guess something exciting did happen this week though - we went to Midland Fertility Services to kick off the IVF treatment we are going to go through to start having children. (we found out earlier this year that I have a sperm defect that means the chances of us having children normally are dramatically reduced). It feels kind of strange knowing that we are about to start out on a road that in all likelihood is going to carry us through the next 25 years or so 

What else have I been up to? To be honest, I haven't done much at all over the last few days; this virus really has knocked me out. I wish I had something more interesting to write.

I guess if anything while I have been at home, I have been looking around on the internet now and again to see if there is anything I can take part in. It probably sounds strange, but I usually end up building and running websites; and consequently never end up taking part in them. It would be nice for a change to find some sort of community website that I can take an active part in...

Changing subject violently, I got told off for trying to do work while off ill this morning. The HR manager called me and said "Did I hear correctly that you dialed in via VPN to help out with (censored) help call? - I had to admit that yes, I had been trying to help out... unsucessfully as it happened - I VPN'd to my desktop machine at the office, then tried to VPN from that to the client's offices... of course when my machine at work connected to their network it vanished off the office network (that's how networking works) - and of course because the office network couldn't see it, I lost touch with it too... and spent 10 minutes going round in circles before I realised what had happened. Stupid.

In the process of trying every angle to connect to the client site, I downloaded a hacked copy of PC Anywhere off the internet... except it was in german so all the dialogues were unintelligible... serves me right really.

So there you go - my boredom inducing ramblings for today. I might write later if anything of note happens...

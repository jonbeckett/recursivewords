I'm kind of lost this evening... I keep starting things and then deciding to do something else instead. I wonder why?

Late this afternoon at work we were stress testing a system that's under development, and had to fill in a load of "request" forms with whatever data we liked. I think I won the prize for the most original data - I variously filled the request forms out from George Bush Jr, Luke Skywalker, and even God Almighty. Bush was requesting an "iddy biddy laptop with the internets in it", and further expounded that "it's kinda magic, aint it, like click click click naked chicks. It's real easy..." - this induced snorts of laughter from the guys sorting through the requests.

God Almighty requested proof of it/his/her own's existence - and halfway through qualifying the request dissappeared in a puff of logic, hitchhikers style (you need to read the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy to get that one).

It's funny, whenever I start thinking about George Bush Jr, I get this scene of him stood in the middle of NORAD, looking up at all the huge video screens, and saying "can I have a go?"

So there you go - that's how very important my work was this afternoon - improvising idiotic entries for a corporate intranet/workflow system.

Yay... I'm listening to internet radio stations on WinAmp and Peter Gabriel just came on.

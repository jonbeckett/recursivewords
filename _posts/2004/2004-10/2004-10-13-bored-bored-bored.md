I'm in one of those states of mind today where you cannot concentrate on anything too deep. Nothing has really "grabbed" me yet.

When I woke up this morning I had distinct problems getting out of bed. Why is it that you sometimes sleep so deeply, and then have difficulty waking up? I know in England we have an old saying - "the sleep of the just" - I guess that was me last night. I fell asleep before W came up to bed, but apparently woke up and had a conversation with her when she did come up... I have no recollection of that at all.

I find it slightly scary that I can have full blown conversations with people when I am really asleep. Apparently if I start snoring W just tells me, and I apologise and roll over. It makes you wonder just how much of your brain is still switched on when the rest of you is obviously not there 

Okay. In a further attempt to waste some time until any motivation returns, I shall describe the contents of my desk. Yes. I am this bored.

(Working from left to right)

Helpdesk mousemat with an empty glass on top of it - one of those glasses with the octagonal fluting like you used to see in infant school. Next is a couple of puzzle toys; a cage with a spikey thing that you're supposed to be able to get out without breaking it (although I did break in one day while trying to show somebody how to do it). Other toy is like a rubix cube but with all axis rotated 45 degrees; meaning it's so damn difficult to figure out how to even rotate the thing that you just want to stamp on it.

Behind the puzzles is Buzz Lightyear. He protects me desk from the evil Zurg empire while I'm not here. He's leaning on a desk tidy that has a photo of W propped in it, a 12C/3 ruler, some euro coins, an eraser, and a bulldog clip. The pens have long since escaped and gone to wherever the hell the rest of the pens in this world go. Perhaps Buzz helps them escape to their spaceships in the night.

Next up is my monitor - a big old 19C/3 monitor with scratches in the glass. Underneath the monitor is part of an old laptop docking station that provides me with a mini shelf to stash paperwork under. I have no idea what's under there any more; probably the solution to unified field theory or something.

Next up is a red in-tray, which is filled with junk. Three books AB lent to me that I havent' read yet - "Neuromancer", "Count Zero" and "Mona Lisa Overdrive", all by William Gibson (who I discovered is the name behind the "Gibson" computers in the movie "Hackers"). I also have a pair of Sennheiser headphones, a wedding gift list for another colleague, and a stapler.

Finally, there is an O'Reilly SQL book, and to upright paper tidy things that are filled with all manner of junk... oh - and my telephone, which has a hundred buttons - four or five of which I know how to use.

So there you go. My little environment. I shall now sit here and much on the various stuff I brought for lunch today.

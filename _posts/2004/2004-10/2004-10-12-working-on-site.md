This morning finds me in the offices of a client in west London, working on some bespoke changes to their website.

Visiting this client is usually a bit of a bind - spending the day here usually means leaving the house at 7am, catch a succession of trains, and then finally a taxi to the offices. They are an easy going bunch though, so if the various train and taxi connections "work", the day makes a refreshing change.

Sometimes however, the day goes remarkably badly. Perhaps badly is the wrong word. You know some days you seem to be swimming against the tide all day? Today looks like being one of those days.

The trains were fine. I just had a 25 minute wait for a taxi. I arrive on site and find myself sitting in a vacant office installing the tools I need to do my work on some machine they found out of nowhere. Granted, the machine I'm using is a 1.7Ghz Pentium 4, with a nice flat screen, but having to install a ton of stuff before I can start is a bit annoying. At least I get to set the machine up exactly how I like it before I start 

So here I am. I'll post more later on progress and boredom.

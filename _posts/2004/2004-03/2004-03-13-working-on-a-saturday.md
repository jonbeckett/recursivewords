It's 9:37 on a Saturday morning as I start writing this, and I am in the office at work. In return for having the day to go filming at GMTV, I am working through Saturday. Bang went this weekend...

Last night my other half picked me up from work and we went straight to Didcot and out for a meal to celebrate my brother in law's birthday. I think a pretty good time was had by all, and I ended up drinking more than I normally do (I am rapidly turning into a lightweight - any more than two pints these days and I know I've drunk them).

We finally got in at about 11 and went straight to bed... then of course I was back up this morning and on my way here.

What a crap way to spend your saturday. I guess I better get on with something at least.

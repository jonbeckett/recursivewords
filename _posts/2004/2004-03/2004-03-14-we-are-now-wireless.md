After a bit of a spending spree today in PC World, our house now has wireless networkingis the speed of the thing. Event printing full page graphics, it still kicks off within a second or two and throws the page out.

Anyway - that's all for now... have to go and get some clothes ready for the morning (we are off to the GMTV studios in the morning to do the thing with Lorraine Kelly).

After all this I'm going to have the nightmare of a week working on the workflow stuff I've been thrashing away with at work - probably the biggest single handed development I've had to do since I worked at ABS five or six years ago - but at least then I didn't have steep deadlines to meet...

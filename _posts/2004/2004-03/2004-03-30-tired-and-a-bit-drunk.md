Well, I'm not really drunk, but I'm not really sober either. Since getting in from work this evening all I've really done is mess around on the internet, play with the new chess program I've got (ChessPartner), and drink beer...

I did watch Eastenders while eating tea, but otherwise I've been sat here in the front room (where all the games consoles reside), listening to radio 4, and piddling around on the internet on this old steam powered laptop.

For all those people out there using Pentium 68's with 60 million jigawatsits of RAM, this website was designed, built and populated by an old Toshiba laptop running Windows 98. It's less than a 20th as powerful as the latest machines you can buy, but it runs everything I want - a decent browser, a virus killer, a text editor, and all the chess programs I could ever want.

The only thing keeping me running Windows on this old laptop is that I have a D-Link PCMCIA card to do the wireless internet connection (our house is a hot spot  - if I could find a driver for it for Linux, I would be booting into the Slackware installation that also resides on this crap old machine.

I've drunk two bottles of Rebellion beer, and it's making it difficult to keep my eyes open. I guess it is 11:30pm though, so I'll go to bed...

I thought it was about time that I wrote a blog entry for March... I could end up changing the way Blog works to show the last N entries rather than "this month"... hmmm - perhaps I'll do it in a few minutes.

Anyway - what have I been up to?

It is my proud duty to announce to whoever reads this blog (probably nobody) that I have completed the first commercial implementation of the CMS scripts - for those that have no idea what I'm talking about, go visit Lightfoot Solutions website and have a look - I designed and built the entire thing for the client. The website uses my CMS scripts to allow the client to change the content of the site whenever they like - they don't have to come back to me to do it.

Other than that, myself and my other half are going to be on TV next monday! We're going to be on GMTV in the morning - they are doing a segment about fertility for a few days, and we're going to be the first day - talking about the issues of people starting out with having a family. It's kind of bizarre to think we're going to be on TV, but there you go...

At work things are more mental than ever. We really desperately need to hire some new developers now... the company I work for in the daytime is winning projects left, right and centre - quite how we are going to manage to complete all the work is anybodies guess.

Right... I'm off to fiddle with the Blog code.

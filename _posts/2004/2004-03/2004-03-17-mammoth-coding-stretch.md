I have just completed a mammoth coding stretch on a project that's having a milestone meeting tomorrow. For those who have no idea what I'm talking about, when you embark on a huge software development project, you agree with the client to have meetings every so often to check progress, details and so on.

The catch is that usually you plan at the start to be "so far along the road" at each milestone - and like anything complex, the amount of work predicted between the milestons varies considerably - some things turn out to be a lot easier than you predicted, whereas others turn out to be far more complex than you predicted.

I have to admit I am absolutely wiped out. I got in at 9 this morning, and have basically sat in silence all day writing code. It's not been fun. While there should be a sense of achievement because some major parts of the project are starting to "hang together", there is only really a sense of relief that I have got to a point where I can walk away without worrying too much.

I guess the point I'm walking around without making is that if you are somebody who worries what other people think of your work, then don't become a software developer... it's a bad mixture.

This morning my wife and I were up at 5am, and were picked up at just gone 6am for the trip to the GMTV studios.

It was kind of strange waiting in the ready room, drinking coffee, and seeing the likes of Eamon Holmes, Fiona Phillips, John Stapleton, and so on popping in and out for coffee and bites to eat.

In the end our segment of the programme went really smoothly and it was really easy sitting on the couch with Lorriane Kelly 

Following the programme we went back and more or less got straight back in the car and straight back to Marlow - back before lunch!

So what are my thoughts of appearing on the television? It was pretty strange - especially seeing these "known faces" walking around - the usual crew you see on breakfast telly... and of course we saw a couple of B list celebs - Helen Worth was in makeup at the same time as me (she plays "Gail" in "Coronation Street"). I guess the overall impression was one of being impressed at how smoothly it all seems to work.

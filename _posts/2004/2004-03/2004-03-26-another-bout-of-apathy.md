I'm sat here at work staring at Textpad (the program I'm writing this in), and the reams of SQL in the window behind it, and listening to some classical music or other on my headphones... around me in the office everybody seems to be over-run with work.

I'm in a strange situation where I have tons to get on with, but have a severe lack of motivation to get on with it. I've felt like this all week - probably the biggest attack of apathy I've ever experienced to be honest. It would maybe be better if I knew why, but I don't - I just feel kind of tired all the time and can't be bothered to get on with anything.

I know where I used to work, the MD almost let me start coming in late, and work late because he knew I functioned best in the evening - I don't really switch on until the middle of the afternoon 

Away from work, this weekend I have my first weekend "off" for absolutely ages. Nothing planned, so I'm hoping to spend this weekend having a proper rest. Like that's really going to happen...

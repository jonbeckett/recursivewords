Okay - before I start, I should perhaps re-iterate that this diary is based on code that I wrote, and I give away as "open source" to whoever wants a copy.

I decided to start the re-write of Blog to become "multiBlog" last night. If you have no idea what I'm on about, I have been planning to do a multi-user version of Blog for ages, and last night something happened that gave me some impetus to do something...

Some guy (I'm mentioning no names) has made a modified version of my diary programming, and is palming it off as his own. It still mentions me in the comments within each file, but he's been rather cheeky in replacing my name everywhere else with his own name.

To say I was annoyed is something of an understatement...

Back in the real world, I am a bit "at sea" at the moment at work. I have a load of changes to make to a project I'm working on, but a lot of those changes need to be cleared by the client before I can really do much. There are things for me to be getting on with, but it's getting a bit difficult to choose what I can work on, and what I cannot.

God I sound boring at the moment.

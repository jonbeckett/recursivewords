What is it about Tuesdays? I seem to write in my blog at some point on a Tuesday these days.

I've kind of decided that I need to spruce up this demonstration Blog, so don't be surprised if you see some graphics appearing around the place, and maybe a new version if I find something it doesn't do easily

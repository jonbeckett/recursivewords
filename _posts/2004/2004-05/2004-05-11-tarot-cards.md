I have a tarot card that came with a Microsoft magazine on my desk today - it's got a drawing of a geek on it, and is called "the developer". You can imagine how it's quietly going down with the more pious people at work (actually, I don't think the real god botherers have seen it yet). No doubt at some point I'll be politely asked to remove it...

Anyway - I started writing this entry with the intention of having a few minutes off from the struggle that is the software I am working on (the same project I've been on for the last three months).

I went for a run last night - the first in a while. I was quite shocked how tired I felt - although that may have been because it was pretty hot yesterday evening. I've decided I'm going to enter the Waddesdon Manor 5k road race in July - which gives me a couple of months to prepare. I should be fine, but I want to make sure i put the work in this time (unlike the Marlow 5 that I ended up pulling out of - it was a decision between having spending money to go on holiday with, or running the race... I wasn't about to be selfish so did some freelance work and made ourselves a few hundred to take on holiday).

Later in the year there are a number of 10k races around the place - I'll see how it goes with running, but if I can get to 10k I will have all sorts of races I can take part in...

This evening I think I have a date with the lawn mower. How exciting.

For some reason I went all the way through yesterday without writing an entry in my blog. At one point I even had it on my screen, but didn't get as far as typing anything.

We spent the past weekend working on the garden once more - after a trip to Booker garden centre, we came home with some plants and about a quarter of a ton of cobbles (that was fun, pushing the cobbles the the garden centre). The cobbles are now laid in the "beach" area of the pond, and are supposed to give a slope so if animals fall in they have an easy way to climb out.

We went to Maidenhead as well at the weekend. I went shopping for a USB cable and came out of the store with the cable, a USB hub, and a little doobry that allows me to plug PS2 controllers into a USB slot  Our laptops at home have now become mobile emulators - last night I downloaded about 30 SNES ROMS and a SNES Emulator (SNES stands for Super Nintendo Entertainment System). It was actually rather strange, playing Super Mario World on a laptop. Oh, and before people start bleeting, I had most of the games when I owner a SNES many years ago.

Yesterday at work I completed the big security overhaul that I was grumbling on about last week. Unfortunately that means today I'm back working on the huge project that I've been plugging away at for about four months now. Aaarrgghh! I guess I'll write again later.

Last night I decided my little laptop at home needed a bit of a cleanup so downloaded "Perfect Disk", which appears to do a much better job than Norton Speed Disk. Unfortunately it spent all night arguing with the virus scanner (which kicked in at about 2am), and still hadn't finished this morning. How stupid are computers...

On another note, it looks like I'm going to be running a 5K road race in July, so need to get out training again - I thought I might run early in the morning, becuase I'm usually wiped out when I get home. Have to see how it goes.

Where on earth does the phrase "chuffed to little mint balls" come from? All I know is I am extremely pleased because the programming I have been working on for the last three months is actually working.

It's been a long hard slog, and it's not over yet because I have to test and bolster the various elements of the code to make it user-proof, but it's getting there now (at last!)

In my spare time over the last few days I have been working on multiBlog - the multiUser blogging engine that I'm hoping is going to conquer the world  I've had loads of commercial interest in it, which augers well for the future. I'll probably give the code away, but sell my services for extending and supporting it. It's going to be fun 

Anyway - time to go home I think! (I'm at the office right now).

p.s. the offer still stands for stupid/funny pictures - I will post them on the Blog if I get any decent ones.

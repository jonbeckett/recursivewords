One of my colleagues is busy organising a popular uprising on our floor of the office. He is threatening to throw the health and safety handbook at the HR department. His chances however of getting anywhere are less than a small cat beating an elephant in a "who can eat the most pies" competition.

The reason for all the fuss is of course that summer has hit the UK at last, and in the spirit of all service industries in the UK, we are totally unprepared to deal with the heat. While the building we work in would be suitable for sub zero temperatures often experienced in the winter months, when we reach summer our building turns into a vast oven.

The health and safety website being perused at the moment reports that one option is to "dress cool". We're not sure if this means we should wear loose and light cothing, or wear bling bling jewellery and MC Hammer trousers... there's some tip about wearing a wet towel on your head - surely that would make us all look like palestineon terrorists?

We're melting! Help!

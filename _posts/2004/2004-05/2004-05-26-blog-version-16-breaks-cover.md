After a long coding session last night, I got the templating system up and running in Blog, and incremented the version number to 1.6.

You can get hold of the download from the blog homepage (http://www.pluggedout.com/index.php?pageid=3).

For some reason I was "on it" last night - the code was easy to write for a change. Some days I find I can do things really easily, and I remember all the loose ends; other days I really struggle and can't see the most obvious of bugs. I guess we're all human.

The incarnation of blog you are looking at here is actually version 1.6, although it has a couple of hacks in it to do the RSS feed - I will be folding that into the original source - probably this lunchtime (i.e. in 5 minutes time).

Have fun, and I'll think of something non-computer related to write later

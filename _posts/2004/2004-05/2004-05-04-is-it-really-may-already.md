Just a quick message to say thanks to all those who have sent me messages on Yahoo, MSN, and so on to let me know they are there and reading this Blog  I have no idea why you do read this, but it's nice to know you are there. If you ever want to send a message for a chat when you're bored, feel free.

Today work has been interrupted somewhat by the virus alerts emminating from Redmond - apparently there is a new worm on the loose that attacks various network protocols. They are recommending that people install firewalls and update WinXP to the latest "critical" patch level. What a pile of pants. So far the patch process has been running for nearly 5 hours on my work machine.

This weekend I spend most of the time working on various web projects (my brother's included), and watching my little nephew play "Ratchet and Clank" on the PS2. A lot of the work I wanted to get done over the weekend didn't happen because the internet connection kept cutting out - I figured out that it was a problem with the ADSL switches at the exchange again (we've had it happen before - if you pick up and put down the phone five or six times you suddenly get the ADSL back).

Other than that, my weekend was pretty boring. We went out for dinner at the Two Brewers in Marlow with W's brother on Sunday night, and that was about it. Somebody message me and brighten my week up!

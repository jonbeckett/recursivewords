If you are online and want to have a very stupid conversation with a very bored person (who has his webcam switched on), give me a shout.

I'm logged into MSN Messenger by the way... (I think you need the latest version if you want to see me). Just page jonbeckett73@hotmail.com.

I just filled out the MSN profile - I guess this means Microsoft finally have the goods on me

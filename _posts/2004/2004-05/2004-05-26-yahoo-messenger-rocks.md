I have just installed the latest version of Yahoo Messenger on my computer at work, and have to say I've not been this impressed with a piece of software in a long time...

It's suddenly apparent that Yahoo have not been sitting on their hands for the last year. The new version of Messenger has all kinds of new toys in it - skins, thumbnail photos of contacts, animated avatars, streaming radio stations, integrated games to play with your friends... the list goes on.

It is seriously cool 

All I need now is for people to message me to try out the new toys on offer - remember, it's jonbeckett73 you need to send a message to! (I'm online all day at work anyway).

Today at work things are decidedly slow. We are running very much on a skeleton staff because lots of staff are either on-site or on holiday. Upstairs it's just me, AB and DW looking after help calls and plugging away on development work... there are a couple of outstanding helpdesk calls, but nothing too serious.

I wonder how many radio stations Yahoo are broadcasting? Just recently I've joined the e-music website and started downloading MP3s from them to play at work. It's only 9 dollars a month, and you get something like 40 tracks for that. Pretty good really. I've already discovered a couple of really great Indie bands that I otherwise wouldn't listen to - "Helicopter Helicopter" and "Sugarcult". Go check out www.emusic.com and see what you think. It's pretty amazing value really - just remember that they tend not to carry the dross from the charts...

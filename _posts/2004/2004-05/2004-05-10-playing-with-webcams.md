I tried installing my old webcam on my laptop last night. To be honest, I forgot I had a webcam until I was rooting around behind the units in the junk room, and there it was on the floor. After much digging around on the internet I figured out which model it was (a Logitech Quickcam Express - the cheapest one they used to do), and downloaded the Win98 drivers for it... all 40Mb of them.

Luckily it would seem that you could select either the ton of crap that Logitech want you to install, or just the drivers, which take cough ten meg to install. Is that bloated or what?

After another half an hour of messing around I had Yahoo Messenger up and running, and the webcam working. It seemed to work fine, so I logged myself into one of the "friendly" chat rooms and waiting to see if anybody looked at the cam... after getting chatted up by about 20 robots, I got pretty fed up with the entire exercise and decided to go and do something else instead. After some cursory checking of user profiles, I did figure out that the robots are the people with the more interesting names - like "hotbabe394789" and "lickme947234C/3... haha

It goes without saying - if you would like to have a webcam conversation with me, just send me a message (evening GMT - so that's middle of the day in the USA), and I'll plug it in. I just want to see if the damn thing really works!

Apart from that, this weekend I did very little. On Saturday I had planned to get some gardening done (our lawn is rapidly turning itself into an amazon rainforest), but rain put paid to that idea. If you've ever tried cutting wet grass, you'll know what I'm talking about.

We had friends over for dinner on saturday night, and didn't get to bed until about 2am - following that we were back up at 7am the next morning to receive W's Mum - she was running in the Marlow 5 running race (which I should have been in, but hadn't trained for a month so pulled out of).

There were something like 1050 people in the Marlow 5 race, a number of which myself and W knew, so we took photos and cheered them off the line and back over the finish. I decided (having seen the form of a couple of friends) that I am going to enter a 5K running race at Waddesdon Manor in July. Should be fun 

Anyway - my lunchtime has drawn to an end so I better get on with some work.

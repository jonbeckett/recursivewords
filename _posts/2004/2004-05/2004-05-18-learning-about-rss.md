Yesterday afternoon my better half W called in where I work to give me my house keys - it turns out I had left them on the side when I left for work. She was going to her reading group, so wasn't going to be in all evening - meaning (I'll get to the point of this eventually...) I was going to be on my own all evening so could do what I wanted!

On the way home from work I called in at the local supermarket and picked up some chips, dips, and a pizza - then I went home, messed around on the internet for a while (mostly answering questions on my development forums, and learning a bit more about RSS news feeds), and watched some insane fighting sport on Eurosport called "K-1".

Somehow while eating Pizza and watching the telly I managed to fall asleep, and woke up with W stood over me cooing "Jonathan, Jonathan..." - apparently she figured out I hadn't been asleep that long because the kettle in the kitchen was still warm from the cup of tea I had made earlier.

What a mundane posting this is.

Today at work I am chugging along writing a utility to change the security profile of several tens of thousands of documents within a document management system from one setting to another - it's not really fun at all.

The one thing of note today is that I have downloaded a piece of software called FeedDeamon (written by the same guy that wrote Alaire HomePage) - it's an application designed to aggregate RSS feeds, and from what I've seen of it so far, it's pretty good.

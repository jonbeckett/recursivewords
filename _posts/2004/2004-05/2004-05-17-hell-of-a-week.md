Late last week I had a milestone meeting for the gargantuan project I have been working on for the last few months (and bleeting about in my blog to try and get at least some sympathy from those that read this). On Tuesday, while racing to pull the software back together for the big meeting on Thursday, I somehow managed to develop the biggest headache in the history of the universe (well... the worst one I had in a while anyway).

I got home on Tuesday night, took a load of Nurofen, and slept for about two hours. During the meeting on Thursday the same thing happened - this headache started banging away - when we stopped for lunch I nearly fainted while walking up towards the Golf club (our offices are on an estate where there is a golf course; we quite often take visitors to the golf club for lunch).

Following that my foot has come off the throttle a bit at work, and I at least have a couple of weeks before the latest round of changes need to be seen again by the client. It's kind of a strange situation to be in - each time you get to the top of one hill and start freewheeling down the other side, you can already see the start of the next hill.

This weekend, W took part in the Playtex moonwalk - a 26 mile midnight walk through the streets of London. She set off with my sister in law at about 7pm on Saturday night - there was some kind of pasta party at Hyde Park in London for those taking part before the real thing kicked off. I got a phone call at about 22:30 letting me know that they were sat with 15000 others watching a live music concert and various celebrities entertaining them while they ate.

The next morning at 5am I got up, woke up my brother and his son, and we made our way into London on the 6:40 train. We eventually arrived at the finish line (after walking the entire length of Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park) just in time to see W and J get to the finish. We took champagne with us and made rather a lot of noise 

Yesterday afternoon W was a bit stiff, but following massages and stretching throughout the evening, she's up and around today and feeling good. She raised about 300 for cancer research...

Anyway - I better get on with my work I guess.

Footnote - I put together the RSS stuff for my blog at last...

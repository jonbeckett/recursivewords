I almost overslept this morning. I  m going to blame the strangest dream I  ve had in quite some time. None of it made any sense, but it stuck in my head all day. Somebody I know was in it - I  ll have to tell them about it. I wonder if they had a strange dream too?

So.

I went to an office today - for the first time in three years. The company I work for is busy putting together a new website (read: I  m putting together the new website), so we needed to get together to talk about pages, wording, and so on. The meeting could have happened remotely, but I think people are starting to get itchy about not having seen one another for so long.

We hired out a meeting room in a building that does exactly that - hires out meeting rooms. For an eye-watering amount of money you get a clean, tidy room in a managed office with wifi, a TV on the wall, a coffee machine, and some stale biscuits.

At least the coffee machine was good.

After revelling in the novelty factor of being   out of the house   for a few hours, we retired to a nearby cafe and met up with another colleague (the same cafe my daughter works at, although she was not there today).

I  m not going to lie - it was good to see co-workers again.

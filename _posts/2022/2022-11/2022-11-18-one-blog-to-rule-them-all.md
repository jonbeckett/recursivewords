Have no illusions. This is all about laziness.

Substack does great email notifications. It also has a simple switch that turns comments off. Oh - and most importantly, it also means I don  t have to think about synchronising github repositories, checking netlify is still doing it  s job, or any of that fun stuff. I can just write.

Yes, I  ll be beholden to a corporate overlord, but given that so many publishing platforms are falling like a house of cards at the moment, it made sense to go somewhere simple. And somewhere that  s not a walled garden.

Anyway. Enough of that. What  s going on with me?

Work is keeping on keeping on - and no, I  m not going to write anything about it because I don  t write about work. Never have. Never will. Suffice to say it  s busy, and looks like continuing to be pretty busy for the next however long. Which is good?

Home is busy too - mostly driven by my own idiotic endeavours, and by the rest of the family. The Youtube channel seems to have taken on a life entirely of it  s own - and is rolling down the hill, gathering speed in the same way an avalanche might - despite any efforts to put the brakes on it.

While this is happening, my other half started painting kitchen cupboards a few weeks ago, but didn  t get very far - so we now have half the kitchen cupboards missing. I can see myself getting involved in that too just to get it done. No doubt I  ll do it wrong somehow.

The washing machine is on it  s third load today already - and it  s still only lunchtime. That  s all I  m going to write about that.

Finally   I  m escaping in a bit to go have lunch at the cafe where my daughter works. She was called in this morning on her day off after several staff went off sick. I tried to impress on her that this is a good thing - that being seen as solid and reliable is a huge step with a new job. I  ll walk back with her at the end of her shift.

My recent posts have often seemed like I  m shouting while passing by doing something else - and it  s pretty much true. They  re invariably written in a ten minute window between doing other things.

Finally - and can you BELIEVE what  s going on at Twitter? This morning Elon shut their offices until Monday. What on earth is going on? There are rumours that 75% of the staff have walked out. The exodus to Mastodon has gathered pace enormously over the last few days   you can find me there at <https://mastodon.online/@jonbeckett>.

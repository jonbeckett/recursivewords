That  s it. I  ve had it with drinking. Or at least, I  ve had it with alcohol - until I forget how rubbish I  ve become at dealing with it. While watching the   Rings of Power   on TV last night I had a couple of glasses of wine. You would have thought this morning that I  d headbutted a brick wall all night.

Zaphod Beeblebrox comes to mind - and his description of the fabled   Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster   - widely regarded as the best drink in the universe, and which feels like having your brains smashed in by a slice of lemon wrapped round a large gold brick.

Seriously though - how can I get away with a glass of wine or two one day, and then abjectly fail the next? I guess, thinking about it, it  s been several weeks since I last had any sort of alcoholic drink. Perhaps your body gets   out of practice  ? That  s a good think though, right? Perhaps my liver saw it coming and said   here, brain - you deal with it  .

At least it  s a quiet work day. They have been few and far between this year.

Of course mentioning that work is quiet is a little like mentioning Beetlejuice. If you say it three times, there  s no telling what might happen. On that subject, did you know about the Beetlejuice easter egg in Community (the quite wonderful TV show)? His name is mentioned once in each of the first three seasons - moments after the third mention, he appears in the background. Go look it up on Youtube.

And no, I  m not going to mention his name for a third time - that  s just tempting fate.

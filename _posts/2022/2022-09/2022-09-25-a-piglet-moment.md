There's a moment in the book "The House at Pooh Corner" that has always stayed with me:

> Piglet sidled up to Pooh from behind.  

> "Pooh!" he whispered.  

> "Yes, Piglet?"  

> "Nothing," said Piglet, taking Pooh's paw. "I just wanted to be sure of you."

> The House at Pooh Corner, by A. A. Milne

I had one of those moments last night, and messaged a friend I've not spoken to for quite some time. This is where those that know me will start to shake their head, and smile at the contrariness of it all. I could swear the universe was up to something.

For the last several days - in the quietest moments - it was almost like a whisper on the wind. A calling to reach out. I don't understand it, and don't particularly want to pick it to pieces too much. Sometimes it doesn't do to reach behind the curtain - sometimes it's better to just admire the magic.

Anyway. That was all really.

We all have our Piglet moments sometimes.

After getting up this morning I wandered into the kitchen and was immediately confronted with a bargain of sorts. If I went to the corner shop to buy milk, my middle daughter would make me coffee and a bacon sandwich. While walking to the shop, I smiled to myself - realising that these are the stories I should write down - the stories I should remember.

I continue to struggle finding time to write. A window of opportunity opened at lunchtime, but before I knew it one thing after another conspired to slam it shut.

I'm not sure I have much to write about.

I was programming all day again. Working on a project that will hopefully see daylight in the new year. I missed lunch again. I really need to start taking lunch breaks and going for a walk. Either that, or going for a walk either before, or after work.

When I worked in Germany I would go for breakfast as soon as the hotel restaurant opened in the morning, and then head into the city for a walk - watching the bakeries, cafes and newspaper shops opening for the day ahead. I would pass endless runners alongside the river - stomping out a rhythm as they passed me.

Perhaps I need to do something like that - breakfast in town. I wonder how much it might cost? Maybe not every day - but once a week?

We all know I'm going to wake up, look at the clock, and disappear back under the bedcovers, don't we.

I'm not entirely sure where the last few days have gone. In-between chores, work, running, writing, more chores, more running, more work, more writing, and endlessly putting things away, two entire days have vanished.

I suppose the biggest news this week is that my other half is changing job. After something like 12 years working as "the lady in the office" at an infant school, she handed her notice in this morning. She starts her new job in about five weeks - working for a movie production company a few miles away. It's all very exciting.

I'm still doing the same job I've been doing forever - magicking bits and pieces of website and intranet out of nowhere for corporate behemoths. It's funny - when the writing comes easily I think "I could do this for a living", but I only really play at writing. Nobody would want to pay me to empty my head each day - or at least, I don't-? 1/2 *think*-? 1/2 they would. That said, I joined Medium a year or so ago, and tried out their partner programme - and made bank pretty quickly.

Anyway.

It's getting late.

I thought I should at least write a few words before collapsing onto the sofa in front of some ridiculous movie or TV show. Whenever I miss a day on the blog it starts to eat away at me like a fungus. Actually - that's not a very good analogy, is it - fungus grows on things - it doesn't eat them.

I'm too tired to think any more.

Oh - I went for another run this morning. I'm glad I did it, but still shocked how unfit I have become. I used to be able to run 5 kilometres a couple of times a week. It's going to take a while to get back to that.

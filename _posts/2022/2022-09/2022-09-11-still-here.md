Rumours of my demise have been greatly exaggerated (if indeed there were any). I can't remember the last time I let so many days go between blog posts. It's all slightly surreal really. It's not like I even missed writing - I just didn't think about writing at all - which is even more odd really, given that I've been writing pretty consistently for the last twenty-something years.

I've just been busy, I guess. Busy working, busy tinkering with projects, and not chasing my tail as I have for far too long. One good friend reached out to me this past week, to see if I was ok - and I was quite taken aback to think anybody really thinks about me - or my absence.

As I said - I'm fine. I'm doing good.

I stopped running this week, after pulling a muscle in my backside. Stop laughing. I told you I wasn't as fit any more - and pulling a muscle pretty much proved it. It started hurting while I was running the other day, and has taken the best part of a week to get better.

I haven't reached out to distant friends in quite some time, and I feel awful about it. I need to do something about that tomorrow - climb out of my hole, dust myself down, and wave in their direction.

It's 1am while writing this. I should probably go to bed. I'll write again tomorrow, I promise. It's kind of like getting on a horse, this writing business, isn't it?

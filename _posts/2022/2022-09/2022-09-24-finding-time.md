As a few might have noticed, I've returned to Wordpress. This had absolutely nothing to do with platforms - more about separation of concerns. I needed to use Substack for something else, and would rather have something of a dividing wall between my personal blog, and other endeavours.

So what have I been up to in my absence?

I started a damn fool escapade on the internet a few weeks ago, and it exploded in popularity - turning from a few minutes of my time into a full time second job. I'm doing it of my own volition though, so I only have myself to complain to.

I was up until 3am last night trying to find out what was eating disk space on a web server - this after going round in circles trying to find out why on earth something was failing - before realising the software was lying to me.

Today I spent the majority of the day at my youngest daughter's school - running a second hand book stall to help raise funds for the school. I ran the stall for the better part of three hours - greeting parents and children and attempting to part them with their money. While I sold books, my other half ran the perenially popular "lucky dip", and "hook a duck" games.

While setting the book stall up a man approached with his daughter, and spied a collection of perhaps 100 issues of a popular comic - obviously somebody's entire collection. He initially bought 10 issues, before returning later to take a second look. I offered him the entire collection for quite a small amount of money, and he said something that made me smile - "I'll never get away with it". He wasn't buying them for his children at all.

Anyway.

It's nice to be back. As time allows, I will try to catch up with some of the blogs I follow - to find out what you've been up to.

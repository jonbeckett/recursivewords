I've had the strangest feeling recently - that I'm in-between. Not just work projects, or chores, or whatever else. Something bigger. Something you can't quite describe, or relate to.

I'm not sure if it's that I'm changing, that a change is happening around me, or I'm just becoming aware of something different.

It's very odd.

In the past I've written about ends and beginnings - about the reciprocal nature of things. This feels more like a metamorphosis. I wonder if there's something in-between ends and beginnings - not so final, and not so dramatic. A transformation of sorts.

Perhaps it's to do with insight. Becoming aware. Observing. Taking notice.

Sometimes people talk about moments of clarity. Perhaps this is one of them - that I've noticed the shifting of the universe's sands. It's more a feeling than anything you might see, hear, or touch.

Like I said - it's very odd.

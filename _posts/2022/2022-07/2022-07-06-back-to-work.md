It's day five since the symptoms of COVID arrived like a car crash, and I'm back working. My brain is been in a bit of a fog for most of the day, but to be honest having something to get on with has been really good.

You know when you sit in the dead of night, and can hear the blood pumping through your ears? I have that sensation, but all the time. I can only imagine it's my body's way of saying 'I'm working really hard here - just give me a few days'.

Main lesson of the last few days? Redbush tea with honey in it was the only thing I felt like drinking. I've found that for the last few years, when ill. Thankfully I'm rarely sick - but when I am, I can't stomach coffee. Go figure.

I'm back drinking coffee today.

I wonder how much of the day one headache was caffeine withdrawal, and how much was COVID going on a wrecking-spree around my head?

Anyway.

Today has been a good day (so far). Let's see how the evening goes.

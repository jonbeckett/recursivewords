It's Friday morning - or at least I think it's still Friday morning - and I'm taking a break from work for a few minutes. I'm actually thinking about abandoning work for the rest of the day - COVID seems to be taking a second bite out of me. It might be better to admit defeat, have a quiet weekend, and give my body a chance to repair itself.

I need to get some more Redbush tea - I went through almost an entire box of it earlier in the week.

Maybe a quiet book today. Or sleep. We'll see.

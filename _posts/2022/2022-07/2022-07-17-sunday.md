If news reports are to be believed, the temperature here is going to reach 38 centigrade by tomorrow afternoon. I can't see a lot of work getting done somehow. Of course somebody has a work meeting scheduled for the hottest part of the day - I can't wait to see how many people don't turn on their webcam.

I wonder if I can get away with only wearing clothes that are in-view for conference calls? I suppose it might be interesting if I have to answer the door though - perhaps I should have the Superman bath robe the kids bought me for Christmas one year at the ready.

Imagine if I forgot, and appeared in a very serious call, wrapped in a deep blue towelling robe with red piping, and the superman logo on the chest.

Perhaps I should get the music ready to play when I appear ?

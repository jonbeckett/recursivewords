A very short post this Friday afternoon that will mean very little to very few. My blog posts originate from an account at Substack, and are cross-posted automagically into Tumblr and Wordpress by the cloud magicians at Zapier. Thus far the account name at Substack has been "jonathanwrotethis", and it has always annoyed me a bit, because it's not the same as my Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook account names.

No more!

I changed the substack domain name to match the others, before some other person wanders along with the same name. I know it isn't really that important, but it satisfies the OCD scratch that was getting increasingly itchy.

Anyway!

It's Friday afternoon, and work is winding down for the week. I'm looking forward to a weekend visiting friends, eating pizza, and drinking cider. I'm easily pleased.

Oh - I almost forgot - I had a dream about being haunted last night. And the night before that had a dream about a great white chasing me in a small boat with an outboard motor. I wonder what it all means?

Just before shutting up for the day, I want to thank all those that read my words. I know I don't always write the most exciting words, but they're my words, they're (usually) the truth, and hopefully they don't do any harm.

I'm not sure what I might do if I wasn't allowed to have this little corner of the internet to broadcast nonsense from. Probably start talking to plants or something.

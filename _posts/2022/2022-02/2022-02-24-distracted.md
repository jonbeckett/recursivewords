It's been difficult to concentrate today given the unfolding story in the Ukraine. Don't worry - I'm not going to write about it. I'm not qualified or knowledgeable enough to really have an opinion. It's just so sad, frustrating, and worrying - for all sorts of reasons.

I need to think about something else. Some normality. I've been trying to focus on work, but it's difficult.

My post a few days ago about the importance of friendship has been brought into focus today. Without each other the world is a cold and lonely place. When everything else is removed, we are just people - doing our best - putting one foot in front of the other - fostering hopes and dreams for the future.

If you're in a similar frame of mind today, feel free to reach out.

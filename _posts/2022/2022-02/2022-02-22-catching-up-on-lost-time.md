I'm sitting in front of the computer at the end of the working day, listening to a random playlist on a free spotify account. How is it only Tuesday?

I'm shattered, and I only have myself to blame. I was up until 2am last night - avoiding today. It wasn't that anything particularly difficult or stressful was happening - just switching work projects for a few days.

Jumping between projects can either feel like a vacation or a nightmare. Sometimes switching subjects in your brain is a real wrench - trying to remember why certain decisions were made, or why things were done in the way they were. The worst case scenario is always being parachuted into another project - to either pick up the pieces or the slack of an invariably tangled mess.

Anyway. I don't write about work - not directly.

While working from home over the last couple of years, I've gained an appreciation of friends - be that in the "real world", or over the internet. They make otherwise lonely days much easier to bear.

As Norah Ephron once wrote, sometimes all it takes is a message saying hello, I'm here, and by the way, on the other hand, nevertheless, did you see this? - whatever it is friends share with you, it's a reminder that you count to somebody - and that's a nice feeling.

Sometimes you cross paths with somebody and become instant friends - racing to share anything and everything - catching up on lost time. It's rare, but it's wonderful when it happens.

Is it coffee o'clock yet?

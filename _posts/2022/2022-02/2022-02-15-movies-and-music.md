I've been sitting in the dark of the junk room in front of the computer for quite some time now - wondering where the words are going to come from this evening. Sometimes they don't.

Having been away last week, catching up with work projects over the last few days has been something of a scramble. I'm only too aware that I'm terrible at multi-tasking - and given the complex nature of my work, it's easy to make mistakes.

I'll get there. Slowly. I'm leaning on the bullet journal quite a bit to plan, organise and remain somewhat mindful of things that need my attention throughout each day.

Like I said - I'll get there.

Since returning home the weather has been spectacularly bad. I delivered lunch to my other half yesterday in the rain, and got soaked through to the underwear. This morning I fetched washing in from the line that had been left out in the rain, and got soaked again. It's almost like the weather man has something against me.

("The weather man" is a childhood memory from a "Rupert" story book, where the weather was created by a man that lived in the clouds, operating vast and complex machinery)

While sitting here in the dark, a radio station is playing "Love Lift Us Up Where We Belong". I'm trying to remember which movie it was used in - "An Officer and a Gentleman" ?

While talking to a friend yesterday, a few movies came to mind that I've not seen for years - among them "Some Kind of Wonderful". It's one of my favourite "brat pack" movies, along with "Pretty in Pink", "The Breakfast Club", and "St Elmos Fire".

Ah crap - now I'm going to have to go and find "Man in Motion" by John Parr - the title track from the "St Elmo's Fire". Great song.

While emptying my head about movies and music of the era, have you seen "Red Oaks" ?  It's a series on Amazon Prime about a young man working his summers at a country club in the US during the late 1980s. It's kind of wonderful.

A cover of "You Raise Me Up" just started playing on the radio. My brain makes all kinds of connections from it - to Josh Groban, and then on to Idina Menzel (who performed in "Chess" alongside him about ten years ago). All routes eventually lead back to Idina Menzel...

Ah crap - I'll be listening to "Seasons of Love" from "Rent" before we know it. Have you heard the original cast recording done for charity during the Pandemic? It's wonderful - following the link below:

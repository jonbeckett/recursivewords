It's an hour into the working day, and I'm taking a coffee break. I've become terrible recently for working straight through the day without stopping. Invariably at lunchtime you will find me still sitting in front of the computer with a hastily made sandwich on a plate between myself and the keyboard - taking a bite inbetween typing.

Thankfully my calendar is bereft of meetings today - affording me the chance to "clear the decks" - to spend some time organising thoughts, planning, and to perhaps get a little ahead of the game.

I have the computer connected to the bluetooth speaker in the corner of the room - it's belting out an Elton John compilation album at the moment. He's singing "I Guess That's Why They Call It The Blues" - I can still remember the first time I heard it - on a Saturday morning children's TV show called "Number 73" about thirty five years ago. Isn't it odd how particular moments stick in your mind.

I remember first hearing Tori Amos while getting ready to go to college one day. She was promoting the "Little Earthquakes" album, and the video for "Winter" played during a breakfast television segment. I bought the album that weekend, and played it to death. She was the subject of a huge interview in "Q" magazine a few months later - titled "Hips, Lips, Tits, Power".

Just think how much useful information could have been stored in my head if it hadn't become filled with the songs of Tori Amos and Elton John, and the countless brat pack movies I watched on-repeat during that period.

Anyway.

Coffee break over. Time to get back to work.

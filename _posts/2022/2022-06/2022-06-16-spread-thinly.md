How is it Thursday already? Where do the days go? It feels like my feet haven't touched the ground all week. Take today as an example - somehow I've filled and emptied the dishwasher, thrown three loads of clothes through the washing machine and hung them out to dry, sprayed the bedroom, stairs, and living room with flea spray (never get cats), hoovered all over, picked up after everybody, AND got on with work.

And it's only just after lunchtime.

I'm taking half an hour off from everything to write this, and listen to some music. I use my phone with a bluetooth speaker in the study that my cousin gave me. I have a free spotify subscription, and choose random playlists each day.

I only have one curated playlist of my own - that I compiled with the help of an old friend - filled with 70s, 80s and 90s classics. Whenever I listen to it I think of them now - and wonder how they are.

Anyway.

Time to go grab a glass of water. Now the weather is getting warmer, it doesn't do to stay sitting at the desk for too long - and apparently water intake is the best way to avoid my feet swelling up (it happened last year). I imagine the gallons of coffee I drink can't help either.

I'll writing again when I get a chance.

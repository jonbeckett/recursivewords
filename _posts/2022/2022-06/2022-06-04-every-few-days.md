Has anybody seen my blogging horse? Or was it a bicycle? I never was good at idioms and analogies.

It's Saturday morning (just). The UK has been taken over by patriotic fervour as really rather too many people celebrate the stunning achievement of an entitled family to continue to live a charmed life, paid for by all of us.

I'm not quite nailing my colours to the mast in saying that - the royal family make quite a lot for the country in terms of tourism, but really - why on earth does a modern country *need* a hereditary monarchy?

Anyway.

While writing this my other half and youngest daughter are in town selling hand-crafted bags, pencil cases, and tea-towels as part of a "Wild" weekend of events - promoting nature, conservation, and ecology. The weather is not helping them - while it was warm and sunny yesterday, today it's cold, windy, and spitting with rain.

I feel sorry for our youngest daughter - she has spent several weeks making hand-stamped designs on the various items they are selling - and given the weather, foot traffic in the park is going to be almost non existent.

In other news, work is going well. As per usual, I can't really talk about it. Outside of work, the YouTube channel is getting bigger and bigger - like a snowball rolling down a hillside. After a few months I'll report on the earnings from it - at the moment it's making far more than I had anticipated, but I'm naturally pessimistic the longer term.

Time for a coffee, perhaps.

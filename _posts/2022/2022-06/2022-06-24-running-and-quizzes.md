After work yesterday evening I pulled on my running shoes and went for a run around town. It seemed like a good idea at the time - but I had completely forgotten that the junk room / study where I sit for most of the day is on the cold side of the house. I knew I had made a mistake minutes into the run, when the air might well have been made from treacle.

Let's just say it's a bit humid at the moment. And hot. While running, I started to wonder if my body might complain about what I was putting it through - and could feel my chest tightening after a few minutes. After perhaps 10 minutes running, I gave in and walked for a while.

It's perhaps no surprise that as I started to struggle, an ambulance and a fast response car passed me. My suspicions of starring in my own version of The Truman Show are as large as ever.

Later in the evening we trooped off down to the pub to meet friends for a pub quiz. Getting to the pub in time for the quiz was something of a challenge (for all of us), but once there we managed to forget about everything for a while and just have fun.

When it got to the 'scoring the rounds' part of the quiz, we became aware of a very, very serious table with two men sat at it. Every quiz has one of those tables doesn't it. Men of a certain age, obviously single, no sense of humour, and this is probably their entire world. Think Benedict Cumberbatch in Starter for Ten.

We weren't really there for the quiz - it was an excuse. We were there to spend time with friends. Late in the evening - after returning home - I messaged the group chat that had resulted in the night out - and remarked how lucky we are to have such good friends.

There's an old saying, isn't there - about being so busy you forget to live. I'm often guilty of that.

Since stepping back from posting 'every other day' to the blog, I've discovered a paradox of sorts. While I thought having a few days between posts might conjure stories worth telling, the reality is that by the time I sit down to write anything, I've forgotten the stories worth telling.

Norah Ephron was right about recording the exhales. If I don't record my thoughts on the same day they happen, then get over-written by the rest of the mayhem that generally surrounds me.

Anyway.

What have I been up to? Working. And then working some more. I'm learning the ropes with a number of new (to me) programming languages, platforms, and technologies - and it's kind of been all-consuming. It's not a purely academic exercise either - it's a somewhat important commercial project. Unfortunately I can't share any more than that.

There have been several days in the past few weeks when I've forgotten to stop for lunch - which doesn't do my body much good at all. While talking to a friend across the way that often walks her dog, I suggested she might knock on the window and encourage me to join her - if only for a few minutes. We somehow have to engineer it so she appears in the window while I'm on a conference call - just to get my co-workers talking.

We finished watching Obi-Wan Kenobi this evening. I liked it. We're also half-way through watching Dune (the new version - not the old one with Sting in). We need to set aside an entire evening to watch the rest of it - it's a LONG film, but what we've seen so far has been wonderful. I've also promised to watch 'Orphan Black', so the earlier mentioned friend has somebody to talk to about it. It's funny how television and movies become such a connection between people, isn't it.

I'll try and post a bit more often to the blog in the coming weeks. The more mundane stuff - like this post. I've kind of missed emptying my head. Finding the time to do so will always be the challenge - I'm writing this at nearly 1am.

Somebody take the keyboard away from me - I obviously cannot be trusted. While taking a break from research and development on a work project this afternoon I lifted my personal blog in the air, threw it into what can only be described as a cloud-powered infinite improbability drive, and have rather miraculously ended up with a new blog.

Perhaps the term "miraculously" is a little disingenuous. This afternoon's escapade was made possible only by standing on the shoulders of far more industrious developers that did exactly what developers tend to do - when faced with building something, they don't just build something - they build the thing that builds the something.

Of course if you're reading this at Wordpress or Tumblr, you're only seeing a pale imitation of the results of my idiocy. Your words were brought to you by a daemon in the cloud called "Zapier" that watches what I'm up to all day.

Anyway.

The work day has just finished (hence having time to pollute the internet with these words), and my cooking, washing up, and tidying up services are probably required elsewhere in the house.

I promise to return to less tinker-filled programming tomorrow.

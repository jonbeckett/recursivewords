It's been a few days since I last polluted the internet with any thoughts. I think the biggest surprise to me is that I haven't really missed writing. I thought I would.

Life continues to be quiet.

Saying that, we have been invited out to visit neighbours for dinner this evening - a reunion of sorts of school parents - our children progressed through junior school together. It's going to be fun.

While sitting out on the green with neighbours a few of weeks ago - an excuse we all used to use to grab a drink with each other - the conversation turned to what we had all been doing over the past year or so. Guilty admission followed guilty admission. Nobody had really done anything. Nothing has become the new normal.

I kept quiet about descending into my own Abed Nadir world of pretend aeroplanes (Community reference - we've been binge-watching it at home recently).

Actually - while mentioning Community - perhaps you can clear this up for me. In the middle of the LEGO Movie, Emmet names a number of cats that cross his path. The final cat has a deep voice, and is introduced as "Jeff". I'm pretty sure it's Joel McHale, "Jeff Winger" from Community. I wonder if anybody has ever jumped down the internet rabbit hole to find that one out?

Anyway. We need to go soon, so I should stop writing. Maybe I'll just pause here, and write more when I get home...

(and entire evening passes)

It's now 11am on Sunday morning. I've already cut the lawn.

Last night was fun. It's easy to become stuck in an insular world of work, chores, errands and so on - before you know it, you haven't seen friends for months or even years.

The evening whistled by. We laughed, told stories, reminisced about the past, and looked forward to the future together. Our children are all growing up. While we are of course apprehensive for them, we're also adjusting to a new normal of our own - our lives are changing too.

We got home just before our daughters, who returned from the pub where Miss 18 had worked until closing time.

In other news, I've begun stripping away the results of recent tinkering - reducing the blog to it's core at Wordpress. Given my sphere of work there is always going to be a temptation to delve into the machinery of the internet, and lose sight of the reason I am here in the first place. While I might not agree with walled gardens, platforms, and "the man", there are benefits to "just writing", and taking advantage of platforms I don't have to look after.

Anyway.

The remains of Sunday are stretched out ahead of me. Perhaps a cup of coffee might be a good first step.

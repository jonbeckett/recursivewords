I've decided to step back from the internet for a while. Slow down.

I STILL have a huge pile of books I've not read, a LOT of movies I've never seen, and a LOT of TV shows I've never seen a single episode of.

It's time to climb out of the internet rabbit hole.

I'll pop back in every few days of course - as I have been - and perhaps I'll have stories to tell :)

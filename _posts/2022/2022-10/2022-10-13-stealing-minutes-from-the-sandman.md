You find me sitting in the dark at 1am again. I'm not entirely sure how this keeps happening. One minute I'm washing up the things from dinner - the next everybody else has gone to bed, and I'm here tinkering with a few different projects and losing track of time.

I worked straight through lunch again today. I'm getting worse at it. While concentrating on something I seem to have an infinite capacity to just 'keep going'. It can't be good for me. By the time I realised it was mid-afternoon. I ended up making a sandwich out of leftovers. It was a good sandwich.

Anyway. I guess this is just 'a few words', rather than none at all. I seem to be making a habit of that at the moment - writing in the cracks of everything else going on - or stealing minutes from the sandman to empty my head into the internet.

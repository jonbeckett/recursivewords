Do you ever feel like you're drowning in the various projects you're involved in - but also realise that you started each project? I suppose you could say I'm terrible at saying no to myself.

I was supposed to go for a run this morning - to begin getting some miles under my belt ahead of a charity fun run in December. I woke up with the alarm clock at 7am, and then fell asleep for another twenty minutes (and had a weird dream - I seem to be having a lot of weird dreams recently).

It doesn't help that I've been playing the "stay up late to avoid tomorrow" game - although the game seems to have transformed into "stay up late to do more things today". I need to just stop. Slow down. Step back. An acquaintance who has been witness to one of the online projects I've been tinkering with asked "do you ever sleep?" - another friend chipped in with "he's a robot".

Anyway.

Today I'm going out for lunch. A group of us from work are gathering at a pub within walking distance of my house. It will be nice to see some of my co-workers - working from home is great, but it's also a bit like a fish-bowl most days (a fish bowl that also contains laundry, washing up, and tidying up after the rest of the house guests).

Time is marching on. I should fire up my work laptop.

Did you see that Elon is going ahead with the acquisition of Twitter? Do you have a Twitter account? Are you now part of the angry mob with pitchforks? I will admit to not quite understanding what the big issue is - you know, apart from him wanting to open the gates of the underworld. If I see Rick Moranis stumbling around the internet in search of Sigourney Weaver, I'll know exactly how it's playing out.

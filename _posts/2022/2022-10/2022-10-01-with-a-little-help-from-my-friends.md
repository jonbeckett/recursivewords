We went out last night - to help a good friend celebrate her birthday. We met at her house, summoned a taxi, and had the best night out in quite some time. A lovely meal, a few drinks, and lots of stories, laughter and smiles along the way.

I'm SO tired today. Miraculously I didn't have a hangover this morning.

You know the funny thing? The whole "night out" part of it was kind of superfluous. I would have been just as happy to have gone for a walk or sat on a park bench with my friends and caught up with each other. The rest - the meal, the drinks and so on - that's all driven by convention.

All you really need is to be together with those you love.

Love is such a divisive word - but only because people make it so. I love my friend's smiles, their laughter, their stories, and the experiences we have shared over the years. I love spending time with them, helping shoulder their stresses, and just "being there".

I remember reading many years ago that you can tell a true friend because you can sit together without making conversation. It's the piglet thing again, isn't it.

It's odd though. I'm a pretty solitary person too. I sometimes struggle to step outside the door - to get over myself. I do though, and I'm always thankful afterwards.

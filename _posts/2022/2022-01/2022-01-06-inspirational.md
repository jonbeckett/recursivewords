This year I'm taking part in "[Bloganuary](https://bloganuary.wordpress.com/)" - a series of writing prompts published throughout the month by [Mindy Postoff](https://bloganuary.wordpress.com/author/mindywoothemes/). Today's writing prompt is "Who is someone that inspires you and why?".

I'm going to answer today's writing prompt somewhat indirectly.

I tend not to hero worship, or put anybody on pedestals, so naming an individual as an inspiration seems false. As the social internet has amplified celebrity, and more notable influencers have leaned into audience manipulation, reinvention of self, and the curation of alternate realities, I have become increasingly disillusioned by anybody that projects an ideal, an image, or a way of life.

In recent months I have begun searching the internet for honesty and transparency - searching for people telling their own story - their adventures, ideas, thoughts, hopes and dreams. Quiet voices of truth.

While it's easy to be drowned out by armies of keyboard warriors fighting perceived injustices, or furthering ill-conceived idealistic crusades, some people continue placing one foot in front of the other, and find their own way through the mayhem - continuing to tell their own story.

Those are the people that inspire me.

This year I'm taking part in "[Bloganuary](https://bloganuary.wordpress.com/)" - a series of writing prompts published throughout the month by [Mindy Postoff](https://bloganuary.wordpress.com/author/mindywoothemes/). Today's writing prompt is "What is your favourite photo you've ever taken?"

About fourteen years ago now our long journey towards adoption was completed, and we went from a family of two to a family of five overnight.

In the weeks and months that followed we were repeatedly asked by family and friends for photos. One day - in-between watching Dora the Explorer, doing jigsaws, running around the garden, and completing the endless chores that children bring about, I managed to sit the children down for long enough to take a half-decent photo.

It's always been a favourite.

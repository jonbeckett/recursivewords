*This year I'm taking part in "*[*Bloganuary*](https://bloganuary.wordpress.com/)*" - a series of writing prompts published throughout the month by* [*Mindy Postoff*](https://bloganuary.wordpress.com/author/mindywoothemes/)*. Today's writing prompt is "Write about a challenge you faced and overcame.".*

I'm coming up with very little for today's writing prompt. Perhaps this is some kind of mid-month malaise - the result of having answered all the various "Bloganuary" writing prompts so far, and slowly depleting the energy devoted to scribbling half-sensible words.

(frowns for a few moments)

I think I've got something worth writing about. Does running count?

In the months before the first lockdown I took part in a "Couch to 5K" programme at the local running club - mostly to support my daughter. It's worth noting that I didn't sign up for the programme - my other half volunteered me. That kind of thing happens a *lot* around here.

Anyway.

After running with a rag-tag group of non-runners for a couple of months, we eventually "graduated" - running five kilometres around town together. 

I think perhaps the biggest take-away from running with the group was that it made the entire escapade a lot easier. When I run on my own (which I still do fairly regularly), there is no peer pressure to get out on anything like a regular basis - but while attending the organised runs with the group, both myself and my daughter lifted ourselves by our own bootstraps. We showed up. We ran.

*This year I'm taking part in "[Bloganuary](https://bloganuary.wordpress.com/)" - a series of writing prompts published throughout the month by [Mindy Postoff](https://bloganuary.wordpress.com/author/mindywoothemes/). Today's writing prompt is "What do you like most about your writing ?".*

Today's writing prompt is perhaps the most difficult for me to answer so far - because it forces me to look inwards. I don't tend to do a lot of self-analysis. My words are usually pretty transparent - of the moment. I write about whatever subject is in my head.

Maybe that's it. Maybe the thing I like most about my writing is that it isn't contrived. I don't pretend to be somebody I'm not. I'm not playing a part, or portraying a character. I'm just a fairly straightforward guy that likes to write, sharing his thoughts with the world.

Back in the mists of time - before marketers got hold of the world wide web and insisted that everything should have purpose, polish, and dance with the woke brigade in terms of being politically correct, blogs were just diarys. Journals. People emptying their head into the keyboard late at night - expressing frustrations, divulging secrets, and chasing wishes.

I'm fully aware that I'm something of a throwback. A balrog in blogging terms. A writer of the old world. And I'm good with that.

Of course the trick is finding kindred spirits that we share at least a few character flaws with - so we might accompany each other along the winding road.

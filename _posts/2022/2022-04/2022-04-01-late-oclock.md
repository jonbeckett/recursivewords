I cooked dinner for the rest of the family this evening. Spaghetti Bolognese - one of the "make something quick that everybody will eat" meals that most families have up their sleeve at the end of a long week.

After dinner I joined some friends online for an hour, before heading into town to meet my middle daughter from work once again. Before leaving the house I looked in on my other half, and asked if she wanted to come - to perhaps get a drink while there. And that's how we didn't get home until after closing time.

While sipping our drink, and talking about the week, we laughed at the teenagers in the bar - most of which we had known at the various schools our girls attended over the years. We figured we had known more than a few of them since they were in infant school. One of them couldn't take a shot at the pool-table without shouting the F word. I wondered how proud his parents might be.

Walking to and from the pub was bitterly cold. Earlier today it tried to snow. Only a few flakes, but still exciting given that we haven't seen any serious amount of snowfall for years.

Tomorrow we're headed to our youngest's school for some sort of garden tour thing. Then on Sunday it's rugby once again. I'm not going to stress too much about not getting a chance to rest - I have a week off coming up at the end of next week. The week before Easter.

That reminds me - I need to get some Easter eggs.

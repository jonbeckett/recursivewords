Here I am again, sitting in front of the computer in the dead of night, only too aware that I haven't posted for several days. The world just seems to be getting away from me at the moment - I'm not sure if I'm just trying to be involved in too many things, or if I'm not pedalling fast enough.

I can't help reminding myself of a message I've seen written by several friends recently - that it's ok not to chase your own tail - that it's ok to say no - that there is value in slowing down.

There are so many things I want to do though. I end up laughing at myself - I have always been my own worst enemy.

Last night we went out to a fund-raiser at the infant school where my other half works - propping up the "staff table". It was supposed to be a quiz, but involved little or no knowledge. One of the rounds involved identifying the flavour of jelly beans. On the way home I opined that this is the future - whether we like it or not. Generations are coming through where the majority seem to have have no knowledge about anything much in the world. If they haven't seen something on Facebook, Tiktok, or their friends haven't texted them about it, they have no clue. The traditional subjects - history, geography, science, nature, art - you may as well be asking them to write out the equations of motion.

One particular table at the fund raiser stunned us by leaving a considerable amount of rubbish, empty bottles and food wrappers strewn across their table and the floor when they left. Because of course we were there to clean up after them. What is it with some people thinking the rest of the world is there to serve them? How conceited are they?

While walking home - furious with the many small slights that had mounted up throughout the night - I had to remind myself that none of it really mattered. Less than half a world away, a catastrophe is being discovered - with evidence that the retreating army of a superpower have massacred civilians en-masse.

I will admit that in recent weeks I've wondered what the point of it all is - this life thing - when you could be cut down tomorrow. Why do we strive, hope, dream, or even attempt to build when a hostile adversary can invade, kill, and destroy with wanton abandon? How do soldiers of any army reconcile their actions? How do they live with what they have done? Can people really be conditioned to such an extent that they become machines without conscience ? Sadly experience of conflict around the world seems to tell me they can.

Suddenly the method I use to get from one day to the next seems like a good one - putting one foot in front of the other. When the world seems a little too big, and a little too loud, concentrating on putting one foot in front of the other works well. It gets me from today to tomorrow - and tomorrow it will get me to the next day.

The real trick is finding somebody to walk alongside while finding my way from today to tomorrow. I'm lucky enough to count several such people in my sort-of-secret group of far flung friends on the internet. We might not message each other every day, but when we do, the world becomes a little bit smaller, and a little bit easier to survive.

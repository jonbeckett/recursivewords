After scraping myself out of bed this morning, I wandered downstairs and was met by our youngest daughter - who was incredibly excited at the prospect of me opening her present. She bought me chocolate. Lots and lots of chocolate. Enough chocolate to probably hospitalise you if you ate it in one sitting.

The rest of the day has unfolded in a largely similar manner to many over the last several years - sitting in front of a computer, persuading both the computer and the internet to do my bidding. It's a funny way of explaining software and web development, isn't it - but strangely accurate - a conversation with the machinery of the internet, suggesting it organise itself in such a way as to solve a particular problem.

Anyway.

I'm writing this while sipping coffee. A short break before downing tools for the day, pulling on a new shirt, and walking to the pub in town with my family for a meal out. When we get home I have a movie ready and waiting.

I'm not one for resolutions or long term goals. I'm more about putting one foot in front of the other, and seeing where I end up. I made it through today, which is something I guess.

I wonder what tomorrow will bring?

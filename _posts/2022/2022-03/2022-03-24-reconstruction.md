After a few days break from the blogging universe - during which time I built myself a rather lovely island on the internet and then quite predictably burned it to the ground - I'm quietly re-connecting a little this evening.

I'm still not sure if it's a good idea.

Time appears to be my enemy at the moment - which invites it's own guilt trip. It feels like I haven't kept in touch with anybody for quite some time now. I need to devote an entire evening to just writing emails, calling people, and so on. I know men are traditionally terrible at the whole social thing, but it's no excuse really.

I suppose working from home hasn't helped much. While out for dinner with close friends last night we talked a little about it - about not leaving the house for days on end sometimes -about working through countless lunchtimes. It's a slippery slope.

I really do need to get the running shoes back out, and force myself out of the house early on a morning. I love running as the rest of the world wakes up - seeing deliveries arrive in the high street, newspaper boys and girls, bakeries opening their doors. It's the best part of the day.

Anyway. It's getting late.

I just spent the last half an hour catching up with my cousin in California, rather than finish writing this. I suppose that gives you some insight into how easily I fall down rabbit holes - I wrote that paragraph earlier about needing to catch up - and messaged her in another browser tab. When the tab starts flashing to tell me she has replied, I can't carry on writing - or at last I try to, but the little flashing notification eventually chips away my resistance.

Maybe if I just switch the computer off, that will work? (he says, knowing Messenger will just start vibrating on his phone instead).

Holy crap - it's nearly 1am. How does that happen. Every. Single. Night ?!

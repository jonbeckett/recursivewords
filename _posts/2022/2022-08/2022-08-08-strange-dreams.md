I woke early this morning, moments after a radio station filled the bedroom with music from decades past. After spending several minutes watching light patterns dance across the wall, and listening to birds singing in the trees outside, I fell back asleep.

The next hour conjured the strangest dream I have experienced in quite some time.

I was in the house I grew up in, and a car pulled onto the drive. Lots of people climbed from the car, singing some sort of happy-clappy religious song - led by the late husband of an old work colleague. They opened the front door, and flooded into the house - singing as they began filing into the various rooms.

I confronted the leader, and asked him to please leave. He ignored me, and began singing louder.

Giving up on reasoning, I grabbed the sides of his body, and lifted him into the air. As I carried him through the house, his body seemed strangely rigid and light - as if he were a mannequin. I threw him back through the front-door as one might a sack of mail - and began turning, picking up, and throwing each of the nearest of his followers - who were still singing.

And then I woke up.

I've been thinking about the dream all morning. While picking the people up, I questioned to their face why they had no mind of their own - why the were blindly following others.

They just kept singing.

After a slow day rattling around my parents house, we escaped to the beach yesterday. A day of sun, sea, sand, and ice creams. We guessed that Saturday may be "change-over" day for many families visiting the coast, so might be the best day to visit the beach - and suspect we were proven right. Not only did we find a parking space in a nearby car-park - we also found space on the beach without difficulty to set-up camp for the day.

No sooner had we arrived, I found myself in the sea with my youngest daughter. I'm convinced she has Frost Giant blood in her veins - while she immediately made her way into the surf, I took a few minutes. While larking around we looked up and down the beach, and realised we were among only a handful of people in the water - a select group of cheerful idiots.

The rest of the day was spent eating ice creams, reading books, and people watching on the beach. I find people endlessly fascinating - especially in places where all manner of different backgrounds are brought together. While quietly sitting on the beach a young lad a few yards away stood up, pointing at a seagull attempting to steal food, and shouted (very politely) "Excuse me Mr Seagull - can you GO AWAY!" - it was all I could do not to burst out laughing.

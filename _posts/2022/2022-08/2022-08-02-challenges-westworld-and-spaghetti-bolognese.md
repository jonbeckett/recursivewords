Today has been a difficult day. A work project suffered a setback, and while nobody in particular did anything "wrong", you can't help wondering if there was something you could have done that might have resulted in a different outcome. Hindsight is a wonderful thing.

I don't typically write about work, so I'll leave it there.

In other news, I started watching season 4 of "Westworld" last night. Somehow it's production completely passed me by. I'm two episodes in, and wow. Just wow. One of the most intricate, clever plots I have seen in a TV show - it keeps the cogs turning throughout.

I'm writing this during a quick break from work - I didn't really stop at lunchtime.

I'm making spaghetti bolognese for dinner tonight. Before that can happen I have to ask the kids to fold the clothes that are stacked across the dining room table. I wonder how much encouragement will be required to make that happen?

Anyway. Better get on.

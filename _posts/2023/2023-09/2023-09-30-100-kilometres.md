I did it!! After a month of running almost every morning (even while on holiday), and then navigating a household wading through the latest covid spike, I made it to 100km to raise funds for Great Ormond Street Hospital.

I've never attempted anything remotely like this, and am not going to pretend it was easy. I've been carrying several injuries throughout, probably had covid myself a couple of weeks ago without realising, and ran the final few kilometres with the aid of ibuprofen gel.

I think I've earned Dominos for dinner tonight, and a week off running before perhaps just doing park-run now and again for the forseeable future :)

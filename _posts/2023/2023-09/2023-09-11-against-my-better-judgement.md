I'm giving Wordpress another chance. I immediately noticed while catching up on recent posts in the "Reader" interface that the "like" button worked perhaps 50% of the time. I'll pretend it didn't happen.

I've been away - experimenting with Substack. Some of you came with me. I've tried to avoid spamming anybody with recent posts by posting them as "private", and then changing them to public - which I *hope* didn't result in emails flying in all directions over the last half hour.

*Ah crap - a close friend just emailed me and asked why she just received an in-box full of email. Sorry!*

I've copied the subscriptions over, so if you were following me at Substack, you're still following me at Wordpress - you don't have to do *anything*.

Anyway - not much news to report today - I'm taking a day off from running (if you scroll back through [recent posts](https://jonbeckett.blog/2023/09) you'll find out what I've been up to). I'm giving my rapidly deteriorating body a chance to repair itself before launching into the next 50 kilometres. I'm still kind of amazed that my body is holding together. A month ago I could just about run 5 kilometres every few days - at the start of this month I did it 10 times in 10 days.

I guess we're capable of far more than we think we are.

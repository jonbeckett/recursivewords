I ran again this morning. The sixth "5K" in a row. Thirty kilometres down. Seventy to go. This morning was pretty tough. Every morning seems to be tough at the moment - I guess that's what happens when you run *every day*.

I'm home alone today! It's very strange.

Both my youngest and eldest daughters left for college this morning, shortly before my middle daughter left for work.

I'm particularly pleased for our eldest, who has been battling her own demons for the last several years. She signed up for college early in the summer, without really knowing what she wanted to do - just wanting to get back into "the world" really. After attending an onboarding day at her preferred college yesterday, she came home in shock - having signed up for a two year almost-full-time course that started *today*.

It's an opportunity for her to make friends, and to start making her way in the world without relying on us so much.

We're not so worried about our youngest - she tends to land on her feet, is determined, stubborn, and a self-learner. She'll be fine. She takes a little longer than most of us with academic subjects, but has enthusiasm, and a willingness to please. That tends to go a long way.

Now everybody is out of the house, inbetween work I've been clearing the decks - re-filling the dishwasher, cleaning the kitchen, hoovering the *entire damn house*, and filling the washing machine repeatedly. I should be paid by clothes-line manufacturers to stress-test their products.

Anyway.

It's lunchtime. Time to go make something to eat. And time to see if I can actually relax for half an hour.

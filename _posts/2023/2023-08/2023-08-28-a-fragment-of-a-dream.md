A few days ago it occurred to me that I hadn't been sick for quite some time. Of course I was tempting fate. I woke up yesterday with a completely blocked nose and got worse throughout the day.

I went to bed after dinner last night and fell fast asleep straight away - waking up in the early hours with a completely clogged-up head again. And then couldn't fall asleep.

I eventually got up at about 5am, wandered downstairs, had a shower, cleared the washing up from last night (because OF COURSE nobody did any washing up in my absence), and now find myself holed up in the junk room with a word processor in front of me.

"Word processor" is a bit of a stretch. I've fallen back towards using a simple text editor to write blog posts.

Anyway.

Enough about me and my maladies.

I had a bizarre dream the night before last, and it's STILL in my head now. I'm pretty sure it won't leave my head, having survived for 24 hours, but I'm sharing it anyway.

I have no idea how the situation arose that I found myself in - my dreams invariably make little or no sense - so we'll just go with it.

I was sitting on the edge of a bed, upstairs in a friend's house. It's worth noting that I've never been upstairs in this person's house, so how my brain managed to extrapolate an entire upstairs is anybody's guess.

While sitting, and talking, she busied herself around the room before sitting down next to me. I think we were sharing confidences of some kind - frustrations, or uncertainties within our respective worlds. In a proper "sliding door moment" filled with uncertainty and trepidation, as silence fell upon the room I quietly leaned in and kissed her.

Isn't it funny how your brain can remember every detail of a made-up moment, but little else? I don't remember the conversation - but I do remember the feeling of panic - everything in my head telling me this was wrong - that it couldn't be undone - that this was a stupid thing to do.

She kissed back. A tender, quiet, lingering kiss.

What the hell do you do in that situation? When you're in over your head, and you don't know how to get out, or even if you want to get out, or if this is the best thing that has ever happened or the worst thing that's ever happened?

I WOKE UP!

WHAT THE HELL?

And OF COURSE, we know how the universe works - you can never go back into a dream - it doesn't work like that. The next dream would probably have been about walking across a muddy field, or going on an adventure on a boat, or finding a cave under the kitchen floor - or any ridiculous story.

I'll never find out what happened, and that makes me a little bit sad. Of course, a rational voice on my shoulder says "Well of course you can find out", but then a chorus of voices on the other shoulder start shouting "THIS ISN'T 'YOU'VE GOT MAIL'! THIS IS THE REAL WORLD!"

And so here I am, sniffing, squirting evil gunk up my nose, and drinking tea before everybody else gets up - re-playing the moment in the dream over and over again in my head, and wondering if I should even have written it down.

And on that note, I just spotted the packet of chocolate biscuits I bought yesterday and hid from myself. It's a bit early for chocolate biscuits though. Maybe a cup of tea first.

A cup of tea and a rubbish movie.

It's a bank holiday here today. There's bound to be a rubbish movie on somewhere.

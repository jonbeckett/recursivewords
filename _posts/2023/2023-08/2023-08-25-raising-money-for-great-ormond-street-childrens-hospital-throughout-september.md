Since doing the "Couch to 5K" in recent months, various charities have reached out to see if I might join them in their various fund-raising efforts. I finally signed up with Great Ormond Street children's hospital last night - a wonderful cause, and somewhat famous in England - J M Barrie donated the rights to "Peter Pan" to the hospital in 1929.

Throughout September I will be running each and every day in pursuit of covering 100 kilometres during the month - using the "Strava" mobile application to track every run.

You will be able to both support and track my progress via the link below:

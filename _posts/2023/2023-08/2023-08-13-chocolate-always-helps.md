After noodling around with the internet for much of the morning, I looked out at the sky, saw that it was cloudy, and thought "if not now, when?". I have a friend in Canada to thank for that phrase echoing around my head during moments of apathy.

I only ran around the block - about three kilometres - but I'm telling myself that "at least you did it". Of course the universe spotted me out running and thought "we're not having that!", and turned the sunshine up to 11 for the entire duration I was out. The moment I got home it went back to being cloudy. The stupid thing? As I finished, I knew I could have run further. Maybe later in the week. Half the reason I ran is because I know Monday and Tuesday are going to be somewhat stressful - I won't have time to do much at all.

We ate lunch late. We had roast dinner. My other half made it, and I cleared up. Somehow she managed to use every pot, pan, tray, and implement in the entire damn kitchen. It was nice though. I always think roast dinner is a lot of effort for very little return - even when I make it (and I wash up as I go). You spent the better part of two hours making something that will take ten minutes to eat - twenty if you're making conversation around the dinner table.

I still think there should be a cook-book that details (a) how long it will take to make something, and (b) how much washing up it generates. I think it would become the biggest selling cookbook in recorded history.

After dinner I drank a glass of wine, and now I can't stay awake. I just downed a mug of coffee, and may have to down another. I'm supposed to be online to take part in an online event in an hour. I wonder if chocolate will help?

What am I saying? Chocolate always helps.

The event is to do with the YouTube channel. Since the channel started attracting the attention of a wider audience I've had to grow a much thicker skin. It's not always easy to ignore somebody picking to pieces every little detail of something you've done - but you have to. If you react, that's what they're after - their five minutes in the sun sh*tting all over what others have done. If you investigate, you quickly discover the most vocal critics contribute nothing of their own invention to any online communities.

It's the old "choose the wolf you feed" story, isn't it.

I choose to feed the wolves that fail in public, get back up, and go again while laughing at their own lack of talent. Self deprecation seems to be something of a required ingredient to take part in anything even vaguely "social" on the hell-stew internet.

I might have to go and buy some chocolate.

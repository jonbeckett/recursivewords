I'm not entirely sure what Wordpress are up to, but they have badly broken the session programming behind their wonderfully dysfunctional platform once again. We've been here before.

At the moment if I visit the public-facing side of anybody's wordpress blog, it doesn't know I'm logged in. If I visit wordpress.com, I *am* logged in. This means the only way I can like and comment is through the "Reader" interface.

I've had enough.

Yes, I know some people love the Reader interface - but that's not the point. It should *just work*.

You remember the fit that Mark Zuckerberg had in The Social Network, when there was a risk the early version of "The Facebook" might go down? I'm of the same mindset - if something is there, for people to use, it should be bomb-proof. Stable. Solid. Dependable. Predictable.

Wordpress has never been, and I've had it with it.

The even more annoying thing? I paid for a domain name and hosting with them a few weeks ago - thankfully not "premium", but still. Annoying.

I'm retreating to Substack. They're doing a LOT of things right, and iterating their platform remarkably quickly - improving it, polishing it, and making it work for writers.

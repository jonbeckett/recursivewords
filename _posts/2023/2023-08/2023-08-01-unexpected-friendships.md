Some time ago I wrote about the curious paradox of feeling loneliness when surrounded by others. I wonder if it's to do with fitting in - or rather, not fitting in. I often walk to my own drum-beat - invested in my own interests, thoughts, and daydreams - and don't typically share them with many.

I can be in the busiest room - in the middle of countless conversations, stories and laughter - and feel largely invisible. It's almost like pulling on a suit of clothes - to be the person that you think others want you to be - and for the most part nobody has a clue.

Perhaps we all do it to an extent - the great charade - the great pretence.

Sometimes though - sometimes we are seen.

Sometimes somebody gets to know us well enough that they see through the facade - to the person pedalling twice as hard as those nearby in order to appear friendly, and somewhat approachable. Hoping perhaps to be noticed - to be liked.

And then sometimes - very rarely - somebody comes completely out of left field.

A chance crossing of paths.

They see you on-sight - straight past the facade - straight past the act. A lightning strike. A landing of Mjolnir. When the dust settles the world is a little smaller, less intimidating, and more friendly. 

You unload on each other - somehow realising the rarity of the situation you find yourselves in. You unload - sharing your story, your ideas, your joys, your sadnesses, and the most mundane moments of the day.

And yet you've never met - you'll likely never meet.

You are nothing more than characters on a screen, or perhaps a photo on a social platform. In a reversal of the world we know, your minds meet first. And yet you somehow know the bridges you build will stand the test of time.

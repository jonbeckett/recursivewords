I'm contemplating ditching Wordpress. A fundamental given of any web platform is that anything a visitor can interact with should perform the expected action.

Over the last few months I've noticed situations where the "like" icon on comments doesn't respond to being clicked, the public facing comment form doesn't reflect my "logged in" status, and now several people have told me their recent comments are nowhere to be seen.

Has anybody else seen similar behaviour from Wordpress recently?

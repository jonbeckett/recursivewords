Here we are again.

I started writing at lunchtime - it's now nearly midnight. I'm sitting in the dark of the junk room on my own - I think the rest of the family have already gone to bed.

One thing after another has either distracted or diverted me all day. Work and home have been ever-so-slightly crazy recently - hence my absence. Hopefully things will calm down in a few days time.

The back-to-back Christmas parties happen this coming weekend. I still can't make my mind up if it's going to be fun or terrifying.

I guess the major news this week is that I caved and bought a "Ring" doorbell for the house - mostly for our eldest daughter. She suffers with anxiety, so being able to see who is outside is huge for her. The crazy thing? We can now see who is either approaching or leaving the house from our phones. It's a bit mad really.

I also did away with the paper calendar and sticky notes in the kitchen - we now have an "Echo Show" that scrolls through our various digital calendars, and tells us what's going on each day when we wander into the kitchen.

All we need to do now is take a TON of stuff to the dump.

Anyway - it's getting late. Time to collapse into bed.

I promise to write something a bit more insightful and/or interesting soon. Just recently life has been dominated by work, and I try not to write about that - for all sorts of reasons.

What's the old saying? Too much work and not enough play make Jonathan a dull boy? Wasn't that what appeared on the typewriter in the "The Shining" ?

I really am going to bed now.

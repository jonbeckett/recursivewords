We left Braithwaite in unexpected sunshine this morning, and set off on the gentle climb along Stile End and Outerside, towards the disused mine at Coledale.

The mine at Coledale was active from the mid 1800s through to the 1990s - and is unfortunately polluting local streams with the ores and minerals that were once sought after. A university project seeks to redress the damage, using a succession of organic pools to filter anything harmful through natural means.

My walking boots made quiet noises all day - although I waxed them last night, I forgot to wax the tongues. I still haven't done it - I imagine they will continue to annoy me tomorrow.

While crossing the hills we passed a number of people walking with dogs - all happy to see us (the dogs, not the people), with exchanges of "hello" as we passed (the people, not the dogs). One particular muddy terrier seemed like he might be living his best life - trying his best to hold an exciteable conversation with us while his owner laughed an apologised.

Today was a good day. The weather was unexpectedly wonderful - not what the forecast had predicted at all. We have no doubts it will have it's revenge tomorrow, or the day after.

We finished the walk back at Braithwaite, and visited the local shop and cafe. Their tomato and pepper soup was the perfect reward for a few hours on the windswept hills.

Tonight we visit the local pub. I should really go and find my coat and shoes, before everybody starts to flap about getting ready.

p.s. it's bonfire night. Look it up if you're not from the UK. I've never quite worked out if we're celebrating that the gunpowder plotters were caught before they blew up the government, or if they almost succeeded...

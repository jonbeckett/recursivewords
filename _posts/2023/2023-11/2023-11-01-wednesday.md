The last few days have been ever-so-slightly stressful - or rather, our youngest daughter has been learning the hard way about just how manipulative, nasty, and two-faced people can be. Thankfully she's pretty level headed, but I imagine it's still hurtful and confusing to continually find yourself in the middle of other people's mayhem. Add to that a large helping of unwanted attention from predatory boys at college, and she's just about had enough this week.

Red flags have been raised at college. Worlds are falling on students heads at her previous school.

It's all tremendously depressing really - knowing that all it takes for teenagers to make horrific choices is for others to look the other way.

In other news we didn't eat until late this evening. There's supposed to be a deal with our younger daughters - that they cook on rugby practice night. They didn't start in time - sometimes I wonder if they've ever seen a clock. I finished making chicken curry while they were at rugby practice, and put together a new storage unit for our youngest's bedroom to lift her spirits on her return (it worked).

What else has been going on?

Oh - you might remember I bought an old computer a little while ago - a refurbished PC. After tinkering with Windows 98 on it for the last several weeks I finally threw the towell in and installed Windows XP on it. It's interesting to look back, and realise just how close modern operating systems still are to XP. It got a LOT of things right.

The YouTube channel continues to cause the burning of midnight oil. I fell into bed at 1:30am this morning after broadcasting a live-stream. Just before heading to bed an email arrived from a marketing company - offering me an unimaginably expensive virtual reality headset to try out.

We'll see where that goes, I suppose.

Oh... I've gone back to using Notion over a bullet journal. I just have to remind myself not to tinker with it too much. If you've never seen it, Notion is the direct descendent of databases, spreadsheets, and note-taking apps like Evernote. It takes a little while to get your head around it, but it's kind of invaluable once you do. And it's free.

I'm waffling, aren't I.

Perhaps it's time to post this, shut the computer down, and go read a book in bed.

Oh - one more thing - we're off to the Lake District at the weekend for a few days - leaving the kids to fend for themselves. We're giving them a grocery budget, and leaving the cupboards empty on purpose. Let the arguments begin :)

We're heading towards the final half-hour of the working day, and I'm not entirely sure how I'm staying awake. After going "out out" last night - on a work night - I then stayed up until 2am when we got home - fooling around with the YouTube channel.

The night out was unexpectedly wonderful. I swear I'm getting worse at setting foot outside the door, but once out I was fine. I know more than one close friend would raise an eyebrow at that admission.

We went on an organised magical mystery tour of restaurants around the town - with each course of the meal being at a different location. The restaurants were kept secret until we arrived at each one - walking around the town in co-horts of perhaps 30 people.

It was fun. And we drank far too much.

Our final destination was a famous restaurant on the edge of town - on the bank of the River Thames. We found ourselves on a huge round table with people we had never met before - but soon tore any walls down and filled the final hour of the evening with stories, laughter, and new friendships. One lady in particular - somebody of note I think - remarked that our table had been the best of the entire evening.

After wandering home slightly the worse for wear, I drank a gallon of coffee and sat down in front of the computer. Some time critical content had to go out on YouTube - if I missed the window, I would miss out on a huge amount of traction for the channel. I'm starting to understand how the machinery of the social internet works.

I finally fell into bed at 2am - and then woke this morning to stratospheric numbers in the overnight analytics. It was worth it.

I feel like hell though.

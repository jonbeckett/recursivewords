After a long and somewhat idiotic search over the last several years, I appear to have found a half-decent text editor for writing purposes that doesn't annoy me too much. It's called "Jotterpad". I'll let you look it up yourself, rather than go on endlessly about it. The world has enough mansplaining niche interest evangelists in it already.

I've always preferred writing in text editors. As whizzy and clever as word processors are with all of their gadgets, widgets, toys, and doo-dads, they always end up annoying the heck out of me. I'm never happier than when sitting in front of a dark screen with a blinking cursor.

Anyway.

It's the Thursday before Easter, and I'm watching the final hour of the day tick down. We just had an enormous hailstorm pass overhead - bouncing pea-sized hail off everything in sight. The flat roof sounded pretty spectacular - like Animal from the Muppet Show had invited all of his friends round for an impromptu jam session.

My eldest daughter stood in the kitchen watching the mayhem unfold with a little bit too much enthusiasm. The prospect of the world coming to an end was apparently very exciting indeed.

I might have laughed a bit too much when she uttered C3PO's famous line:

"We're done for."

Let's hope an extinction event meteor strike doesn't happen during her lifetime - she won't be able to contain herself at all.

While all of this was happening my younger daughters were preparing to depart for Wembley Stadium - to watch the England women's team play against Brazil tonight. I'm staying here - making dinner for myself and our eldest from leftovers. I've promised not to watch the match - I have a terrible knack of causing whoever I'm rooting for to do really badly if I watch them on television.

Right.

Fifteen minutes to wind up anything that needs doing before logging off for a few days.

p.s. I didn't leave my desk all day again (well - apart from trips to the kitchen to make coffee, which turned into emptying the dishwasher, filling the washing machine, folding clothes, washing up, tidying up, and so on, and so forth...

It never ends.

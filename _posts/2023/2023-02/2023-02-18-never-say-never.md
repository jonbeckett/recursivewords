Towards the end of last year I retreated somewhat from the wider social internet - untangling myself from the likes of Twitter, Tumblr, Wordpress, and Instagram. During the hiatus, I explored some of the increasingly popular federated platforms a little, but ultimately kept much of the internet at the end of a very long stick.

I find it all too easy to lose myself in the circular game of posting, reading, liking, commenting, following, and so on - and tend to lose sight of why I am here in the first place.

I love writing.

I've always loved writing, and the internet has provided a straightforward means of sharing my words with the world. It therefore seems somewhat counter-intuitive to exclude myself from the places I have forged friendships in the past.

This morning I have somewhat tentatively re-connected with Wordpress and Tumblr - to share my words within their worlds once more. I'm not entirely sure it's a good idea yet, but it seems like the right thing to do.

Time will tell.

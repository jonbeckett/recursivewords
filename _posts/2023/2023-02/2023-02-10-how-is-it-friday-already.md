Where has this week gone? I'm pretty sure the last time I looked it was still Monday afternoon - and now somehow Friday has lurched into view. Of course right now I'm looking forward to the weekend, but we know the weekend is going to vanish before my eyes, don't we. Before we know it, I'll be staying up late on Sunday night to prevent the arrival of Monday morning.

I still haven't started writing the novel I've been thinking about writing. I need to kick myself up the arse really. If    you see a sudden lack of blog posts, you'll know what's going on.

I'm writing this during my lunch-break from work. I just made quite possibly the most boring sandwich in the world - cheese and salad - at least it tasted good though. I'm often guilty of treating food as fuel - just eating whatever is in front of me and washing up immediately before moving on to the next thing. It might sound like a strange way to be, but it has served me well while the children were growing up.

I'm living in denial of a huge pile of washing behind the upstairs bathroom door - left by our middle daughter. I'm deliberately not picking any of it up - I'm waiting for her to run out of clothes and have a fit about it. She will learn the hard way. Unfortunately I think she's the kind of person that has to learn the hard way again, and again, and again.

Anyway.

I need to step away from the computer for a while, before I go stir crazy.

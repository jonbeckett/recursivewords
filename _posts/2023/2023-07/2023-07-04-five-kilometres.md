I ran at lunchtime today. "Officially" I'm on week 7 of "Couch to 5K". Unofficially, I thought "f*ck it", and ran 5K. I went slowly. It hasn't escaped me that I've lost no weight at all while doing this idiot escapade, and still have problems with my left achilles tendon - but it's not been getting any worse.

I'm not going to lie - it was hard. Getting to the half-way point was pretty straightforward - but the run back towards home from there was a continual mind-game - convincing myself that I would be disgusted with myself if I walked - and if I just kept going, I could say I had done it.

I guess now the challenge moves on to making it easier. If I lose some weight I'll obviously be carrying less weight. That's half the battle. The rest is just making time to run. For fun. No more targets, distances, or whatever. Just me getting off my arse.

Running for half an hour is plenty enough. I obviously don't have the particular brain malfunction that some runners do - to go further, faster, and whatever else. I'm just happy trudging along for a bit. Running a few miles. I know some people are all about clubs, and GPS, and comparing themselves, and so on - I don't really have that in me.

What's the well-worn phrase? Walking to my own beat?

Anyway.

I'm supposed to be working. I promise no posts about running for a while.

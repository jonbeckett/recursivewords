I had the strangest dream last night. I only remember the last few moments. I was at some kind of conference with work, and had made friends with a couple of people during the day. We were all busting to go to the bathroom, and one of the attendees said he knew where the bathrooms were.

Myself, a guy, and a girl followed him through the venue and through a side door. Suddenly we found ourselves in the science labs of a college - picking our way through several hallways and classrooms, before departing onto a street, turning a corner, and letting ourselves in the front door of a show-home on a new housing estate.

There was a trail of excrament across the new carpets - up the stairs, and into the bathroom - which was covered in all manner of unsightly piles of... well - you can guess.

I was at the point of leaving (while pulling all manner of disgusted faces) when a couple of our merry band started to clean up! I found myself torn between staying and helping, and trying to find my way back to the conference hall - and that's when I woke up.

While brushing my teeth the scenes featuring the "Golgotha Shit Demon" from the movie "Dogma" came to mind, and I started giggling. I almost couldn't finish brushing my teeth.

The rest of the day has been something of an anti-climax after that.

I went for a run at lunchtime.

Do you ever set out to do something, and then a few minutes into whatever it is you're doing, you think "I just can't" ?  It looked like it was doing to rain (it still does now), so I pulled on a reflective waterproof before leaving the house - not realising that it would super-heat me while running. I made it half-way around the route before dropping the coat off at home before carrying on. Of course then I really couldn't be bothered with any of it.

Maybe if I run again later in the week it might go a bit better.

I forgot to eat lunch today too. I realised at 4pm and hastily threw together a ham sandwich - mostly because the required ingredients were at the front of the fridge when I opened the door. I really am that basic when it comes to food sometimes.

I just mentioned delivering a jam doughnut to a friend's house later in the week as an excuse to stop work for a few minutes, and now I REALLY want one. I can't remember the last time I ate a jam doughnut. It's probably been years, let alone months.

Anyway.

Perhaps time for a coffee.

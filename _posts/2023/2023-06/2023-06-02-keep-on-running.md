I overslept this morning. I had planned to get up at 7am and get a run in before work. Instead I snuck out at lunchtime and got it done. The funny thing? It's already getting easier. I guess I was right - my legs (and lungs) just needed to remember what the hell they were doing. I suppose it also helps that I don't smoke and don't drink that often.

We'll try to forget last weekend, when I drank as much in one night that I might normally in several weeks. I still don't think my liver has forgiven me.

It's tempting to run further - to push myself - but I know from past experience that I'll just end up taking two steps forward, and three steps back. While doing one of the "brisk walks" in-between running today, a slimmer, fitter, healthier looking guy jogged past. I almost wanted a cartoon grand piano to fall on him.

I'm doing it though. That's something, right?

In other news I discovered I made a mistake in some programming a few months ago - that got all the way through testing and into production. It's easily fixed, but I feel awful about it. There will be a call on Monday morning where I'll have to hold my hands up, explain what I did, and how I can fix it. It's just... urgh.

How does the saying go... "you've let yourself down, you've let your friends down, you've let your family down..." Of course I'm being overly hard on myself, but it's rare for me to make mistakes in programming. I guess the reason it wasn't picked up is because nothing's broken - it's just not doing exactly what it's supposed to be doing - but not in a way that most people would spot until much later (which is exactly what's happened).

Anyway.

I need to try and erase it from my mind and enjoy the weekend. I've already cut the grass (go me!) - I fully expect all manner of other chores to appear from nowhere though and wreck any thoughts of procrastinating famously.

I wonder if any friends would like to go for breakfast tomorrow at the pub? I suppose that's not going to help me lose any weight though, is it. Dammit.

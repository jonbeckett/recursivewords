The first time I woke up this morning I quite confidently looked across at the bedside clock, knowing that I had overslept, and that there would be no way I might make it out in time to go for a run. It was 5:30am. How? Is my body clock really that badly broken?

I promptly fell back asleep, and woke again an hour and a half later when the bedroom was filled with various 80s music. I'm not quite sure what propelled me, but I scraped myself out of bed, pulled on running shorts, and somewhat groggily wandered out into the cold morning air.

The run went well. A day late, but at least I did it. I have to keep telling myself that. There's a huge temptation to run for longer, but I'm purposely resisting it - "following the programme".

After getting home, having a shower, and clearing the kitchen up (which had miraculously trashed itself in my absence), I got over myself and settled in for the meeting to pick apart what went wrong with the work project I sort-of-mentioned over the weekend. The one where a bug slipped through testing and surfaced in production. By lunchtime I had righted the ship, covered it's tracks, and set it's sails for the future. Panic over. I still feel awful about it though.

This evening my other half picked up a new "fire pit" for the back garden. It's not very special - we'll be surprised if it lasts the summer. While they went to fetch it I sawed a colossal quantity of wood in the back garden. Trying to talk my eldest daughter into waiting until it got dark to light it was something of a struggle. I think she just wanted to eat smores.

In other news, tonight is the first in several that I have not been tinkering with YouTube. I'm not sure I've mentioned it recently. The channel I started during the pandemic now has over sixteen thousand subscribers. I'm not quite sure how that's happened. It's like an out-of-control snowball rolling down a hillside. It's fun, I suppose - but you never really think about how much hard work it will become.

Anyway.

It's getting late.

While looking through Instagram earlier I saw a screenshot of a podcast I recorded a long time ago - talking to a blogger I've not seen or heard from for perhaps a year. Isn't it funny how you don't realise how much you've missed somebody until you see their face.

When Tumblr somewhat briefly removed my account a few weeks ago, it brought into focus how important some of the friendships we make online really are - and while we might not cross paths very often, the fact that we can if we wish to somehow makes it ok. When that option is removed, it's kind of awful.

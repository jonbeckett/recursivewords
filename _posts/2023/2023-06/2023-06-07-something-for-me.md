I worked from a nearby cafe this morning with a colleague. It's funny really - so many people seem to aspire to work from cafes or coffee shops, but really it makes no difference. If I'm concentrating on something, I can pretty much block everything out around me - conversations, sounds, music - whatever. I've always been able to do it - much to my family's annoyance. I have the curious ability to re-wind too - to repeat what was just shouted at me, and process it. That annoys them too.

"So you DID hear us!"

I get shouted at a lot.

This evening felt like carrying on with work. My eldest daughter is starting an online business selling jewellery. I dipped into the "bank of Dad" yesterday and ordered her more stock to make jewellery form than she has ever seen in her life - then this evening we went through the machinery of the internet together - making a landing-page website, and aligning a Facebook page, Instagram account, and Etsy shop with it. She now needs to pull her finger out and start making items to be photographed in the sunshine before heading to Canva and starting an internet avalanche of content. I don't think she realises how much hard work it's going to be.

Maybe it's just me.

Maybe my natural position is working at things harder than most? I don't know. Maybe not. I know I do more "stuff" than most people. Every day working from home is interspersed with chores - washing clothes, washing dishes, picking up after others, running errands, and a hundred other things. Because I've been out today and otherwise engaged this evening, I almost fear looking at the dirty washing mountain.

I need to do something that's just for me.

I have no idea what that thing might be - I suppose running counts - but even that has been hijacked by my youngest daughter, who it looks like will be accompanying me on the remaining Couch to 5K runs.

Maybe I should double down on going for a walk at lunchtime. Find a quiet place to write, or read a book. Somewhere outside. There's a bench just outside the house on the green that our house borders. The weather's getting warmer too.

Perhaps that's it. Perhaps a good book, and an hour out of the house - even if it is only a hundred yards away.

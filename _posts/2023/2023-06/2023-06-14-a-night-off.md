After running every other day for the last several weeks, and working out last night too (I'm still sore now), I'm having a night off tonight. I suppose it shows how unfit I had become, because after doing three rounds of basic circuit training last night - squats, push ups, and so on - I could hardly move this morning. I went for a walk at lunchtime purely to make my legs start working again.

It's been a quiet couple of weeks.

When you work from home, each day becomes very much like the last - clearing the decks on a morning, working, washing clothes, folding laundry, clearing the decks in the evening, and so on. Rinse and repeat. Day after day.

The funny thing about not going into town very often is when you do, you remember why you don't go into town very often. Within minutes I was angered, amused, frustrated, and annoyed by those that crossed my path. Of course they had no clue.

Perhaps the most amusing was a pretty young lady sitting outside a coffee shop in the sunshine with her laptop - looking for all the world like she was on a movie set. Perfect hair, perfect summer clothes, perfect floppy hat, enormous sunglasses, and an Apple laptop who's price would make your eyes water. We all know that sitting in bright sunshine doesn't really work with laptops, don't we. She was there to be seen.

I wondered as I walked past if she really *was* trying to be seen. There are several TV productions going on around town at the moment. Film crew trailers, support vehicles, storage containers and so on are hidden all over the industrial estate where I go running.

Anyway.

Just a short blog post today. I'm fine. Fine is such a loaded word though, isn't it. People hear "fine" and think "definitely not fine then" - and while that's partly true, I can't really complain.

I haven't drunk any alcohol for two weeks. I've almost stopped drinking coffee too. I bet if I watch the TV news, hell will have frozen over.

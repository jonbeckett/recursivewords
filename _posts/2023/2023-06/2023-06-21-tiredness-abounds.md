You find me sitting in the dark of the bedroom on my own again - with the Chromebook balanced on my lap, the windows wide open, and the sound of traffic in the far distance.

It's too hot to sleep.

I'm half-way through week 5 of the "Couch to 5K" programme now. I completed another run today - in the really quite ridiculous heat. I suppose it's good in a way to test myself - if I can run in this heat, I should have no problem with longer distances when the weather returns to normal.

I'm completely aware that I'm trying to do too many things at once at the moment - which explains my sporadic absence from friends social feeds, and from life in the real world too. I'm working from home, doing chores, going running, and also continuing to make videos for the Youtube channel. It's never ending. In between all of that I'm playing chess, watching movies with the kids sometimes, and staying up until the early hours to fit more into each day.

I need to slow down. Do less. Make time to read books. Sit in the sunshine.

I might try and work from a nearby cafe tomorrow morning. A change of scenery. What's the old saying? A change is as good as a rest?

A helicopter has just flown past - probably following a car along the main road I can hear in the distance - I imagine it's the police.

Anyway. I'm tired. I should sleep.

We know I'm not going to sleep through, don't we. I'm going to scroll the internet for the next half an hour, and then it will be 1am, and I'll struggle to get up in the morning again.

I really am my own worst enemy sometimes.

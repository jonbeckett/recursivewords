I just got back from giving a friend's dog his dinner, and taking him for a walk around the green outside our houses. He rewarded me by doing the biggest dump he possibly could - because he loves me, obviously.

My daughter came with me. When we let ourselves into the house, the dog looked up at me with a resigned "oh, it's you" expression. When my daughter appeared, he got up, started wagging and walked to her for a fuss.

Maybe there's a metaphor somewhere there about being one of those people that appears in other lives but never stars - a bit part - an extra. I'm going to start looking for myself in famous movies. You know the scene in Pretty Woman where Richard Gere walks in the grass? I bet I'm in the background, carrying groceries home.

In other news, it's been a quiet weekend. We went out for dinner with friends on Friday night, and my other half enjoyed herself a bit too much. She lost the whole of yesterday sleeping it off while I got on with grocery shopping, washing clothes, cleaning the house, and whatever else. Today has been more of the same - I was the only one "up" until after lunchtime.

I finished week 4 of "Couch to 5k" yesterday evening. The heat is still ridiculous - looking outside the window just now, we are forecast thunder and rain storms this evening at some point - with various dire warnings online about a month's worth of rain falling in an hour. I'm on a hair trigger to fetch the washing back in.

While out walking the dog, the sky "felt" heavy. A small aeroplane flew overhead, and I thought "I'd rather not be up in that if the weather turns". You know the old phrase - "the calm before the storm" ? I think we're in it right now.

The birds have stopped singing. Perhaps the birds know what's coming.

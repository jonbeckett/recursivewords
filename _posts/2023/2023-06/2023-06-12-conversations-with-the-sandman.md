Monday became Tuesday nearly an hour ago. I'm still counting it as Monday, while I sit in bed with the laptop perched on my lap. It's hotter than hell up here - not that I have much experience of the temperature in a made up place pushed on people from a re-written book for the last few millennia.

It was hot this morning too. Like a colossal idiot, I went running. If there's one thing I'm good at, it's keeping going at things once I start. The "Couch to 5K" programme moved on to five minute runs today, and I surprised myself. After finding the first couple of runs really hard going, it's getting easier - my body is remembering how to do it. I'm still light-years away from where I once was, but much better than I have been for a little while.

Tomorrow I start doing a "work out" too. It's only basic stuff - squats, press ups, and so on - but it's better than sitting on my backside for hours on end. I need to try and figure out doing stuff in-between working throughout the day.

In the middle of all this sudden activity, I also need to remember to slow down. Spend lunchtimes on the bench outside with a book - or walk to the park in town for a few minutes to reflect and absorb the world around me.

I love people watching. Always have. A park bench is the perfect place to watch humanity pass by. To wonder where people are going, where they are coming from, what their story is.

I also need to remember to say hello to friends - both near and far. I've fallen off the "sociable" wagon just recently - absorbed in a number of projects. One of them is an online shop for my eldest daughter's hand-made jewellery. She started making it some time ago, but has no clue about marketing herself. I created her a website a few days ago - it's on her now to fill it with pretty content.

I think the Sandman may be perched outside the bedroom window - my eyelids are growing increasingly heavy. If this post stops mid sentence, you know what happened...

While sitting in the dark of the junk room decompressing, John Lennon's words come to mind - "life is what happens while you're making other plans". Somehow this weekend came off the rails and never quite got back on them.

Somehow the entire weekend was eaten up with chores and disasters. A monumental quantity of clothes has been washed, dried, folded and put away. A ridiculous quantity of washing up has been done. Repeated rounds of washing up. It's been relentless. And then we had a water leak. We thought we found the cause yesterday, and set about drying carpets out. This evening water started dripping through the lounge ceiling.

An hour later an emergency plumber arrived, and found not one, but three water leaks in the same location. We're crossing our fingers that the rule of three applies here - that things happen in threes. Maybe it's all hoodoo, but it's something to cling to while everything falls apart around you.

In other news, I was supposed to go running today and didn't. I woke up late, the sun shone like a furnace all day, and then the leak happened this evening - pushing dinner back to 8pm. By the time we had eaten and I had washed up (yes, another load through the dishwasher), it was already 9pm. I read online that you're not supposed to run within at least two or three hours of a meal.

Arse.

That's what I think of this weekend.

Why is everything so rubbish at the moment?

Of course it isn't really. There are good things happening too. A close friend I've mentioned in the past - a wonderful writer - had a film she wrote win an award. I'm ridiculously pleased for her. She will of course play it down, and I will of course play it up.

Anyway.

Let's hold on to the happy things, shall we? Let's forget all about chores, leaks, not running, and whatever else.

I went for a run yesterday - for the first time in six months. This will be the umpteenth time I have set out on the "Couch to 5K" programme - to get myself back into some sort of shape. The last time I knuckled down and set about getting off my arse the universe didn't agree with me and gave me COVID. I wonder how long I'll last this time?

I also weighed myself. I surprised myself - I'm not as heavy as I thought. I'm going to draw a ridiculous graph in my bullet journal, and chart my progress - really just to shame myself into staying away from junk food. I'm not going on a ridiculous diet - I'll just eat half-way sensibly for a change.

And maybe not drink myself under the table with friends for a while.

Oh my god I felt crap earlier in the week. I imagine - having recovered from that yesterday - my body realised I was pulling on running shoes yesterday afternoon and thought "hang on - what the hell does he think he's doing?"

The run was pretty straightforward.

I've jumped in at "week 2" of the programme - so it's not too bad yet - just running and walking for a couple of minutes at a time. I'm going to follow the plan and see where it takes me. I know from past experience not to jump in at later weeks - I need my body to remember what the hell it's doing first. I still remember doing Couch to 5K with my daughter a few years ago - meeting up with a running group in town each week. I got bored by about week 5, and went off and ran 5K. I pulled a muscle in the process - because I'm an idiot.

I suppose the end goal will be to get back to running a couple of times a week. One of those runs could be the local park-run I suppose. We'll see.

Anyway.

Why is it that as soon as you think "no more junk food for me", you're immediately hungry ?

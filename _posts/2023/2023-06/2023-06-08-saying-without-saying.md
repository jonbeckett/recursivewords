My personal blog has been using the same "theme" for the past several years. A minimalist stream of posts with no distractions, gadgets, widgets, or whatever else. Just my words, accompanied by a stock photo that is somewhat related to whatever I've emptied my head about.

Now and again I look through the various blog designs and contemplate changing - but invariably return within minutes, hours, or days to the same old design.

Well. Today I *have* changed it. A bit. I've swapped out the sans serif body typeface for serif. Go me, right?

It's funny, isn't it - most people never look at the public face of a blog - they either receive an email, live in Wordpress reader, or use the funky new Jetpack mobile app. It's tempting to tell myself "nobody really cares", but I care.

I'm that guy that used to build things in Minecraft that were buried or hidden - that nobody would ever see.

I saw an old movie recently about an artist working with a muse - after spending much of the movie painting and drawing her, and having long, protracted conversations, he bricked the finished painting into a wall of his studio so nobody would ever see it.

I'm a bit like that, I suppose. There are very few people that really know me - I can count them on one hand. And while the temptation is often there to "empty my head" into the blog - to tell the unfiltered truth - I very rarely do. I sit on the fence - exploring the periphery of what's going on without telling the whole story.

As the Austrian lady I once worked with said - "you say things without saying them".

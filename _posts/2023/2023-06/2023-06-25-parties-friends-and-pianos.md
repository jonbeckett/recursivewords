The clock just ticked past 10am. I've been up for a couple of hours. I'm still the only one up. Pottering around the house - tidying up, putting things away, opening windows and doors, watering plants. The usual.

We went out yesterday evening to a friend's 50th birthday party. It was nice to be on the outside looking in this time - to relax into a party where hardly anybody knew me. I think perhaps the memories I will take with me of the evening were those spent around an open fire in the garden long after the sun went down.

I somehow drew the short straw to get the fire started - and while doing so found myself drawn into all manner of conversations with new friends. Over the next hour or so an eclectic group assembled around the fire - gazing into the flames - sharing stories with one another.

It was kind of wonderful.

There's something about spending time with friends - old and new. I tend to get wrapped up in the next thing I need to get done - and the next thing - and the next thing. I'm also a bit of an introvert - which means getting over myself and pulling on any sort of "talkative, humorous, charming" suit of clothes can be a bit of a struggle. Those that know me tend to lead me on adventures before I get a chance to think too much.

Anyway.

Writing this isn't getting anything done. I need to get off my arse, and enjoy Sunday.

p.s. I might have bought a piano.

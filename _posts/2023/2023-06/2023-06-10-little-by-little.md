I woke up at 5am this morning. I fell out of a dream where I was worrying about running a software development course at a far flung location - but for some reason I had to take several concrete blocks with me. My dreams are spectacularly unhinged at the best of times.

I woke again at 6am, and again a few minutes before 7 - at which point I scraped myself out of bed, pulled on running shorts, and set out to complete week 3 of "Couch to 5K".

The run was fairly uneventful this morning. It struck me during the run that I could probably run a fair bit further already, so it will be interesting to see how next week goes. I can't remember which week it is when the first longer run appears. Let's just hope the weather cools down a bit for that one.

After getting home I spent the next couple of hours doing washing, clearing the kitchen, attempting to tidy the lounge, and getting nowhere fast with any of it. An hour ago I gave up, wandered into the junk room, and here I still am.

I have a feeling we'll all be hiding out in the house this afternoon - the sun is busy trying to cook us alive at the moment. I know these temperatures are very "ho-hum" for the rest of the world, but for us anything warmer than freezing causes us to dissolve into a sweaty heap.

I lost a few pounds this week - just by not eating rubbish. I have a fitness mat arriving in the post today. I'm going to try and do some other exercises on the days inbetween running. I have no idea quite what yet - probably just situps, pressups, and so on. I have a set of resistance bands somewhere - let's see how long it takes me to break them :)

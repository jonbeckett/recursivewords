In a moment of madness this evening I crossed the blogging streams in a manner that Peter Venkman would have been proud. My personal blog has re-surfaced on both Tumblr and Wordpress, after an absence that stretched on for far too long.

I'm not entirely sure if it's a good idea or not, but I've done it anyway.

The challenge now of course is to actually write some words down, and stop tinkering. 

In the real world, the last few days have been ever so slightly mad. I climbed into a transmogrifier before the weekend as a "software and web developer" in a small team, and emerged afterwards as a "senior technical consultant" for a vast organisation.

It's been a learning experience. It's still a learning experience. It's probably going to continue to be a learning experience for quite some time.

And that's all I can really say about any of that. Maybe I can at least share that I now have lovely office space to visit when needed, and will need to buy some half decent clothes to wear when I do.

I'm thinking several sets of identical clothes, so I don't have to think. When I worked in London I had five identical shirts, and two or three identical pairs of trousers that I could rotate throughout the week.

I wonder if Amazon sell shirts?

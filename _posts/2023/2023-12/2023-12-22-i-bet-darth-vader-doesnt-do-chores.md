That's it. No more work until the new year. A few days to relax into the holidays now - to slow down (har har). There is a chore mountain ahead of us - and only a couple of days to complete them.

I had been hoping to go shopping in the morning but fear I may be traveling to and from the rubbish dump and various charity shops all day instead. Or we could just turn an entire room of the house into "Monica's Cupboard" (if you didn't watch Friends, Monica - obsessively tidy - had a cupboard that nobody had seen inside - that was stacked to the ceiling with junk). We're going to need more than a cupboard.

As soon as work finished this evening I shut the computer down, pulled my coat on, and walked into town with my other half to watch Star Wars Episode IV (or just "Star Wars" if you're as old as me) - a "throwback" movie being shown in the new cinema in town.

I feel sorry for the new cinema - or rather, I'm incredibly angry about people in general. We were fifteen minutes later than usual getting into the cinema - because those that had attended the previous movie had trashed the place. Properly trashed the place. It took a small army of staff perhaps half an hour to clean up. When we did take our seats, it was obvious food and drinks had been spilled all over the place - across many of the seats.

While waiting I pre-ordered our drinks and popcorn to take into the screening at the bar (usually you can order from your seat while the adverts roll). A friendly staff member noticed me quietly waiting my turn and tried to take my order. I say "tried" because two women who had already sat down at tables marched up and started berating her. They had apparently been told to take a seat (there are lots of tables in the bar area), and a server would take their order. They presumed I had somehow jumped the queue (there were many staff members taking orders, all over the restaurant), and immediately exploded.

I came *this* close to telling one lady - perhaps early 60s - battleship hairdo - famous label wool coat - to "f*ck off and get a life" to her face after she started swearing at the poor girl trying to take my order.

I just don't get it. Do people not care about anything or anybody else any more? Do they expect the entire universe to revolve around them, and deliver their every whim instantaneously?

Anyway. Deep breaths.

Star Wars was good fun. It was Star Wars - that's all you can really say about that really, isn't it. We grew up with it - we know it backwards and inside-out.

They showed one of the newer versions of the movie - with upgraded special effects, and enhanced sound - but it made it a bit odd really. The difference between the original practical and modern computer generated effects was jarring - especially on the big screen. The sound was odd too - with the original stereo dialog noticeably thinner than the modern sound effects and re-mixed soundtrack. I'm guessing you wouldn't notice any of that at home.

Anyway (second anyway for this post... oh dear).

Time to fall asleep and then try to get up early to do some more chores. When we got in from the cinema the girls had left everything in the kitchen exactly where they dumped it. I got an earful for clearing it up. Here's the thing - I only cleared it up so I won't have to do it in the morning.

I might try and go shopping first thing. Mostly to avoid the arguments and mayhem.

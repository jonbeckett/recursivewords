I finally fell into bed at 2am last night - and then watched a TV show on my laptop until nearly 3am. Perhaps this "trying to fit too much into each day" lark is starting to get a bit out-of-hand?

There's so much I want to do though - television shows I want to watch, books I want to read, programming projects I want to tinker with, writing projects I want to progress, music I want to listen to. Of course everything gets pushed sideways by chores too.

In between everything else I haven't been running for a while either. I need to get on top of that. I've written about my fears of a Jupiter sized backside in the past. We don't want that to happen, do we.

I guess the story of the weekend - in-between everything else - is my return to the Wordpress fold for the written idiocy. While researching web hosting platforms for a friend I finally bit the bullet and started picking apart the new Wordpress design interface - and surprised myself with their new "Design your own site" features. It's not quite Squarespace yet, but it's good enough for most - certainly for me. It costs significantly less than Squarespace too.

Anyway.

Time to go make the third coffee of the morning (so far). Only it's not morning any more, is it. The clock just ticked past mid-day.

Where the hell did the morning go?

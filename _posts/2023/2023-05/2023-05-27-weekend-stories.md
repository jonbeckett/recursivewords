Here we go again.

Somehow it's half past midnight again. Somehow I'm sitting in the dark of the junk room on my own again. Somehow I can't think of anything to write again, but something's making me do this - making my fingers work on the keyboard - making words happen.

Do I really need a subject? A story to tell? Perhaps I do have one though.

I went out today.

I took my daughter to a nearby town and we spent the day together. I promised to take her a few days ago. A trip to the second-hand video game store to pick up a Nintendo DS. She had the idea to help her combat anxiety. Something to absorb herself in when the world becomes too big and frightening for her.

After completing our various shopping errands we grabbed lunch at a pub, and she reminisced about being 9 years old again - making Mario jump, run, and shout as he punched coins and leapt between platforms.

I bought holiday clothes. We're not going away until September, but if I wait the stores will be full of winter clothes, and I'll be walking on the beach in walking boots and a thick coat.

We're going to Tenerife. I don't think I mentioned that before. It's the last big holiday where we're taking the girls with us and paying for everything. They're growing up now - getting jobs - finding their own way - and won't want to be tagging along with us for very much longer. So yeah - Tenerife in the Canary Islands for a week.

When we got home from town my middle daughter had received a parcel in the post. She's been putting money away ever since starting work about a year ago, but never had any thoughts about spending any of it.

She bought a Nintendo Switch.

Of course now she's lording it over her sisters - talking about the games she can play that they cannot. I don't think they actually care that much, but she likes to think they might.

It was lovely to see her unwrapping it in the lounge - having bought it with money she earned. I remember similar moments when I started work, but still lived with my parents - suddenly having money to buy things that would previously have been impossible. It took me a LONG time to get used to having money in the bank. Several years.

We're telling her to enjoy the money she earns before she has too many responsibilities.

On about respobsibilities, I need to lose some weight before we go on holiday. Get fit. That will start with running in the coming days. I have three months to get back into some sort of shape. I need to anyway - for my own piece of mind. Since working from home through the pandemic I've not looked after myself at all. I used to cycle to work every day - several miles in each direction. I used to run several times a week too. I've not done any of that for at least a year.

I wonder how unfit I really am? I wonder how long it will take me to get back to a state I'm happy with? We'll see. If there's one thing I'm good at, it's stubbornly plodding on with the thing I know I should be doing.

Anyway.

It's getting late. I should go sleep. We're going for a walk tomorrow - to Hughenden Manor, I think. Or the valley around it. There's an obelisk - it looks like a Victorian nuclear missile launch site. We've been before.

It will be good to get some fresh air.

After setting aside lunchtime to write a blog post, I've spent the last half an hour doing anything and everything except write a blog post. This is pretty typical behaviour. I'm amazed the distraction only went on for half an hour to be honest - in recent months my hands haven't filled the keyboard with thoughts much before 1am.

Urgh. Where to start?

Life just seems to be such a trudge at the moment. Each day starts with vague thoughts of "what crap's going to happen today?". I've started writing down even the most mundane tasks in my old bullet journal as part of the "working day" - purely because ticking something off feels like I've achieved something. Achieved anything, really.

I've stepped sideways from much of the "social internet" in recent months. I still look in now and again - but quickly grow tired of the typically toxic advertorial highlight reel that many post. Yes, I get it - you like eating out - do you really think that's what people want to know about though? Or is it just me that finds a continual torrent of "look where we are", "look what we bought", or "look how fantastic our perfect life is" gets really, really tiring.

I often remind myself that the internet is not everybody. I'm also fully aware of my paradoxical relationship with it - given I am posting these forgettable thoughts into the torrents of idiocy.

It comes back to the Norah Ephron quote, doesn't it - this blogging escapade - that a blog post doesn't have to say anything. Hello. I'm here. And by the way. On the other hand. Never the less. Did you see?

She called blogging an exhale. I've always liked that thought. An exhale that somebody, somewhere might take notice of. Before they know it they're reading your most recent few posts, reaching out, and a friendship happens. Then months on you know more about each other than most friends or family - and yet you've never met.

I think perhaps that's what I like most about the internet - about blogging - is the serendipity of it all. You never know when you fire up the computer what words you might share, what words you might read, who you might cross paths with, or how important they might become in your life.

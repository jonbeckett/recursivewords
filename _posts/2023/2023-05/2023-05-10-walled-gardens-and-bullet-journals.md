A message from a friend struck home today - encouraging me to stop trying so damn hard. To stop trying to spin so many plates all the time. To stop trying to be everywhere, doing everything, all the time. She was right of course - she invariably is. A whispered voice of reason, arriving at just the right time.

I guess this means retreating somewhat from the walled gardens of the internet, and just "being" for a while. Slowing down. Gathering my thoughts. Disconnecting.

Which leads me rather neatly on to the little paper book on the desk behind me. The bullet journal that I stopped using a couple of months ago - and which I started back-filling to bring it back up-to-date earlier today.

I've been playing with all manner of solutions that don't really work over the last few months - clever software, apps, websites, and what-have-you - that promise a "second brain". I suppose - if I'm honest with myself - I always knew the paper notebook was better. I *wanted* the clever doo-dads to be better than they are.

I think perhaps the failing of all the oh-so-very-clever productivity apps is that at some point you have to start using them - not just dick about with them - and that's when they turn into work instead of fun.

Maybe it's a character trait thing as well. Or a character failing?

Anyway.

For the next little while - maybe for the foreseeable future - I'm going to stop the cross-posting madness, and concentrate a little bit more on me. If you're subscribed over at [substack](https://jonathanwrotethis.substack.com), or already able to whisper straight into my brain via Messenger, or Telegram - those are probably the best ways to reach me.

You never know - I might finally start writing that damn novel.

After a year wandering through the internet wilderness, I've returned to Wordpress, paid for an account, sat down heavily in the corner, and let out a huge sigh.

I'm done trying.

I'm settling for the easiest way out, and the most trustworthy place to just write, post, and not have to think about anything else.

Along the way I've tried out both Medium and Substack. Medium is full of people mansplaining how to make money on Medium (a story that gets old really quickly), and Substack is full of journalists hoping to monetise. I had hoped it might be more.

As you may have read yesterday, Tumblr deleted my account. I'm not sad about losing content - more the friendships and connections I have no way of recovering. I sent out a few private messages on Facebook this morning, but they were a small part of a once huge community.

Anyway.

I've paid for Wordpress - for the next year at least. I've transferred my domain name back. They're busy wiring up certificates and whatever else while I'm writing this - it could take anywhere from a few minutes to a few days. If you're reading this, it's already happened.

In other news, I had something of a nothing day today. I spent the morning doing chores before everybody else got up, the afternoon helping my youngest daughter find her bedroom floor, then cooked dinner, washed up after dinner, and am now up to my eyeballs in this blog re-engineering idiocy.

There's a bottle of prosecco in the fridge with my name on it, but it's already too late to open it. Fizzy wine should be accompanied by friends, stories, and laughter.

Right. I'm going to sign off for the night. If you receive this in an email, you're already subscribed - not need to worry (not that you were worrying, but still...)

I'll shut up now. I'm tired.

Yesterday didn't happen. A few drinks with good friends the night before somehow turned into a take-away meal, many more drinks, and the sharing of stories until the early hours.

When I woke up yesterday it felt like I had been hit by a truck. I really can't drink like that any more (or rather, I can't get away with it). I still don't feel entirely right today, but at least I'm functional.

I need another coffee...

(5 minutes pass while I wander into the kitchen, empty mug in hand)

I have the day off work today. A day to "catch up". The washing machine is on it's second load, the dishwasher has been emptied, the plants watered, the lounge has been tidied (somewhat), numerous boxes that were stacked on the upstairs landing have returned to the attic, and I imagine the vacuum cleaner will come out soon.

It never ends.

There are so many things I would like to be doing, but they tend to get pushed sideways by the things that will keep others off my back. I'm waiting for the garden waste to get collected - after that I can cut the grass in the back garden, and tick it off the list - then I can't be accused of not doing it.

I bought ingredients to make spaghetti bolognese yesterday afternoon, and then got shouted at for buying the wrong things, for the wrong day. I can't win at the moment.

At some point during the next hour my youngest daughter will arrive home from a sleepover (it's half term), and ask about me going out on a bike ride with her. I have no idea where we're going to go. I would much rather go for a run to be honest - I wonder if she'll be up for that instead?

Over the coming weeks and months I've kind of promised to do Couch to 5K with a friend. I need to do *something*. I'm not sure if it's about escaping these four walls, or doing something for *me*. While running is hard while you're doing it, the endorphin rush afterwards is *amazing*. It makes you feel so much better about yourself - and I kind of need that at the moment.

Thankfully I have a few close friends that come out to bat for me from time to time. I hope I can do the same for them, when needed. That's half the trouble though isn't it - the whole Nanny McFee thing - realising when somebody wants you but doesn't need you, or needs you but doesn't want you.

I never realise that I need close friends until after they have arrived with hugs and smiles. It's only afterwards the penny drops and I realise how lucky I am to have them.

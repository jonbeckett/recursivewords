While sorting through old photo albums at the weekend, a big red album titled "This is Your Life" was re-discovered. My other half compiled it for my 30th birthday - twenty years ago now - and it has somehow survived hidden away in a dark corner of the book-case.

While flicking through the pages of the album, a small paper booklet fell onto the floor - titled "School Report". I looked through it with my eldest daughter this lunchtime. She laughed a little bit more than she should have.

Enjoy:

Mr Maskery, Physical Education

It's amusing looking back. This series of reports - from the spring of 1987 - coincides with computers entering my life. I remember getting into trouble with the English teachers (who's report is strangely absent) for "mailing it in" for the first half of the year - and having to sit with one of them and explain myself.

There's also no art teacher report. I'm not sure why. Perhaps the year was broken into blocks in the run-up to choosing exam subjects? Art was the one subject I never had to try at - I could always just do it, and got good reports with no effort whatsoever.

Anyway.

Thought you might like to see these. I think it helped make my eldest realise that nobody is good at everything (apart from my other half, who get top marks across the board). I think perhaps I was guilty of doing "just enough" throughout school.

Returning to Wordpress and resurrecting my old domain name feels like pulling on a set of comfortable old clothes. It's very strange.

Over the days and weeks ahead I'll try to empty my head into the keyboard a little more often. Tell stories. Share thoughts.

It's funny really - so many people have a niche, or a subject, or a target audience. I have never done that - I've always just written whatever came to mind while typing. I'm doing it right now.

I think it helps me, in a strange sort of way - this head emptying. It helps to organise my thoughts. To rationalise. It takes the edge off concerns, dulls the barbs, and flattens the bumps that life throws at me.

It's somehow 1:30am already. I should be in bed. Instead I'm here - quietly tapping away at the keyboard in the dark.

The words only seem to arrive after midnight at the moment. I wonder why that is?

Itas 1:30am and Iave been the last person awake in the house for over an hour. Iam turning something over and over in my head. Not something I can share. Just something.

Iave been humming the Beatles song aA Day in the Lifea for the last few minutes. Maybe itas connected. I donat know how it un-corked itself, but it did.

Isnat it odd how music takes on new meanings when events unfold - when youare deep in the well thinking about things late at night you make new connections - new insights. Suddenly the words in a verse of the song youave not heard for years describe what youare in the middle of more perfectly than you could possibly predict.

Is it coincidence, or were the words waiting there all along?

Perhaps the universe is up to itas old tricks - reminding me that I canat put my head in the sand forever. I canat keep trudging on regardless. Sometimes I need to be brave - to make choices.

Life is kind of like a achoose your own adventurea book sometimes, isnat it - except you donat get to go back a page, and you really never know whatas coming.

It's 1:30am and I've been the last person awake in the house for over an hour. I'm turning something over and over in my head. Not something I can share. Just something.

I've been humming the Beatles song "A Day in the Life" for the last few minutes. Maybe it's connected. I don't know how it un-corked itself, but it did.

Isn't it odd how music takes on new meanings when events unfold - when you're deep in the well thinking about things late at night you make new connections - new insights. Suddenly the words in a verse of the song you've not heard for years describe what you're in the middle of more perfectly than you could possibly predict.

Is it coincidence, or were the words waiting there all along?

Perhaps the universe is up to it's old tricks - reminding me that I can't put my head in the sand forever. I can't keep trudging on regardless. Sometimes I need to be brave - to make choices.

Life is kind of like a "choose your own adventure" book sometimes, isn't it - except you don't get to go back a page, and you really never know what's coming.

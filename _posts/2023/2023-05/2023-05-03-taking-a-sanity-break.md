I planned to write a blog post yesterday. I don't know why I plan anything any more - suffice to say, the blog post didn't happen.

I'm trying to juggle too many things at the moment. I think perhaps the word to take notice of is "trying". I shouldn't try to do as much. Invariably I end up chasing my own tail in pursuit of other people's expectations - which nobody will ever thank you for.

It's interesting how we judge ourselves based on the presumed expectations of others, isn't it.

I worked from a cafe this morning - the one where my eldest daughter worked, and where my middle daughter now works. She threw in her job at the pub - fed up with being taken advantage of by everybody around her, and walked straight into the new job.

It took two attempts to leave for the cafe. The first attempt took three times longer than I thought, on account of the growing OCD within me that cannot leave the house in a ramshackle state. Then after walking perhaps 100 yards towards the cafe, I realised I had forgotten my wallet. Yes, my phone can do payments - but it's sod's law that the day I don't have my wallet, my phone will stop cooperating. I'm pretty sure they're designed that way.

I got there in the end.

You don't realise how loud the ambient noise is in a cafe until you try to join a conference call. I need to get some noise cancelling headphones. Also - best not turn your laptop around to show the cafe to everyone on the call - everybody in the cafe then looks at the faces peering from your laptop, wondering what the hell you're doing. You don't need to know why I know that - it's not important.

Given the effort required in transporting myself to somewhere else for a few hours, I'm not entirely sure it's worth it unless meeting up with somebody. All I really achieved was adding more hassle to an already chaotic day.

Anyway.

The afternoon has been... non-stop. I'm stopping for a few minutes to empty these words into the keyboard to maintain some sort of sanity really. Everything seems to be non-stop at the moment, and yet I know it's really not. A lot of the non-stop stuff is of my own doing. My own idiocy. My own attempts to be everybody, do everything, and be everywhere. I'm not good at it.

I need to slow down, and reach out to a few friends now and again.

I just need to get these bits and pieces done first though...

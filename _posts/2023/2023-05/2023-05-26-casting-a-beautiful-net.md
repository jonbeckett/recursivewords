Many moons ago I watched a television series called "The OA". Without ruining it any more than I might (it's a wonderful series, and you should definitely binge-watch it if you have not), I'm going to share a quote from it:

I often feel the same way about the internet - about putting my thoughts "out there" for anybody to find.

There's always a fear of sharing - particularly sharing the truth - that it will be accepted without prejudice or malice. It seems somewhat counter-intuitive - sharing fear, trepidation, and uncertainty. Something tells me however that the more truthful a story, the more relateable and engaging it becomes - and the more sympathetic the audience.

Perhaps optimism is the key?

I've always been an optimist of sorts - preferring to look forwards rather than back. Where some might endlessly pick apart what might have been, I'm more about where we are, and where we might go next. Perhaps it's an avoidance tactic?

I'm an amazing procrastinator. I've never connected it before. Procrastination is just avoidance in a different suit of clothes.

Anyway.

As you might have guessed, I'm procrastinating my way through lunchtime writing this. Avoiding responsibilities, and the world at large. Sometimes the world get a bit too big. In here I can make it small.

We went to Wembley Stadium this weekend to watch the Womenas FA Cup Final - between Chelsea and Manchester United. Thankfully our youngest daughteras team won - smiles all the way home.

Apparently the attendance broke the world record for a womenas domestic football match - the stadium was almost filled to capacity - 74,000 - mostly entire families as far as we could see. Quite the difference from mens games we have studiously avoided over the years.

Change is happening though. Manchester United have arrived in the top flight of womenas football, and their crowd were the only real downer of the entire weekend. Weave taken the kids to numerous events over the years - several FA Cup Finals, the World Cup, and even the European Cup Final. Weave never seen so much hate, booing, swearing, and abuse from a crowd before. It was awful.

After the game we found a bar to waste an hour before attempting to get home. The rail unions had picked the weekend (on purpose) to go on strike. I wonder if unions realise how much animosity they cause in the general population when they purposely set out to ruin events that many families will have spent many months scrimping and saving for?

Shortly after arriving home my other half arrived in the junk room filled with panic - with seven weeks to go until our summer holiday abroad - our first in four years, she discovered the younger childrenas passports had expired.

Twenty four hours later, and we have re-booked the holiday - delaying it by two months. Two months to renew a passport, you ask? Why yes - because the union at the passport office went on strike for five weeks, and caused the biggest backlog seen in many, many years.

We almost thought we had lost half the cost of the holiday. My other half rang the booking agency, who said we would only receive 50% back on cancellation. She tearfully cancelled the booking online, and received back a credit-note for the full amount.

We didnat believe it until we had re-booked.

At least now we know weare not going to be doing a acredit card holidaya. I hate owing money to anybody for anything. Weave spent so many years stumbling along at zero in the bank, itas become a fear of sorts.

In the morning I need to cancel my leave in July, and re-book it for September.

I might need a drink tonight.

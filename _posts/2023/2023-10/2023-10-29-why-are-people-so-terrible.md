We went to our wonderful new local cinema this evening to watch Beetlejuice (they show a throw-back movie each week). While watching the movie, I couldn't help thinking of the old saying "be careful what you wish for". I hadn't seen Beetlejuice since it first came out - and it hasn't aged well. While it was enjoyable enough, it made me appreciate just how good film-making has become, and how much the world has changed.

The cinema was great. The cinema staff were wonderful. Unfortunately a minority of the fellow cinema-goers seemed intent on either ruining everybody else's night, or perhaps needed everybody else to witness their complete and utter disregard for them.

Who uses the torch on their phone to see what they are eating, drinking, or ordering? Really? Who?

When the lights came up at the end of the movie, the same group - of smartly dressed middle-aged people - appeared to have treated the cinema as their personal rubbish bin. The floor was strewn with food, popcorn, plates, and glasses. It honestly looked like the aftermath of a fight. It made us embarrassed and ashamed - that the staff would have to deal with it - and that people could behave like that, or treat anywhere or anybody with such disregard.

What is wrong with people?

Afterwards we wandered along the high-street to a pub that has been renovated recently and had a quiet drink and something to eat. We were shocked at how quiet the pub was - the entire town really. We saw one other couple looking in an estate-agent window, and there were perhaps two tables in the pub where people were either having a drink or eating.

The couple looking in the estate-agent window made us giggle as we walked past - "SEVEN THOUSAND A MONTH RENT!"... I sometimes forget that we live in a world that contains "other worlds". There obviously exists a world where people can afford houses that cost several million - or even purchase them in addition to their existing homes, and rent them out to people that can afford many thousands each month for rent. I don't know anybody in those worlds, but they must exist - otherwise the advertisements wouldn't exist.

I wonder if it would be fun, or lonely to have that much money. You would find out who your real friends are really damn fast. Wouldn't it be wonderful though - to use the money for good - to help those that need it. No big gestures - just lots of small ones. A helping hand here and there - with no need for acclaim or attribution - to just quietly help those that are already trying hard but not getting anywhere fast. I don't think I would help with ideas or wishes. I would help with levelling playing fields - re-dressing balances.

Anyway.

Time is getting on. Sunday will become Monday in an hour or so. This is usually where the Internet steps forwards, and inquires if I have seen a particular article about a particular subject, and before I know it, it's 2am. Again.

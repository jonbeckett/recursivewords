We went out for a drink and something to eat with friends last night. Not really "out out" - just ten-pin-bowling, and Wagamama (a noodle bar, if they don't have them in your part of the world). It was nice. A break from everything for a few hours. We were all pretty terrible at bowling - I think the last time I set foot in or on a bowling alley was probably six years ago.

I wouldn't call what I was doing "bowling" really - more "bunging". Flinging the ball in the general direction of the pins and hoping for the best. I didn't even stick to the same ball each time - it didn't seem to make much difference.

The food was basic, hearty, and kind of wonderful. After choosing a bowl of ramen noodles, vegetables and meat, I spotted something on the menu called "Bang Bang Cauliflower" and couldn't resist trying it out. After much discussion around the table we couldn't decide if it was going to be explosive or an aphrodisiac.

The "Bang Bang Cauliflower" arrived very quickly, along with some squid balls (which also generated a similarly ridiculous conversation), so we shared them around. "Bang Bang Cauliflower" might more appropriately have been called "Volcano Cauliflower" - but perhaps not a very fierce volcano - more a well mannered but quite opinionated volcano. The squid balls on the other hand were heavenly - I was going to write "heaven in your mouth", but that's probably pushing the adolescent humour just a bit too far.

Before we knew it, we were home again and gazing at the clock in wonder. It was still relatively early - or early if you're used to looking up at the clock, realising it's somehow 2am, and thinking "oh crap - I've done it again". I blame the internet for almost all of my accidental all-nighters.

In other news, I realised yesterday that my legs have stopped hurting. It's been nearly a month since my last run. I'm wondering how much fitness I might have lost. Perhaps I'll sneak out one morning soon - while nobody is watching - and find out. Perhaps I won't go running 100 kilometres again though, hey - my body got pretty angry with me last time.

I really miss the early mornings - they are one of the best parts about running for me. While it's difficult scraping myself out of bed, when I get home I feel a lot better about myself. Maybe it's not "early" that I like - maybe it's being out when nobody else is - being able to run along the high-street without dodging thoughtless idiots, or approaching road junctions without non-player characters launching themselves into my path.

Maybe - if my legs don't fall to pieces at the suggestion of going faster than walking - I'll make a return to park run. Maybe.

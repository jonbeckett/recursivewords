How on earth has October arrived already? Everything about the world feels strange at the moment - disconnected - broken - stumbling in a haphazard manner from one day to the next. Maybe it's the changing of the seasons. Apparently Autumn started a week ago - maybe that's it.

Perhaps this is the "in-between" - the place we all drift through from time to time. Drifting. Unsure.

It's unsettling.

Perhaps I should try to enjoy the quiet time - before I'm surrounded by expectation and obligation again. A chance to reflect.

This morning I pulled my old bullet journal off the shelf and started updating it - bringing it in-line with my work and home calendars - back-filling the days of recent weeks. I've been experimenting with various online solutions, but invariably return to a paper notebook - there's something about anchoring thoughts when you write them down that doesn't happen when you type them into a computer.

Anyway. Maybe it's time for another coffee - and something to eat - it's almost lunchtime.

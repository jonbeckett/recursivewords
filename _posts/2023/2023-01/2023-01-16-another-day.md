It's been a day. Another day. There have been too many recently. I signed myself off work at lunchtime, but within an hour had been thrown head-long into a request from a client. I didn't finish until the rest of the family called me for dinner. The fourth day in a row this has happened.

During the dark days I tell anybody that asks that I no longer enjoy what I do. On the brighter days, the opposite.

My world is often circular - a repeating pattern of highs and lows - sunshine and darkness. In the middle of it all, I seek out those I might escape with from time to time. The friends that somehow pick their moment to say "hello, how are you, it's been far too long".

The universe is usually good at that - providing those we need at the moment we need them. Not always though. When the quiet comes, the silence is deafening.

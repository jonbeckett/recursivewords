After deteriorating through much of the day before, I called in sick yesterday - the first time I have called in sick in about eighteen months.

Of course this is me though - at lunchtime I checked my work email "just in case", and within minutes had started my work laptop and ended up working straight through the afternoon. I finished a little before my other half returned from work, and went straight to bed.

I woke up this morning having burned up pretty spectacularly in my sleep. When I went to bed I had been shivering uncontrollably, and then throughout the night turned the bed into some sort of furnace. I presume whatever it was had gone full-circle during the night. I still feel like a truck ran over me today - but at least I'm not sitting here sweating or shivering.

Fun times.

The rest of the house have been sick throughout new year - catching one thing after another off each other. I seemed to avoid most of it, so should be thankful I suppose.

In other news, the new bullet journal arrived. The one I definitely wasn't going to buy, because I was going to try to use the computer this year. Yeah. That lasted a long time. Old habits die hard, I guess.

Oh - almost forgot - the replacement tablet that wasn't supposed to arrive until March unexpectedly arrived this week too. I've installed it and set it up, but not done anything else with it yet. It's very lovely. I took it up with me last night to watch a rubbish movie in bed, but felt that dreadful I didn't even switch it on.

Now if you'll excuse me, I have a date with the kettle, and yet another cup of red bush tea. I might even make it to the corner shop in a minute - to buy some chocolate and energy drinks. If I load my body with sugars, it can use them as fuel to fight the gremlins waging war against it, right? It sounds like a good excuse to me.

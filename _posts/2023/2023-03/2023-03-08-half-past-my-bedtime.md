Just a few words, given that I haven't posted since returning from Amsterdam.

I picked up a bug somewhere along the way - and have been suffering quite a bit over the last 72 hours or so. It's just a cold, but it's really put the boot in. No sense of taste, head full of cotton wool, coughing up lumps of horrible stuff. I'm slowly on the mend though.

Tonight I've been practicing Russell Crowe impersonations. Father of a murdered son, husband of a murdered wife - you know the lines.

Of course work has been crazy since my return. Various small corners of quite important websites have begun to appear online (and that's all you'll get out of me about it) - and I have the quiet satisfaction of knowing "I did that".

Anyway.

It's already 1am. I seem rather too good at staying up late to avoid tomorrow.

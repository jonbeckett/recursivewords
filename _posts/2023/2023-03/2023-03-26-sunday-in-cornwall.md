If youave not been reading in recent days, Iam in the south-west of England at the moment a visiting my parents for a long weekend.

You may recall I wrote about getting involved in aflight simulationa during the pandemic a pretending to fly all manner of aircraft all over the world within the imaginary world of the internet and sharing my exploits online. Thatas why Iam really here. My Dad is a member of a club a that come together once a month to share their imaginary aviation exploits a and I had never met anybody else in the areal worlda engaged in the same hobby. That changed today.

It was kind of lovely a although also awkward. While Iall never be happy abeing the centre of attentiona, it was wonderful to be reminded that so many kind, approachable, talkative, and welcoming people still exist in the areal worlda. After spending so long (three years?) communicating both professionally and personally through the internet, being able to shake hands, smile, and laugh at each otheras stories was kind of wonderful.

My Mum has regressed twenty years. While I write this she is busy making roast dinner, and refusing all requests to help. She will no doubt stack three meals worth of food on my plate, and I will no doubt eat it all rather than face the conversation where she asks whatas wrong with it.

Itas been good though. A few days away. After facing all sorts of professional pressures in recent months, itas been good to hit a reset button of sorts and just abea. Of course I feel guilty leaving my other half behind at home.

I head home tomorrow. Another mammoth train journey across the country.

In the morning Iall walk down to the sea (if the weather allows). Itas about a three mile circular walk to get there and back a down and up a pretty steep hill. A last few moments of sea air, and quiet before returning towards London, noise, responsibility, expectation, and obligation.

My lovely Californian cousin kept me company on the way down a messaging back and forth to distract from a really rather disastrous journey. I wonder if she will step up tomorrow too?

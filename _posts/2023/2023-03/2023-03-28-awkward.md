I just wrote a somewhat awkward agoodbyea message over at Substack, where I had been experimenting with writing personal blog posts for the last several months (not for the first time).

Iam returning to WordPress, but still not quite letting go of Tumblr, because I have too many memories wrapped up in it. Too many echoes of forgotten friendships to quite close the lid on it entirely.

You might not have even noticed I wasnat aherea for the past little while, unless you read my about page, where I confessed my sins. Iam thinking that if I donat try to be everywhere, I might have more of a chance at being somewhere. Hopefully that makes a little bit of sense?

I might choose a different theme for the blog though a itas look and feel. Weall see.

Anyway.

First day back at work today after a few days away. Itas been quiet so far a which is good, I suppose. Lots of coffee has been consumed. Several hot cross buns no longer exist.

Since returning from the coast yesterday evening, in between working Iave been on something of a chore marathon around the house. It doesnat look like Iave achieved very much, but I feel better for having at least tried.

I may have volunteered to make dinner this evening. I forgot all about it until I started writing this. You canat see me sighing, can you.

Today marked the beginning of perhaps a long journey into the unknown - learning something entirely new - or new to me at least.

I've been busy reading documentation all day - and writing pages of notes about an endless list of programming frameworks and libraries that I've never heard of or seen before. The climb ahead is looking pretty vertical at the moment - I'm sure it will get easier.

Before I knew it, the day had gone - the evening has almost gone too. It's funny how that happens.

Quite how I'm still awake is anyone's guess.

I knew my middle daughter was working until midnight in the pub last night, so stayed up to make sure she got home in one piece. Midnight didn't seem like such a big deal - until it became 1:30am. As she approached the front door in the darkness, it magically swung open in front of her and I stepped from the shadows, smiling.

I whispered "hello", and she silently waved her key at me.

We crossed paths minutes later on the upstairs landing - with whispers of "goodnight" before collapsing into bed.

There's a temptation this evening to fall down the internet rabbit hole in search of knowledge - to make tomorrow's continued climb up the vertical cliff a little easier.

I'm resisting - so far.

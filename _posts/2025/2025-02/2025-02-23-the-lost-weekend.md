After signing myself off work sick last Wednesday, I returned to work on Thursday and Friday even though I was quite obviously getting worse. Even missing a day caused so much paperwork that I didn't dare contemplate taking any further time off.

I got markedly worse over the weekend. I think perhaps Saturday night was the low-point. There was a moment in the evening when my sides hurt from coughing, I kept coughing up rubbish, I couldn't get my breath, and had a banging headache - where I started to wonder about taking myself off to hospital.

I didn't in the end.

I spent much of Saturday and Sunday sitting on the sofa watching television - something I *very rarely* do. Whenever friends talk about recent television shows, they take for granted that I won't have seen whatever they're talking about.

I watched two entire seasons of "Silo" - a post apocalpytic thriller - using a free trial of "Apple+". I've now bought the books on my Kindle to find out the rest of the story before they make the third season. The only problem - it looks like the TV series has cherry-picked bits and pieces from six books.

Anyway.

Slowly on the mend now, and more than conscious that I kind of fell off the radar over the last few days.

Looking forward to visiting my parents for a long weekend at the end of next week. I won't tell you how much paperwork that generated, either.

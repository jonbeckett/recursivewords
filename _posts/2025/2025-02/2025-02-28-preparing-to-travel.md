After a week and a half struggling with a cough and cold, I'm finally starting to feel better this morning - or at least if I sit quietly, I don't cough my lungs up. My head still slowly fills with snot though. Too much? Sorry.

It always interests me that when you're properly sick, entire days seem to vanish. Apparently it's been nearly a week since I wrote anything of consequence in the blog, and yet I can't really remember much about the past several days. The majority of the time has vanished into a haze created by ibuprofen and paracetamol.

I hate taking tablets, and it's not without good reason - just sitting here now - dosed up - I don't have a headache, but I can feel the pressure in my head. The "dead of night" sound of blood rushing through my ears is a pretty consistent roar at the moment.

ANYWAY!

We're getting ready to travel to the coast for a few days - made somewhat problematic by my other half forgetting to charge the car all week (we have an electric car). I foresee an enforced stop at a services for an hour along the way to leave it on a fast-charger for a while.

We're travelling light. Warm clothes, walking boots, and not much else. In related news, I just discovered that all of the washbags I have used for the last several years have been thrown away - so that's helpful.

I should go grab some lunch before we leave. We have a long journey ahead.

Hopefully the next few days will afford the chance to sit down and write something a little more consequential for the blog. It's about time.

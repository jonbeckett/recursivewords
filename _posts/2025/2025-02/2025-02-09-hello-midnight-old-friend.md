We went out for breakfast this morning at the caf√© where my middle daughter works (or rather, one of the places she works - she now has two jobs). The owner came over and sat with us for a few minutes - we've known him for years - our children were all at school together. It was good to catch up.

While ordering "eggs benedict" without bacon or ham for my other half - she's vegetarian - I was asked if she might like something else substituted. I shrugged, and an enormous list of options was read to me. I seized on halloumi, because I know she likes it - even though I'm historically terrible at ordering for her.

Thankfully I got it right for once.

I had a very predictable "Full English" - bacon, black pudding, mushrooms, tomatoes, beans, poached eggs, and bubble-and-squeak (fried potatoes and vegetables).

I'm not really sure what happened to the rest of the day. By early evening we found ourselves back in town once more to watch the rugby in Wetherspoons. My daughter was due to start her second shift after the rugby finished, so she accompanied us and I shouted her something to eat and drink.

I'm wondering how long she'll survive doing both jobs.

There's something I'm avoiding writing about, but has been on my mind all day. A distant friend - met through the internet a while ago - has been going through a really tough time.

While a voice on my shoulder tries to tell me that listening is valuable, there's a part of me that wishes I could help in some way.

Anyway.

It's getting late.

Tomorrow we're winding the clock back a decade, and wandering to our local rugby club to stand in the wind and rain cheering on the same girl that will get in from work at perhaps 2am. I'm not quite sure how she's going to do it. We'll see.

I wandered into town to walk home from work with her in the week. I'm not quite sure what I was expecting, but town sure was quiet at 1am on a week-night. I'm pretty sure it will be a different story tonight - Saturday - I guess we'll see about that too.

The clock will tick past 1am in 4 minutes. I'm sitting in bed, in the dark, tapping away on a laptop - running down the last bit of "awake" I have left.

After another morning watching a long-running process on a distant server farm and filling a colossal document with the results of it's progress, I escaped at lunchtime to grab something to eat from the nearby garage.

Late this evening I discovered that while en-route to the garage I had walked straight past one of my closest friends. She said hello. I didn't respond - I just carried on, oblivious.

How bad is that?

I don't think I've ever done that before.

I'm sitting here, wondering if becoming so consumed in whatever you're doing is a good thing or a bad thing. I mean... it's not great, is it. Sure, you're proving that you have ridiculous levels of focus, but at what cost?

There is a kind of dark humor to it really - I managed to completely ignore the one person I would willingly spend any lunchtime with, if given the chance.

Anyway.

It's getting late.

I tried avoiding the arrival of Monday on Sunday night - it didn't go well - it never does. The ball of mud we're all standing on will carry on spinning, and keep delivery tomorrow after tomorrow after tomorrow. It's good at it.

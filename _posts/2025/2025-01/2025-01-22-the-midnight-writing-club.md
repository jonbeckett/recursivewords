Welcome to the inaugural meeting of the "Midnight Writing Club". Unfortunately we only have one member at the moment, so I'll be acting as chair-person, taking the minutes, making the coffee, and putting the cake on plates that I brought with me.

Of course I jest.

Or do I? Perhaps this should be a thing - a gathering of writers in the dead of night to hang out together - perhaps just co-existing in a chat room with one-another while writing a few pages - be it for a blog, a book, or whatever. We could have our own Discord server - shrouded in mystery as all good secret societies should be.

It's something to think about, isn't it.

Anyway.

I've just checked my work calendar - it looks miraculously empty tomorrow - there's a distinct lack of meetings. For the first time in months I'm considering an escape attempt - a few hours at a local caf√© or pub - listening to podcasts while tapping away at my laptop. A change of scenery - a reminder that a world still exists outside of these four walls.

Wish me luck.

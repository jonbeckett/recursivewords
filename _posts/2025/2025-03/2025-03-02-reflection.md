Greetings from deepest, darkest Cornwall, where I'm visiting my parents for the weekend.

After arriving late on Friday evening, we wandered into Looe on Saturday - known from a recently famous television show as "Shipton Abbot". We wandered around the town, half-expecting to walk into the characters from the TV show.

Today - Sunday - we wandered to a Victorian country house a little way away and went for a walk around the house and gardens. They are looked after by the National Trust. We chatted with one of the volunteers on site for some time - reminiscing about visiting with our children years ago.

It's been a good couple of days away. A good break.

I will admit that ever since my parents retired down here I've always preferred to visit when none of the holiday makers are here. I wonder how the local communities get through the winter - it's so quiet. I guess if you're used to a seasonal way of life you budget, and hope to make enough during the season to see you through. It's a very different way of life.

Tonight we're holed up at my parents - catching up on stories, and half-watching television. "Call the Midwife" is on, and silence has descended upon the house. It's funny how some television shows seem to cross generations.

My parents bought me a mug for my birthday - saying "I'm kind of a big deal on Youtube". I can't help thinking of Fin in Star Wars saying as much to Han Solo about him bing "kind of a big deal in the resistence".

I'm self deprecating to a fault, and the worst self-marketer I know.

I hadn't really thought about my birthday until today. Tomorrow I'll be 52. I'm not sure if I feel it or not - or quite how I should feel. I do know that I need to start running again - or walking at least.

Leaving the house would be a start.

It's too easy to become consumed in work, making money, and to forget about friends - and yet I also know that so many of us are struggling - running flat out to keep our head above water - worrying about the future - worrying about the present.

It's hard.

Isn't it interesting how something as simple as an upcoming birthday can cause you to reflect - to refactor. Perhaps this year I will make no grand promises to others --- I'll just promise to myself to keep in touch with those I care most about - my friends - both near and far. How long does it really take to say "hello", "how are you", or "how is your day?".

I know in the past I've often become tired of being the one to reach out. The reality is reaching out is easy. Reading the quite wonderful book about the boy, the fox, the horse and the mole reminded me that asking for help is quite often far more difficult than accepting it. If I might give a friend the opportunity to share a burden, or lighten a load, I'll happily take the chance.

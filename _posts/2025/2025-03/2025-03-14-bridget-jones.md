We just got back from the cinema - after finally seeing the latest (and perhaps final?) Bridget Jones movie. I had heard mixed things about it - some friends loved it, some hated it, some were indifferent.

I loved it, and I can't really put my finger on why.

Yes, it's quite predictable, and yes, the laughs are sometimes forced, but oh my word did it ever rip me a new one emotionally.

Maybe I'm a poor judge. Perhaps that's it though - I try not to judge movies - I'm there for the escape - to see the world through somebody else's eyes - to walk in their shoes for a little while - to laugh and cry with them.

I'm not going to say anything about the story because I don't want to ruin it for anyone. I've had enough of the "Paul from Midnight in Paris" idiots mansplaining the synopsis of books and movies to whoever might listen - dictating what should be felt, what should cause amusement, and what should be considered watchable (or not).

For me the cinema has always been about being there in the moment - or rather being taken somewhere other than here. For me, that's the magic.

Tonight, during a quiet moment in the movie I heard several people around us quietly giggling, and sniffing. I wiped a tear from my own cheek - and smiled.

If it is the last movie, I'm going to miss Bridget.

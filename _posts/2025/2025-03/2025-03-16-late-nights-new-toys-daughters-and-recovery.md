I was going to go to bed at a fairly normal time last night, but then fell down an internet rabbit hole of my own making. Before I knew it, it was 2am, and the first Formula One race of the new season would be broadcast at 4am - from Melbourne, Australia. I wondered about grabbing a couple of hours sleep on the sofa but somehow that didn't happen.

After watching the race I eventually fell into bed at 6am - waking up three hours later. I'm not entirely sure how I'm going to get through the rest of today. I don't seem to be able to get away with surviving on such little sleep any more.

Anyway.

It's been a quiet weekend so far.

In an outrageous fit of extravagance on Friday I spent a little of the hard earned YouTube money on a new gadget for myself - an "Amazon Fire Max 11" (or at least, some combination of those words, but perhaps in a different order). I also got a pen for it - which seems to employ some sort of sorcery to affect writing on the screen. It's tremendously clever, and I understand none of it.

A veritable treasure-trove of procrastination awaits.

The hope is that this little machine can go pretty much everywhere with me, and - who knows - I might even write something of consequence using it (even my eyes are rolling at that one - we all know I'll just tinker with it endlessly, rather than use it for anything even vaguely constructive).

In other news, our eldest appears to have broken up with her boyfriend. I met her in the kitchen in the early hours, after she had been to the pub with her sister. She had her hair cut yesterday, and seemed to have pulled herself up by her boot-straps. Suffice to say I'm ridiculously proud of her for wanting to get on with her life. I imagine there are going to be more bumps in the road ahead, but facing the world down with a new haircut seems like a pretty bloody good first step to me.

After murmured conversations about dropping out of college last week, our youngest daughter has met with her tutors and agreed to continue. We're crossing our fingers and toes that she will carry on. Conversations were had about next year - about an apprenticeship or internship at a company connected to her college. Like I said - fingers and toes firmly crossed - if she carries on I'll be super proud of her too.

Our middle daughter has been knocking it out of the park recently. After working two jobs for the last month, she resigned from the local café and is moving towards working full-time at the huge pub in town - table running, serving behind the bar, and making food in the kitchen too (she showed us her chef uniform this week). Alongside that she's still finding time to visit the gym, and the weight is falling off her. So yes - super proud of her too.

Finally, I'm actually (fingers crossed) starting to feel better too. I'm still not 100%, but I can at least potter around the house doing things without coughing my lungs up. There have been murmurs at home about calling friends to have a belated birthday drink in town at some point - perhaps to coincide with my other half's birthday next week. We'll see.

Right. I better go. There's a cup of coffee and a hot-cross-bun with my name on it in the kitchen.

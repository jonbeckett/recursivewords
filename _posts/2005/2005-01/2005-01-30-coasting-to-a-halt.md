After what seems like a marathon, my CMS project is finally becoming feature complete, and just needs some user interface work before it can leap towards something nearer to a version "1".

I would hate to estimate how many hours have been invested in the project so far, and I don't really know if the project will ever become "successful" financially... all I know at this point in time is that CMS is far more powerful as a "developers system" than any content management system out there.

So... today is Sunday, it's nearly 5pm, and we have no plans at all this evening. Last night we went to visit friends for a chinese takeaway, and basically ate ourselves to a standstill  I wonder what we have in the freezer?

Yesterday I was working on-site and had to transfer some files from my own development FTP site - so needed the passwords. I have all my passwords on a USB keyring drive in an encrypted file - so hopefully nobody can find them out.

I used the key all day with it plugged into the back of a computer, and got lots of work done.

I then realised at about 8pm last night that I didn't have my keys. I thought "where are my keys?", and suddenly realised that they were attached to the USB keyring... which was attached to the back of a computer at the client site.

You can imagine the panic.

Not only have I had to change all my passwords recently anyway (so they are all now random, and different than one another), I'm not going to have access to them for a few days at least. Luckily I opted to allow some of my software at home to store a password (such as my email software and FTP software), which has given me just enough access to things to carry on working on stuff.

It's not fun though.

The whole security thing kicked off one night last week when I realised that somebody had logged into the old version of the CMS system and changed a value somewhere. Within the hour I had gone through every account on the internet that came to mind (that used that password) and changed everything to different (random) passwords.

I guess you need to get bitten like that before you start to take security seriously.

Luckily the newer versions of CMS encrypt the passwords anyway, so it shouldn't be an issue any more.

So... it's Saturday, and for the first time in I don't know how long, we are sat at home doing not much at all. W's hand is slowly getting better, and for once things are pretty quiet. Nowhere to go, and nothing in particular to do.

Might walk into town in a bit and pick up the laptop bag we ordered. Other than that... geeky day in front of the computer maybe

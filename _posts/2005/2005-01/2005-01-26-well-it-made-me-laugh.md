Yes, your eyes are not decieving you - that really is Anna Kournikova in the picture over on the right, and yes, she really did show the cameras everything she has. Okay, so the cameras were probably 500 yards away, and were hidden in trees and stuff, but still... it's a pretty amazing picture.

And now you're wondering how on earth I chanced across the picture... (no, I wasn't looking at naughty websites...)

I had to commute via train to a meeting yesterday, and by chance I sat down at a seat on the train where somebody had left a magazine. I don't remember the exact name of the magazine, but it was a typical "guys" celeb pictures magazine - things like "how big Jennifer Anniston's boobs look this week"...

Anyway - I sit there and start leafing through it, and on page 2 they had the picture I have repeated to the side of this blog entry... it took all of 5 seconds to find it on Google with the search terms "Kournikova Yellow Bikini"...

How stupid is she? And how annoyed must her sponsors be? It really makes you wonder, doesn't it 

So there's Anna, walking up the beach, and she thinks "oh dear, I think I might have some sand in my bikini..." like she didn't realise half the paprazzi for 100 miles around are pointing their cameras at her from 500 yards away...

So there you go - Miss Kournikova shows the world's paprazzi what she had for breakfast  hahaha

It is a pretty damned funny picture. I guess in the grand scheme of things, all publicity is good publicity - especially if you didn't actually turn out to be that good at Tennis after all.

Oh - and if you want to see the uncensored pictures - like I said - 5 seconds with google.

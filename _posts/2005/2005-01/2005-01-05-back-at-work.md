Today is Wednesday, and I am back at work after "missing" a day yesterday. I've had some paracetamol this morning and loads of water, and so far (touch wood), no headache 

Being back in the office is certainly keeping me busy. So far this morning myself and C have worked on a bug for a client (and solved it! woohoo!), so I am now digging into the books to research some development on something else... busy busy busy.

If you're wondering why I never give much detail about the commercial stuff I work on, it's because I'm scared stiff of libel and slander. I could use this blog to bitch about everybody and everything, but I'm not that kind of person anyway. I'm fine writing about what goes on from day to day, but I'm not going to backstab anybody. I might tell funny stories of things that have happened, but that's about the limit 

Ooh! I just spotted a packet of cup-a-soups on my desk - you know - the foul smelling soup mixture you can make in a mug... if I get hungry enough I might crack one open.

I'm not bored, honest.

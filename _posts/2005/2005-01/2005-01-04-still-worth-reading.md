I just had a quick look at the "Clix" chart on Diarist.

Net (www.diarist.net), and was shocked to discover that without any effort on my part, my blog still ranks as a top 20 entry on their list!

I cannot believe that so many people look in on my little blog. It's not like it has any earth shatteringly important news in it. Perhaps people like to read what's going on in the life of a very ordinary person living a very ordinary life.

As I posted this morning, I am off work today with a pretty horrific headache. I had it a couple of days ago and it pretty much knocked me outand returned with a vengeance in the early hours of this morning. I didn't really get much sleep last night because of italthough it seems to be going away now. I've been trying to just drink water and not take tabletsI've had so any neurofen recently I'll start to rattle.

News for this afternoon is that I re-affirmed just how stupid it is to try and play chess when your mind isn't in itI lost my first game to a friend I play regularlylook up "Limboduck" on http://www.redhotpawn.com [http://www.redhotpawn.com/]. The game isn't technically lost yet, but it's looking very much like it will be very soon indeed.

I don't know if I wrote in here before, but I got one of those fancy-dandy USB memory keys for christmasa 64Mb swiss army knife made by Victorinox. Apart from my password file, I'm struggling to think of anything to put on it that's useful at the moment I guess uses will make themselves obvious as they appear!

So there you goI'm going to stop typing now for fear of making my headache worse looking at this laptop screen.

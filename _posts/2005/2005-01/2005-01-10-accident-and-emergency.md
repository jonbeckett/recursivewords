We had something of an eventful weekend.

On Saturday we went out for a long lunch in Henley with friends we hadn't caught up with over christmas. We went to Cafe Uno, and ended up being there for about 3 hours 

On Sunday we were due to have some other friends come to us for lunch, and were getting ready in the morning when W managed to chop the end of her finger off with a mandolin chopping board thing (one of those things for making thin slices of vegetables).

I took one look at what she had done (while trying to stem the blood) and decided immediately to go to casualty at the local hospital.

Three and a half hours later (and several phone calls to delay the meal to the evening) we got home (luckily W was okay), and I set about cooking my first full roast dinner for 5 people 

Luckily our guests arrived a bit early, and everybody shouted instructions of what to do next with the cooking... I can follow instructions 

So - here I sit at work with a slight hangover. I think we must have got through a couple of bottles of wine during the evening - plus a couple of beers each 

Ho hum... roll on lunchtime.

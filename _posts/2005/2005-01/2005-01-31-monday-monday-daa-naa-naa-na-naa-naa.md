It was the Mammas and the Pappas wasn't it? (the title of this entry).

Mama Cass. What a voice. Shame so few people remember them now... There was a girl who sang for the Beautiful South that sounded very much like her too.

Anyway... today is Monday, and I feel... oooh... about 45.5% better than I did last week. Still not "A-OK" as the mercury astronauts might have said, but pretty good.

I have a copy of "Mandrake Linux X86-64" on my desk to put into the monster machine when it arrives... I am finally going to have a Linux development box here in the office... a 3.2Ghz 64bit monster - easily the fastest machine in the office, and bought for less than 500 from Novatech...

I spent a couple of hours yesterday reading an e-book about Linux Administration - kind of a "bootstrap" guide to all the things you really should know about running a system... info on things I had never really fully understood like sudo, symbolic linking, and the more arcane uses of Grep.

All I have to do now is wait for the bits of machine to arrive so I can build it (I ordered the bits because it was cheaper than a ready built machine with a ton of crap I don't want).

Ho hum.

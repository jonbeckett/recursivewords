For what seems like the first time in weeks, we are doing nothing at all today. What a great way to spend a sunday - surfing the web (and discovering Blogclicker in the process, eating nice things, and occaisionally playing on the X-Box.

After getting up late, the morning quickly turned into early afternoon, and I found myself heating up some fresh mushroom soup in the Microwave at 3pm. It was either that or go hungry until this evening - which wouldn't have hurt given that I probably put on half a stone over Christmas.

W is busy playing "TopSpin" on the X-Box as I type this, and I'm wondering what on earth I can get on with given that I can't use FTP because I don't have the password for it (see the earlier post about my leaving my keys - like an idiot - at a client site). "TopSpin" is a tennis game where you get to buy clothes and stuff for your character - so W thinks it's the best thing since sliced bread.

Changing subject, I saw the news last night about the ESA Huygens Probe landing on Titan. Something that did annoy me though was the NASA news reports late last night bending over backwards to try and steal the credit - pointing out who built the rocket, who launched it and so on... it really looked bad. I'm not being "anti-american" - just pissed off with NASA.

Changing subject yet again, I played chess on the internet this morning with "Chessmaster 10th edition" - I got a copy of it cheap the other day in PCWorld. While it was okay, it's not a patch on the Chessbase online chess site, and probably more seriously, there are people cheating on there. In my first game I found myself playing a guy who had a rating of "1" (while everybody else had ratings up around the 1000 mark). It was no surprise that he made absolutely no mistakes, and ended up wiping the floor with me. When I asked him about cheating, he disconnected on me. Hmm... At least Chessbase actively monitor games for cheating.

So there you go. My Sunday so far. I dare say I will write again later if anything at all happens.

It's supposed to be my first day back at work for the new year today, and I'm sat at home with a killer headache, and a snotty nose.

What on earth is going on with me at the moment? On new years day I got a headache at about lunchtime that was so bad it made me physically sick - it even made me lose my balance.

Anyway - here I sit on the couch at home with the radio gently running in the background, waiting for the neurofen to kick in. When it does hopefully the ache behind my right eye will dissappear a bit - although while I'm sat here keeping still it's not too bad... seems to get worse if I move around.

I'll probably write more later.

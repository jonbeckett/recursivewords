I just wandered into the lounge after working on my CMS scripts for yet another evening, and came across my other/better half watching the movie "Starship Troopers" on network TV. I was amazed that (a) she had never seen it before, and (b) she was even watching it.

She then admitted that when the film first started, she thought it was some kind of spoof - and then after fifteen minutes or so the realisation hit her that, no, this film wasn't a comedy. They were not playing it for laughs. This was deadly serious, and yes, this movie was by far the most unintentionally funny and best worst movie ever.

Of course, I already knew that Starship Troopers is one of the most hilariously mindless, stupid, crap movies ever made, but then you don't see it for a while and you forget just how stupid it really is.

They must have spent so much money on the special effects in Starship Troopers, and when the credits rolled, all W said was "that has to be the biggest load of rubbish I've ever seen in my life".

It must take some doing to make a really bad film on such a big budget. You get all kinds of special effects companies involved, and because they only see a small part of it, they don't realise what the producers and director are going to do to the final thing when they join it all together... they must have wondered why they were making titles like "Know Your Foe!"...

Thankfully, the couple of hours that Starship Troopers was on the telly didn't really waste a couple of hours of W's life - it's one of those movies where you can over-hear it while doing something else, and it doesn't actually detract from the experience you would have had if you had been to the cinema to see it.

Unfortunately we did waste a couple of hours of our lives on our second date by going to see "Mission Impossible 2". That's another story entirely though.

Apple are releasing a new Mac.

It's sexy.

I want one.

It's 339 in the UK - that's as cheap as a PC.

Nuff said.

On another note, I played Lord of the Rings Risk with my other half last night and lost terribly. Never in history has somebody consistently lost dice rolls in a board game like I did last night.

Bah Humbug.

I threw half of my army away trying to get rid of W's army from their stronghold - and consistently lost every attempt I made to knock them about. In then end I must have thrown away about 20 units and got nowhere...

Load of crap.

We keep thinking about getting the "War of the Ring" board game, but it's pretty expensive. I think the Mac might come first

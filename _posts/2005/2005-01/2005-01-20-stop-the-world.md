Have you ever felt like shouting "stop the world, I want to get offseveral projects are running towards deadlines at the same time as each other, and guess who is stuck in the middle of them all. One of the projects depends upon code from my CMS system before it's development can be completed, so somebody else's progress is now dependent on my own progress - not a nice place to be.

At the same time an old project has come back to life and I find myself with requests to fix things and make changes in order to keep them out of my way.

Add to that ongoing helpdesk support calls, and filling paperwork, and you start to realise how many directions I am being pulled in.

It's not fun. I keep telling myself it's good to be busy, but some days that's difficult to hear.

This evening should be a welcome break though. Earlier in the week we had some friends round for a meal, and tonight we are having some other friends round for a meal... kind of catching up with everybody we didn't see over Christmas. I'm cooking Spaghetti Bolognese (since W's finger chopping accident, I am chief chef). We make bolognese with Veggie-mince because W is a vegetarian. Most people can't tell the difference anyway

Saturday morning is almost over, and I have got nothing done. I've been messing around with Yahoo 360 all morning (which I knew nothing about until an old friend emailed me a "friend invite" on it). If you are insterested, the URL it http://360.yahoo.com - and for those reading this on Yahoo 360, I cross-post my blog entries to several destinations 

I guess we're going to trudge into town in a bit to take some photos in, and get something to eat for lunch.

Last night we got in from work and I popped out to the garage to get something to drink. As is typical, the garage was shut so I carried on walking into town. On the way I thought "I'm going to be near enough Blockbusters that I might as well go and see what movies are out"... I cam home with three of their ex-rental movies to add to our collection - Finding Neverland, National Treasure, and Alien vs. Predator. We were in a particularly brainless mood after a hard week at work, so watched National Treasure and the Alien movies last night - surprisingly not crap!

What is it about Nicholas Cage? I want to not like him, but end up liking his movies (mind you, I've only seen a few of them - things like "It Could Happen to You", and "City of Angels").

Anyway - I better get on. If I don't get away from this damn computer I'll get nothing done at all today...

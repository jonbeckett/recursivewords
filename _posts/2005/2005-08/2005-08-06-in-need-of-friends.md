I have been playing with the online beta of Yahoo's new "360" service today - and so far I think it's fantastic. The only problem I have so far is that I have no friends 

My "profile" on there is at the following address;

http://360.yahoo.com/jonbeckett73

Please, please, please go and join (if you don't already have a Yahoo account, and request me as a friend.

It looks like Yahoo are going to do their best to kill Google's "Orkut", MySpace, and a few of the others with 360 when it goes live...

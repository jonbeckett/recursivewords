I'm currently reading "The Heart of the Sea", a book about the true story that "Moby Dick" was inspired by.

Here's the blurb from Amazon;

The epic true-life story of one of the most notorious martime disasters of the 19th century which was the inspiration for Herman Melville's classic novel "Moby Dick". The author uses a hitherto unknown diary of one of the survivors discovered in an attic in Connecticut in spring 1998 to tell the tale. The sinking of the whaleship Essex by an enraged sperm whale in the Pacific in November 1820 set in motion one of the most dramatic sea stories of all time: the twenty sailors who survived the wreck took to three small boats (one of which was again attacked by a whale) and only eight of them survived their subsequent 90-day ordeal, after resorting to cannibalizing their mates. Three months after the Essex was broken up, the whaleship Dauphin, cruising off the coast of South America, spotted a small boat in the open ocean. As they pulled alongside they saw piles of bones in the bottom of the boat, at least two skeletons' worth, with two survivors - almost skeletons themselves - sucking the marrow from the bones of their dead ship-mates.

So for I've been really impressed with it. By halfway through the book the attack has already happened, so I'm guessing the remainder of the book is the story of the crew's survival. It's a great account of what the Nantucket Whaling industry must have been like in the early 1800's.

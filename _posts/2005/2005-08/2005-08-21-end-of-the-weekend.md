It's late on Sunday night and I guess it's the end of the weekend.

W's brother came over this afternoon (he's staying over), and we went to the pub for something to eat and a few drinks tonight. We started out at "The George" (the George and Dragon), and finished up in the "Two Brewers" - mainly because it was a hot night, and W and myself thought a pint of "Hoegarden" would be a good idea. It's a belgian wheat beer, and tastes really great then the weather is warm.

The George has changed their menus - they now have less choice than ever in their bar menu - obviously so they can push more people into their restaurant. It didn't really affect us because we all wanted something fairly light - we ended up all having baguettes anyway.

I'm turning into a lightweight too. I drank two pints of cider, a pint of hoegarden, and then a J2O (non alcoholic fruit drink). I think half the reason I couldn't really drink tonight had something to do with 3 cans of Guinness, and half a bottle of wine last night... (we had friends over for a barbecue last night).

Anyway... I have lots of nothing to get on with (did I mention I have the whole week off work hehe).

Expect lots of blog entries, and maybe some cartoon drawings to appear before too long!

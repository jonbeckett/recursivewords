It's the weekend, and I have a week off to look forward to!!

I actually have 10 days off in a rowcounting weekends, which is the longest time I have had off since we went to visit my relatives in California a few years ago. At the moment I'm a bit giddyI don't really know what I'm going to do with myself.

W has monday through wednesday off work too, so we are promising ourselves to go out and do things we always planned to dolike visiting the museums in Oxford (figure this outI lived 20 minutes from Oxford for the first 27 years of my life, and never visited the big museums).

This week at work was really tiring. I have been working on a big C# (C Sharp) projectit's the "new" .

NET development language from Microsoft. Although I am normally seen as something of a Microsoft basher at work, I have to hand it to them with .

NETor rather Visual Studio 2003it's remarkably straightforward to develop with. ENOUGH! Enough about work. I'm on HOLIDAY!

I thought I might get my paints out next week and do some paintingor maybe write some short stories. It's a while since I've written anything worth shouting about, and with taking part in Nanowrimo later this year it might be an idea if I stretch the old grey matter a bit.

I shall write more throughout my wonderful week off

Part of the week may involve hunting down a game called "Animal Crossing" for the Nintendo Gamecubeafter an online friend recommended it to me

Last night I finally called my cousin in California after missing each other with various phone calls over the last few weeks. It transpired that she has MSN Messenger and Skype installed, so it's no problem to keep in touch now. We spent about an hour talking on Skype - I switched my webcam on too, which blew my uncle away; he's never really got involved in the whole computer thing, let alone the internet.

While talking to her I remembered that I had an email a couple of days ago from the domain name registrar of her business (Betty's Organics), and started asking her what was going on with her website - she started putting it together about 12 months ago and never really got anywhere with it.

I then took it upon myself to build the site for her - and the snapshot above is the result of one evening's worth of a professional website developer's work (visit Bettys Organics website to see the full thing). I'm not that happy with it yet, but it's better than it was. Half the problem was having no photos - I had to source everything from my own photo collection at home.

I started on the website at about 9pm last night, and finished at 1:30am this morning. It's probably worth pointing out that the website runs on top of my content management engine (see the CMS project at PluggedOut), which made things a lot easier.

Anyway - it's just gone 9am now, so I better get on with some work

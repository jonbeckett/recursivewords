I found a wonderful music feed on the internet this morning called "Folk Alley" (http://www.folkalley.com). As the title would suggest, it's a folk music website. The great thing is they have music feeds in all the major formats.

I found it while messing around with WinAmp this morning trying to find a decent music feed to listen to while writing a blog entry - and here I find myself writing an entry about the feed I found.

I took something of a unilateral decision yesterday to stop cross-posting my Blog to Livejournal and Blogger. Nobody probably reads them anyway. What I have done is included my main blog as a feed on Yahoo 360 through "FeedBurner" (for some reason my perfectly formatted RSS2 feed is not interpreted correctly by Yahoo's feed aggregation server).

I'm hungry...

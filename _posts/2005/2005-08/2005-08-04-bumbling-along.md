It's just gone 10pm and I find myself sat at the dining table with my old laptop (so rubbish that a name has been coined for it - "the craptop").

We got next to nothing done again tonight - mainly because W was so late home again, and I spent the time between us getting in tidying up the house. After we had eaten dinner it was gone 9 and the evening had already gone.

Like I said - I'm sat here with the old laptop typing this, with a glass of apple juice and Aerosmith blaring out across the lounge (the "Big Ones" album, if you're interested).

I've just had a very bizarre conversation with a friend on MSN messenger where we decided that Gandalf would beat Stephen Tyler in a fight... although Ian McKellan would probably have very naughty fantasies about Aerosmith. I have some strange conversations sometimes.

I've been thinking ahead about Nanowrimo again. I'm kind of looking forward to it. It'll be fun to live with my trusty text editor for a month of evenings, cranking out the words. I might take a week off in November specially. I know it's possible to write 50,000 words in a month because I've written half that amount in 2 days before - for my A-Level computer science project documentation many years ago.

Cool - "Janie Got A Gun" just came on. Fantastic tune. I had forgotten how much I love Aerosmith. W saw them live in concert when they played Wembley with the orchestra a few years back. She's seen so many bands... the only "big" live concert I have been to was Jean Michel Jarre at Wembley Stadium back in about 1992.

Since I've known W she's been trying to "culture" me up - we regularly go to the theatre, and have seen some really great plays. My favourite so far probably has to be "Noises Off" by Michael Frayne (of "Spies" fame). I still haven't read Spies - I need to add it to my ever growing list of books to read. I still haven't got past the first couple of pages of the latest Harry Potter book either.

We saw a Shakespeare play on the beach in California - "Pericles" - the setting was amazing and made it very special indeed.

My mind is wandering really badly tonight. It must be something to do with getting on well at work at the moment - I've been learning C# (c sharp) and am starting to come back to the surface after drowning for a couple of days. I can see what needs to be done now and am making really good progress.

Anyway. My glass of Apple juice is running low. The fridge beckons.

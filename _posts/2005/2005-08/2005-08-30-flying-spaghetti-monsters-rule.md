In these days of internet censorship, and legions of Dudley Doorights walking the land preaching their bible-bashing sermons upon the great unwashed (read: don't cares), it comes as something of a breath of fresh air when something like the Flying Spaghetti Monster appears.

I completely agree with all of the arguments supporting the "arguments supporting the existence of the Flying Spaghetti Monster".

In the face of so many idiots preaching the bible at you, praising god for this, god for that, and god for the other, it's really nice to point them towards the FSM, and sit back to see if they get the point or not.

Anyway - without further ado, here's the important URL;

I just did the "Brainiac" test at www.tickle.com - I got 28 out of the 30 questions right - here's the result summary (and I'm not gloating, honest)...

Congratulations! Your score is in the 99th percentile. This means that if one hundred people took the test with you, your score would rank higher than 98 of them on average.

When we analysed your test, we also discovered that when it comes to logical ability, you measure in the 100th percentile. This score indicates you have unusually strong abilities when it comes to solving problems with logic. There are situations that require having a very precise thinking process to cut through the array of stimuli, and you can do this well. You can easily detect the underlying logic while others cannot. While others may get confused by things that are complex or out of order, your logical ability allows you to persevere and solve multi-layered problems.

I know I guessed at one of the questions, but I'm still annoyed I got one of the others wrong...

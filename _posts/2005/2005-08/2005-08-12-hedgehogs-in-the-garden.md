We just heard some huffing and puffing out in the garden, so turned everything off and went out to investigate - and found our resident family of hedgehogs out doing their circuit of the garden - eating bugs, slugs and snails as they go.

The picture is of one of the bigger ones - as I approached with the camera another big one ran off, and a tiny baby one (smaller than a tennis ball) froze on the patio. While I was looking at the baby one the adults made as much noise as possible to distract me... clever 

I love wild animals. It's great to know that we have so many things living in our garden - even if I do hate looking after the lawn so much.

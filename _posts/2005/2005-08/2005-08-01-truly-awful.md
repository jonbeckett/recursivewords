Ever since I woke up this morning at 7am I have had a banging headache. I've felt really tired and feeble too. I drank water all morning to see if I was just de-hydrated, but it hasn't really worked. I don't want to resort to taking tablets, but if it goes on much longer I'll have to.

I'm sat here watching the progress bar tick across the screen moving several gigabytes of files across the network to my workstation - which is why I'm writing a blog entry.

This lunchtime B challenged me to a game of chess. I think he anticipated that my headache would mean an easy victory for him. In the first game I went a piece up early on. He fought well through the middlegame, but once I solved all my problems on the board, his whole position fell apart. My first win against him in probably a week. We then played a second game and he lost a pawn within a few moves. Following that I traded most of the pieces off the board and eventually won a pawn race to promote. It's nice to be winning again. Perhaps being a bit off colour has meant that I'm not being impulsive or something?

This weekend was okay - if a little hectic. On Friday night we had a really nice meal at the Tiger Cub restaurant in Marlow to celebrate 5 years together (myself and W met in Oxford 5 years ago on the 29th July). We were pleasantly surprised by "Tiger Cub" - the owners have a bigger restaurant in town called "Tiger Garden", which we've been to several times before. The new restaurant is a proper "restaurant" instead of a curry house. The food comes out as chef prepared dishes rather than the usual bowls stacked in the centre of the table. We were really impressed, and the food tasted amazing. It's a bit more expensive than their big restaurant, but like I said - the atmosphere and service were far more exclusive.

After that the weekend was something of a slog. We went into town to post things on Saturday morning, then on to a 1st birthday party after lunch, then back to the house to get various things ready to go to W's parents on Sunday - to go out for a meal to celebrate W's mum's 60th. We finally got home yesterday evening at about 9pm.

I almost feel guilty for saying it, but I wonder when we're going to get a few days to ourselves again. The house is slowly turning into a tip because we're never there to sort things out. Take this evening for instance - I've been sat here today at work feeling distinctly crap, and know that when I get in I'm going to have to tidy up for about an hour, then spend the rest of the night washing and ironing. Bang goes doing anything I might "like" to be doing.

I'm not complaining about having to do chores - I'm just complaining that sometimes weeks stack up on top of one another when you have no time to really relax. Some people will think I'm wingeing, but if you both work in fairly stressful jobs and don't usually get in until nearly 7 in the evening, you start to see my point.

I can't remember the last time I watched television, or even sat down and played a computer game for more than about 10 minutes.

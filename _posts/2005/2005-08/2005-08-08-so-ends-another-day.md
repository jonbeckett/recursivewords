If you hadn't figure this out yet, I tend to write in my blog every day. I write about anything and everything - usually the most boring humdrum things that have happened that day, but it's all real. It's all "true"...

That sounds like a Budweiser advert, doesn't it - "true".

Today started by oversleeping, and waking up at about 8am. Actually, that's a complete lie. I woke up at 7:30 and fell asleep again. W got up first and I eventually managed to drag myself downstairs.

Upon reaching the lounge, I was greeted by W excitedly babbling "My Frogs came first and second!"... it took a few seconds to register what on earth she was talking about. We went to visit friends on Saturday night, and they showed us a silly website they had found - www.racingfrogs.com. The website has consumed W completely. Apparently you create and train a virtual frog, and then each night it takes part in races. I swear that she actually worries about her frogs... they're not even REAL!

Anyway - I got into work and finally a few of the guys are back of holiday, so I managed to get a fair amount of work done today. Back up to my neck in C# programming for the migration project I'm working on. I'll stop there before I send you to sleep in your chair.

I left work at about 6pm and got home at around 6:30 - while in the middle of washing up W called and told me that she was leaving; in the end she arrived home at about 7:15, with a wine bottle in her hand - we went straight out to the deck and swapped the story of our day with a glass of white zinfandel.

The doors are still open now as I write this - it's a nice evening. I have Simon and Garfunkle on the stereo and we're sat chilling while I wait for the jacket potatoes to cook in the oven.

I guess I should go and start preparing everything else. I'm getting hungry...

It's coming up to lunchtime on Sunday and we're having a quiet day at home (isn't it great sometimes when you get to just have a chilled out day at the weekend to mess around and do what you want).

Last night we went into town to help celebrate a friend's 30th birthday. We were instructed to be at the "Ship" in Marlow for about 8 - with A arriving at 8:30ish. A pretty great time was had by all, although we didn't end up sticking around for that long because we had not eaten since lunchtime (we thought there was going to be a barbecue at the pub, but it didn't happen for some reason - probably the rain that fell throughout the day).

I got A a rubiks cube for his birthday - I was thinking "what would he remember from his childhood that would be a great thing for people to also pass around in the pub too?" - and saw the rubiks cube in a toyshop (yes, I was looking in a toyshop for a 30th birthday present).

One thing of note in the pub was a pinball machine - I haven't seen a pinball machine for years. After a couple of goes between about 6 of us, I figured out that some people are just born lucky - and I'm not one of them. Quite how I can score 6 million, and somebody else can score 45 million is beyond me.

After we left the pub we went on to Zizzi - an italian restaurant, with some friends of ours and had a very late meal. We arrived at gone 10pm, and amazingly weren't the last to leave. We left our car in town and got a lift home - so were both up at 8 this morning to go and fetch the car.

I think some friends are coming round this evening to watch "Troy" with us - we've seen it before and they haven't - and W needs no encouragement to watch Brad Pitt and Eric Banna running around in togas.

So - there you have the story of our weekend so far. W is still sat playing "Zelda the Wind Waker" on the Gamecube. I did manage to get a go on it mid-morning to play Mario Kart against her, but otherwise she has hogged it ever since I plugged it in. So much for me being the game nut in the house.

I'm hungry... wonder what I can find in the kitchen?

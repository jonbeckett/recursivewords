Today started out as a remarkably crap day, then got even worse, but ended on something of a high.

I overslept again this morningwaking up just before 8 and really struggling to get out of bed. By the time I had a wash, got dressed and made a cup of tea for myself and W, and fed the cat, it was 8:45 time to jump on the bike and go.

I had been planning (this morning) to get cracking on the development of a new tool at work to assist in the movement of documents between enterprise content management systems. My morning ended up being an exercise in fighting fires at several of our major clients.

I finally got started on the development work in the early afternoon, and after looking at the legacy code in Visual Basic for about half an hour took the decision (in the absence of anybody senior to discuss it with) to write the tool in C# (the dot net language from Microsoft). The main reason for doing it was that one of my colleagues had written a huge amount of really good code in Java that I could migrateC# and Java are very similar to each other indeed.

Soby the end of the day I had started to make progress at last. I have to admit that Visual Studio .

NET has impressed me greatly so far. I should also concede that I am using VS.

NET 2003which is the result of about 5 years worth of development from Microsoft; I'm not exactly an early adopter. I also have the benefit of an up-to-date MSDN membership at workmeaning I have about 2 gig's worth of documentation for all the Microsoft products on my machine.

I got home from work at about 18:30, and did my usual round of tidying up, putting a load of washing in the machine, and re-loading the dishwasher. After a while I realised time was getting on and W was still not home, so called her at work. I half guessed she would be late because she is an accountant, and she would more than likely be working on the month end figures.

Finally at about 19:50 W called to let me know she was leaving work (with a 45 minute drive ahead of her) so I walked into town to get some nice food for dinner. We had garlic bread, and pasta in a sauce. Ohand a big bowl of kettle chips, and a big jug of cranberry juice. We finally ate at about 9pm.

I'm sat here now (at just gone 22:00) typing this, and wondering where the night really went. The week tends to be a big of a slog at the moment. Let's home it gets easier.

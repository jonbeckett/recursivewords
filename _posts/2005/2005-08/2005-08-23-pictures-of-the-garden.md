It was a nice afternoon, and I had a few minutes to kill after cleaning my mountain bike (did I mention for the 50th time that I have the whole week off work), so went out in the sunshine with the camera... here's the results;

We picked these apples from the apple tree this afternoon - we're going to take some down for my parents when we visit them later in the week.

This is (unsurprisingly) the apple tree that the apples came from. We did a combination of climbing steps around the tree, and W climbing up the tree. I got told off for making certain sexist comments about her when she climbed down (I thought they were compliments) 

And this is me arsing about.

A picture of the pond, which is probably giving rise to new life forms by now.

What a strange thing to take a photo of - pegs on the ground. I like brightly coloured things, and thought it might bugger the camera up - the reds really are wrong, aren't they...

And finally - spotted this spiders web on the decking at the back of the house. Didn't know if the camera would focus on it (it's a Fuji Finepix, so it's mostly automatic)... amazed that it worked.

I shall have to try and find something else to take a picture of now  Suggestions?

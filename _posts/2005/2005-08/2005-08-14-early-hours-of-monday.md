I'm sat here playing the old trick of trying to make the weekend last longer by staying up late on Sunday night.

The picture for this entry was taken in the back garden a couple of days ago - it's of the flowers on one of the squash (pumpkin) plants that W is growing. The sun came out and it looked pretty so I took the picture.

Half the reason for avoiding the coming week is that I have to try and get some work finished that I am not confident about finishing. It's already late, it's complicated, and it's involved with a system that I have next to no experience or knowledge of. I hate being caught in projects where I don't really know the surrounding technology. I guess I should shut up - I'm already rambling and getting boring.

I was playing with Yahoo 360 this afternoon and made a new friend - the internet is wonderful sometimes. I think Yahoo switched on the "testimonial" feature in 360 this weekend (either that, or I was too stupid to notice it before) - so I spent a few minutes writing a few lines for the people I have met so far that I like. It's funny isn't it - it only takes a few moments to write something nice to somebody, and yet it can make so much difference to your day if you know that somebody somewhere thought of you.

I guess crap days are when you find out who really cares about how crap your day is...

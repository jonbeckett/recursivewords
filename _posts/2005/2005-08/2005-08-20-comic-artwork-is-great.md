Here's where I admit in my blog that I'm a massive fan of comic artwork. I don't actually own many comics (about 4 I think - in various places around the house). Sometimes while surfing the web I come across fantastic online comics too, and find myself just appreciating the artwork rather than reading the comic strips - but today is a different kind of day - I found a quirky comic that I read, and loved...

It's called Bolt City, and is absolutely wonderful. If you visit the main site (http://www.boltcity.com, the guy that draws it has done loads of them - and each story is short, quirky, and really great.

Enjoy!

If you're wondering how on earth I managed to get this blog system to do the layout like this, I fiddled with the HTML  Comes of being a web geek I suppose...

So what's going on in the real world today? We're having some friends over this evening to have a barbecue - hopefully the weather will hold (I'm wearing shorts to try and show the weather what it should be doing). We have to go out this afternoon and buy some food and drink.

That all has to wait though - I'm watching the Formula One qualifying while typing this... a Minardi's brakes just caught fire

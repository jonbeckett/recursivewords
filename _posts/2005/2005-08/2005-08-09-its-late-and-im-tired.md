It's nearly midnight as I write this, and I'm getting tired. The X-Files movies is on the television though, so I guess I'll stay up and watch through to the end of it; I haven't seen it in ages.

When X-Files was originally shown on the television years ago I was a big fan of it - well, for the first couple of seasons. By the end of the second season they had exhausted all the UFO conspiracy theory and had to start inventing their own stories - at that point it all went a bit wrong...

I used to read so many books about conspiracy theory and UFOs. It's funny - I remember back when I was about 18 a friend of the family telling me that when he was younger he read the books and had such an open mind to the amazing things that might be possible - and that as he got older he became more cycnical and his mind closed. I find the same thing happening to myself.

It's funny - there was a quote in one of the first episodes of the X-Files that pretty much sums up my views these days; "Deep Throat: Mr Mulder, why are those like yourself, who believe in the existance of Extra Terrestrials not dissuaded by all the evidence in the contrary? Mulder: Because all the evidence in the contrary is not entirely dissuasive."

After years picking up books now and again, and growing older - perhaps more balanced, more patient, perhaps even cynical, I have not been dissuaded that there is "something" more to the universe than just us, and we have come into contact with it.

I'm too tired to write a lot about it now, but I'll let you go and do some searching in Google if you have some spare time - or just click on the link below and scare yourself stupid... this is the tip of an enormous iceberg.

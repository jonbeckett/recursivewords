Today has been a strange kind of day. For the first time in several days the support calls have not really flooded in, meaning I could get on with development work - except I was unable to really do as much as I wanted because we were instructed not to use the WAN (internet) connection due to an important conference call taking place downstairs with some product demo or other...

Unfortunately all my plans this afternoon centred around using the internet connection to get the software I have been working on put in place. It did force me to go through the code and do a quality check on it though. I found a couple of strange issues with it, but otherwise I'm pretty pleased.

Today I've had a pretty bad cold, and it's getting worse. I'm a bit worried because I'm supposed to be doing at least one mid-week run in preparation for the Marlow 5, but there's now way I'm going out in the cold and wet with a cold. Have to see how I feel at the weekend. I'm tempted to go and actually run the course (they have in on the website of the club that organises the race). It will be interesting to see if I can jog around it in something like 45 minutes - I'm aiming for about 40 minutes "on the day".

Just looking around, my desk is a real tip today. I have various industry freebie magazines strewn around the place, a SQL book, a wireless LAN card, a kettle lead, some anti-static bags, a phone map of the offices, my mug (with a lovely Roy Lichtenstein print on it), and a tumbler.... oh, and my Palm 3 is hiding over there under a printout.

The side is off my computer at the moment - the anti-static bags that are still led on my desk had extra memory in them - I nicked one for my desktop machine - I now have 1Gb of memory and things are a fair bit more brisk than they used to be (especially when running more than one virtual machine).

Anyway... the end of the day is getting near and here I am. Listening to Jeff Buckley on WinAmp. His "Grace" album is great. Earlier on I was listening to Duran Duran's "Greatest" album

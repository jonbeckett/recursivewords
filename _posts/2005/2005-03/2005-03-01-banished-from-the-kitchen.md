It's Tuesday night and I find myself banished from the Kitchen.

W is (I suspect) baking me a birthday cake in the kitchenhence my enforced exile in the front room where the computer is. Apparently I'm not allowed through the kitchen under any circumstances.

I accidentally found out what I've got for my birthday earlier this weekthe War of the Ring boardgame. W had the day off yesterdaythe box arrived, and she had left in on the couch in the loungeI wandered in after work, and while taking my coat off, spotted it. W was gutted that she forgot to hide it, but it doesn't really matter that much.

For those who have no idea what on earth this board game is, it's kind of like "Risk", but with bells on Far more complex, and generally based on the Lord of the Rings books by J.

R.

R.

Tolkien. It's by far the biggest (physically) board game I have ever seen strangely enough, when I went in to work today I was telling one of the other guys about it, and he said "that's funnyI bought that on Saturday too".

We haven't actually had a game of it yet, but we have had everything out of the box and familiarised ourselves with the "simple" rules and the various pieces, cards, tokens and so on. The simple rules are a bit like Riskas I saidthe more complex "standard" rules are completely foreign to me at the moment it starts to involve the rings given to the Kings of middle earth, and various complex political events.

AnywayI'm probably being incredibly boring going into the minutae of this board game. Why on earth have I become so interested in board games? Probably as another diversion to get me away from computer screens, and to do something involving other people

Although "gaming" (i.e. D&D etc) tends to have a really bad reputation, it is actually far more social than computer games when you think about it.

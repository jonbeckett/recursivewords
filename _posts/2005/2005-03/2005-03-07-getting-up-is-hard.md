Why is getting out of bed on Monday mornings so damn difficult?

(I'm busy waiting for a new version of Java to install on a virtual machine, hence this idiotic ramblic in my blog).

Today is Monday (if you had not guessed by looking at the time stamp on this entry), and I am at work, hacking away at a solution for a client. This one wants a webpage where they can choose several documents (in TIF format) that they want to turn into one document.

Changing tach entirely, we spent this weekend out and about - on Saturday we went and had lunch with W's family (partly for mothers day on Sunday, and partly for W's Mum and Dad's anniversary), then on Saturday night we went to stay at my brother's on the other side of Oxford - where we had a beer/pizza/formula one extravaganza 

I went to bed at about midnight, then got back up at 2am to watch the Australian Grand Prix - the first one with the new rules (they are not allowed to change tyres any more). It was a bit of a strange one because qualifying got wrecked by rain halfway through the session - which meant Giancarlo Fisichella won very easily indeed. It will be interesting to see just how fast the Renault can go; it was obvious they were not pushing at all.

It would also appear that Ferrari are nowhere near the pace this year yet. Yay! About time they had a really spectacularly bad year... and I'm guessing they will have a hard job getting the rules rigged this time to help them.

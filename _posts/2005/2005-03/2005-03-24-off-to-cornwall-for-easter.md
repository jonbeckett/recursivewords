The work week is drawing to a close here in the UK as we prepare for the easter break - Friday and Monday are "Bank Holidays" in the UK, so everybody gets the day off... well - all except those who work in shops, gas stations and so on.

We're travelling down to stay at my parents in Cornwall tonight - I can't say I'm really looking forward to the 5 hour drive awaiting us tonight. This week seems to have been a bit hectic - we arrived back from France on Monday night, back to work on Tuesday, out on tuesday night with W's parents, then out last night running with a friend of mine, then tonight we're driving to Cornwall...

It didn't help that at about 9:30 last night I decided it would be a good idea to have a "quick go" on Gran Turismo... at 2am I decided I had better go to bed. Mind you - I won several championships in those few hours I also discovered that I'm much faster at driving the car than the computer is - I ran it in "B-Spec" mode, where you act as race director and my "modified" Mazda RX7 got slowly left behind against the likes of McLaren GTRs and Saleen's - but in my hands I wiped the floor with them. I am the master

Anyway - this is me signing off until early next week. I guess I might look in on the blog from deepest darkest cornwall if I get a chance.

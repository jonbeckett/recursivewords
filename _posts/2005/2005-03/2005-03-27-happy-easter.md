Just a short posting this morning to say happy easter to everybody who might read this blog - I have no idea who you are, but I hope you have a good easter wherever you are anyway

I was up at 8am (7am before I put my watch right - due to the clocks going forwards in the UK) , and went for a run. We are staying at my parents in Cornwall for easter, so the run this morning was down to Talland and back; a pretty horrific hill that I didn't really think about before running down and back up... I didn't go all the way to the beach because the last section is about a 30% gradient (i.e. there is no way you can run up or down it), but I managed the rest of the way. The only aches and pains I seem to have is a bit of soreness in my shins - probably predictable from pounding down a hill for 15 minutes, and then carrying myself back up the hill for another 15 minutes. Still - it all helps get rid of my belly...

Today we're having a bit of a lazy day. We opened our easter eggs after everybody was up at about 9:30 - I've eaten mine already - and since then have been lounging around the house. W is knitting, and I am playing chess on the internet. I keep thinking about resurrecting the chess engine project that I started a long time ago, but know that it's one of those hobbies that will become all-consuming; hence my reluctance to even look at it.

Yesterday we went out sailing on my father's boat - out of Torpoint, and for a trip past Plymouth, Drake Island, and then back. It was amazing weather, and for fun on the way back we passed underneath Brunel's railway bridge at Tamar to take some photos (I'll post them to the blog when they are developed).

Anyway - like I said, Happy Easter, and I'll write again when I get home!

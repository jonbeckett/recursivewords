Myself and a good friend started our training in earnest for the Marlow 5 running race in May last night - we went out for a gentle run around town just to figure out how unfit we are.

We ended up doing about a 3 mile lap of town, and felt surprisingly good afterwards; and of course we felt better for having done it. Luckily I don't expect to have any aches and pains because I went running while we were in France last week (a couple of laps of the parade grounds at the Ecole Militaire - the park where the Eiffel Tower stands at the end). Running with somebody definitely made it much easier than running on my own - just having somebody to chat with and take my mind off the running was a great distraction 

So - this morning I find myself looking at a help call at one of our major clients. They decided to switch half of their network to a different domain, and active directory - and didn't let us know in advance what they were planning to do... and they wondered why half the systems fell over. Ho hum...

I have discovered (to my horror) that the company I work for holds the intellectual property rights over anything I do involving software development - no matter where or when I have worked on anything.

Therefore (strictly speaking) my various open source scripts are not owned by me. How crap is that...

Don't be surprised if you start to see banners for GNU and such projects appearing on my projects. I'm going to find some visible way of displaying my displeasure about this to anybody and everybody...

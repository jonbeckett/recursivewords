In what appears to be something of a pattern, I went into town to get my hair cut on Saturday morning, and there were loads of people in the barbers, so I ended up wandering around the shops - and went home with a copy of Gran Turismo 4 in my pocket 

Okay - lets get the argument over now. Gran Turismo looks better and plays better than any driving game on any console. It doesn't have as good artificial intelligence in the opponent drivers, and it doesn't have vehicle damage, but the basic game is light years more fun, more challenging and more accessible than any other game I have seen (and that's quite a few of them).

I'm not really sure how they have done it, but GT4 has a complete rendition of the Nurburgring Nordschlief (sp?) - 13 miles long and photo realistic. My brother in law tells me that following reading various car magazines, the track is absolutely spot-on to the real one - complete with grafitti on the track wherever it appears in real life. In true saddo fashion, I spent a few minutes driving along the track, stopping to read the various bits of grafitti.

Anyway... I should be getting on with some work.

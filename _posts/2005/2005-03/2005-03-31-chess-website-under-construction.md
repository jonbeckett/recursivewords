Yet another project... I'm not sure I really have the time (or the will) to get this project up and running anytime soon, but I have started on the development of a website that will hopefully make money - a correspondence chess website.

I have basically become fed up with the various chess websites out there because they either don't work how I think they should work, don't allow me to do what I would like to do, or are just badly designed. I've been thinking about writing one for a while, and I now have all the relevant experience to go ahead and write one from scratch.

Last night I found myself writing the move validation functions - to stop people making moves that are not possible. It's more difficult than it sounds - as well as figuring out where a piece can move to, you also need to make sure that moving a piece doesn't let your king end up "in check". I think I've solved all the issues to do with that, but I still have a long way to go with it.

I'll write more when I get a chance.

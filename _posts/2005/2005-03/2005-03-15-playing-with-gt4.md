Tonight I have been playing with the "Photo Tour" mode in Gran Turismo 4 - the basic idea being that you do a few laps of a given track in one of "your" cars, and can then step out of the replay to a "Photography" mode, where you get full control of the camera angle and camera settings... it really is quite spooky.

Through a bit of genius, Sony have seen to it that I can plug my USB key into the PS2 and save the photos off for use on a computer - and it worked immediately without having to set anything up...

Here's the photos (click on them for the full image...)

It goes without saying that if you are impressed with these pictures, imagine what the game looks like moving at 60 frames per second, with full surround sound... and a physics model to die for.

This game urinates all over everything that's come before from a considerable height (including GT3).

Feel free to comment !

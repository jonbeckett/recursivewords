I'm just taking a quick break from my development work (I'm at work as I write this), so thought I would write about my day so far.

Got up at 6:45am and went for a run around town - only did about 2 miles, but I've not been running for ages so I figured it's a good idea to get back into it gently. The "Marlow 5" running event is in May so I should have plenty enough time to enter it.

There is a 10k race at Woodley fairly soon too - if I can get my mileage up during April I might think about doing that one.. on second thoughts it's probably just better to concentrate on getting ready for the Marlow 5 (5 miles = about 8 km).

Other than that, work has been fairly quiet. I'm working on a thin client TIF stitching thing (I'm not going to bother describing more than that at the moment)

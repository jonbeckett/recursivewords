Hi all, If you're wondering why there have been hardly any entries in my Blog for the last few days, it's because I have been writing in LiveJournal. I started out just having a look at it because a friend pointed me in it's direction, and have ended up liking it quite a lot - mainly because of its Communities. For the immediate future I'll probably cross-post between here and LiveJournal (at lease until I figure out the API for LJ).

I am finally working on something interesting - the company website. I have a bit of a slack week this week, so have taken the chance to get going on the new version of the website for the company I am employed by. While I say "taken the chance", it actually meant telling various managers that I had the time to do it, then finding out if they approved of me spending the time doing it...

It's a bit mad really, isn't it - having to scrape the time between customer projects to work on the company website, which customers see as our public persona... the same website that hasn't had any serious work done to it in two or three years.

So - I have spent today turning a professionally design "look and feel" for the website into a workable HTML template. The final part of that conundrum for me is in choosing if I should use CSS or basic old HTML for the presentation of the site. I guess we'll have to wait and see. The main nut to crack will be making sure the salesmen cannot nerf the site completely when they get their content management system logins.

I had a look at the Mambo CMS this morning, and decided after about an hour that (a) their admin interface sucks, and (b) my own CMS is far more powerful than theirs. The Mambo interface is far more polished than mine (remembering of course that my CMS is still only at 0.4.8), but it forces you into it's own way of doing things... my system is far more open ended. All it really forces you into thinking about is that "a page is a collection of content".

Anyway... time to go home I guess.

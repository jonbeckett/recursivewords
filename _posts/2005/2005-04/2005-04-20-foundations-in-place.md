I took the decision to request the project setups at SourceForge. I'm anticipating that my webhost will come back with a "no can do" following my enquiry about access to CVS on my web server, so it seemed logical to get the ball rolling with SourceForge straight away.

It's a bit worrying in a way - letting your code out into the wild for others to work on. The project will no longer be "mine"... I guess that's worth it though if I manage to build a team of good people, and having more than one person working on it will help immeasurably.

I guess this blog will reflect the results of that decision as events unfold over the next few weeks.

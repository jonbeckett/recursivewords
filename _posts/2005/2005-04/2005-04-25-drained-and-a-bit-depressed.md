We had to buy a new car this weekend, because W's is dying slowly. We discovered it had a problem the last time we went to visit my parents in cornwall - on the way back we had to be towed for the last 100 miles or so of the journey to save the car from blowing itself to pieces.

We can still drive the old car for journeys of an hour or less, but it's really not worth spending the money on fixing it - it's getting on now and is slowly turning into a money pit.

The picture above is of the new car we have bought. It's a Renault Megane Scenic. Very practical and boring, but it's as much as we could afford, and it should last us a few years at least.

Buying the car has put us into serious debt - we were already being careful because of doing the IVF (which, thankfully, W's parents have helped us with), but the car is totally down to us - and it's meant basically that we are back to square one with our mortgage. Add to that the fact that we still need to get the hole in the kitchen ceiling fixed, and we now need a new front door (because the old one is falling apart), and you start to see that the next few years are going to be filled with an endless series of attempts to make money.

It's kind of depressing. I am having to turn down an invitation to go on a good friend's stag night because we just can't afford it. Also, if the IVF does work out, I have no idea how we are going to afford to do a room up for the baby... I guess we'll figure that out if and when we get there.

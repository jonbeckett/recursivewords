I checked into gMail a little while ago to send an email into work warning them that I might not be available to go on client site next week, and discovered an email sent shortly after I left the office from one of the project managers, who has told a client I will be visiting them on Tuesday. F*cking dammit.

I warned the guys at work a couple of weeks ago that next week was the crunch time for our IVF stuff (myself and my better half are on our second go at IVF). The doctors have warned us that any kind of stress for either of us is a really bad thing. When we had our first go at IVF last year both of our lives got turned upside down by our work schedules, and guess what - this time it's happening all over again.

Yesterday I was in Hungerford (2 hours away), tomorrow I am in Hastings (3 hours away), and on Tuesday they want me to go to Westminster (2 hours away). These are all big clients that are important. In the middle of this, I need to go to the IVF clinic on Monday to have tests done, and on (probably) Wednesday or Thursday next week we go in for the egg collection, and so on - where we both need to be there all day.

Why does my life and work attempt to dump on me from such a great height again and again?

If the IVF cocks up again, don't be surprised if I send an invoice to work for three and a half thousand pounds - because that's what it will have cost us.

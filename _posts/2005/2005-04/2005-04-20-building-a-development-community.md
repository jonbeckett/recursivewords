I have spent the last half an hour putting the foundations in place to open my "open source" projects up to the world - to try and build a community of developers to take the project forwards.

Up until this point, I have been working on my projects alone - so although they are "open source", there has been minimal assistance from the community... part of that (I admit) is my own fault for not trusting the decisions and/or code that others might write. By the same token, I know there are areas of the design and code of my projects that I know should be re-done. Have I done anything about them? what do you think...

I just sent an email off to my web hosting provider asking if there is any chance I can have access to CVS, but I'm guessing they will say no - because I'll really need to add a load of users as well anyway (for the members of the community I'm trying to build).

I guess the question then becomes - do I just sourceforge my projects, or do I run my own server at home and expose CVS to the internet at large via ssh ?

Hmmm.... decisions decisions.

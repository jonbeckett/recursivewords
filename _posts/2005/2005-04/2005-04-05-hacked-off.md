I'm sat here at work this afternoon, and I really don't want to be here. I've got a dreadul cold that I've had since Thursday last week. It's really getting me down now.

Just to make matters worse, we're going to the IVF clinic tonight to find out the schedule of things happening following W going back onto the drugs a couple of days ago (if you need anybody with experience of mixing up cocktails of pharmaceuticals, and injecting people, I am now something of an expert). I'm going to have to ask them tonight if the virus I've had/have is likely to affect my part of the equation - it's sods law that it will wreck this IVF cycle - which effectively means 3.5K down the drain once more.

Of course the only reason I am at work instead of trying to get better at home is because I got told off last time I had a day off - therefore I am being a bit bloody minded about it now - I'll turn up when I have a virus and give it to everybody else. The office will be reduced to a handful of people, but hey! - they complained if people took too many days off with viruses.

Changing subject, I witnessed something last night that really annoyed the crap out of me. I was just leaving our local corner shop when I passed a gang of kids (all about 15 years old). I had noticed them hanging around outside when I went in, and the entire time I was in there, one of them was in the shop loitering around... as I walked out I overheard the group outside comparing the stuff they had stolen from the shop. Words cannot describe how annoyed I was.

The only thought that stopped me from turning around and questioning what they were doing was "what if one of them has a knife?". I even thought about calling the police when I got in, but what are they going to do? Where will the proof be? The thing that really really annoyed me is that these kids were picking on an Indian family who run the shop, and the family work all kinds of hours - the last thing they need is people thieving from them.

I'll get off my soap box now. I'm still bloody annoyed about it though.

I got up at about ten to seven this morning, and went straight out the door for a run (well - I put some clothes and shoes on first, obviously). I misjudged how cold it was a bit; I just had my normal running shorts and vest on, and was conscious by about halfway of how cold I was feeling - not good.

I did my normal 8km route along the river and through town, and set out with the aim of keeping running - no crafty stops to open gates, drink, or any other excuse. My father in law introduced me to crafty resting tactics while walking up various hills in the Lake District - where you "stop to admire the view". I'm pretty chuffed to say that I did the entire route without stopping at all, and could probably have run further. My very scientific timing method (glancing at my watch as I ran away from the house at the start) told me that I covered the 8km in a bit over 45 minutes. It's a bit slower than I would have liked, but at least I have until the 9th of next month to go a bit faster than that.

I got the notification through in the post about the Waddesdon Manor 5k race this morning. I did it last year, and enjoyed it a lot - it's happening this year in July. I'll probably enter it again because it was such good fun (I know that sounds crazy).

Oh - before I forget it happened (as I usually do with humdrum events), I nearly got knocked off my bike this morning. I avoided it because I was second guessing what was about to happen. In the middle of Marlow there is a double roundabout that I have to cross each morning. The traffic generally comes from either end of the pair of roundabouts, and I approach from one side. Anyway - as I started out across them, I saw this car accelerating from the bridge towards the roundabouts - and could see the stupid woman driving it was going way too fast, and was taking no notice of my existence at all. She ended up realising I was there and signalling to turn across her path WAY too late, and ended up nearly sliding into the middle of the roundabouts. Now correct me if I'm wrong (and I know I'm correct here) - you are supposed to approach any kind of junction with the anticipation that you will need to stop. How this woman could have stopped was anybodies guess - especially as I was on the roundabout as she approached! In a reflective yellow coat! and I'm not little!

Anyway... I guess I should get on with some work.

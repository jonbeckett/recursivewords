It's Monday morning, and I'm back at work.

I really didn't want to get up this morning. I kind of planned to go running early this morning, but woke up at about 6:55, looked out the window and thought "I'll go tonight"... the struggle now will be in forcing myself to go running this evening.

I finally managed to fall out of bed at about 8:05, had a shower and shave, found some clean clothes, had a cup of tea, trudged up to the shed, realised I had left the lawn mower and my bike out in the rain overnight, put the lawn mower away, climbed on my bike, and made my way into work. For some reason the wind is always against me wherever I go on my bike - especially in the morning. It's some kind of freak of physics.

Actually, anybody who rides a bike a lot on the roads knows all about Chaos theory, and "strange attractors". You know the rule that says that toast will always land butter side down? - that also applies to bikes, cars and puddles. You can be on the most quiet stretch of road for hundreds of miles, but if you approach a deep puddle, a car will materialise from nowhere and meet the puddle at exactly the same time you do - forcing you to go through it. It's happened to me so often that I have become convinced that "stange attractors" really do exist.

On the subject of falling toast, have you heard about the "buttered toast cat" thoery? - that if you strap a piece of buttered toast to the back of a cat, and throw it in the air, it won't hit the ground? Think about it... the toast wants to fall butter side down, and the cat wants to fall feet first - so they end up in equilibrium and hover just above the floor. I haven't tried it.

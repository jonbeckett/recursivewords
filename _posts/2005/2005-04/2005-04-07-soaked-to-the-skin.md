I just got in from work after a pretty dreadful cycle home. For those that don't know, I cycle to work (about 3 miles) on a mountain bike.

It was raining just about hard enough to completely soak me to the skin. I got in the door and stripped straight off in the middle of the kitchen... As I write this I'm sat here in a pair of tracksuit bottoms with a runny nose (yes, I have still got that damned cold).

This whole livejournal lark seems to be a good laugh. In the past I've used my own blog software, but I can see myself using this more as a community thing than my own system. I was just saying to somebody the other night that it's about time I took part in something rather than creating something - historically I have always been one of the people who creates websites; not one who takes part in them.

I think I have about an hour to chill out before we go out - perhaps I'll go and look around some of the communities in LiveJournal and see if anything looks interesting

Fantastic - Ferrari scored no points again in the Formula One grand prix in Bahrain. Absolutely brilliant Words cannot describe how good it is for motor racing in general that a team that behaves in the manner they do is doing as badly as they do.

Schumacher obviously had a very low fuel load, and Barichello destroyed his tires. Apparently Schumacher is far harder on tyres than Barichello, so it would have been fun to see him go backwards too. I was already a bit annoyed this weekend that even though Barichello is leading Schumacher on points, Ferrari only gave the good car parts to Schumacher (forcing Barichello to sit out most of the weekend with a broken car).

I agree'd with Martin Brundle's commentary too - Pedro De La Rosa was the most fun to watch; although I think Webber and Button both did really well too. Coulthard played the long game too - and scored a point I expect Villeneuve will get fired before too long.

Still... Ferrari did really badly and that's what matters.

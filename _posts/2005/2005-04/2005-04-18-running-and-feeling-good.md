I feel just a little bit smug this evening. I got in from work (remember, I cycle 3 miles home on a mountain bike), got changed, and went out for a run. Just to make myself feel much better, I ran an 8km route - which means I am can do the Marlow 5 that I've been arm-twisted into entering next month.

The last event I ran in was a 5K race at Waddesdon Manor last summer - since then I've not done anything really - apart from the odd training run.

This evening I was incredibly tired at about the half-way mark, and walked for a few seconds while I had a drink (I've bought one of those little hoop shaped bottles to carry when I run; with it being warm tonight I took it with me for the first time... apart from the continual sound of splashing water in the bottle, it wasn't a hindrance at all), but otherwise the thought that I would be really annoyed if I stopped kept me going through the last few kilometres.

I have only ever run the route in the early hours of the morning before, and I think I'll continue to do that when I can - running it in the evening was a bit of a nightmare... I started to daydream about how many trillion f*cking flies there must be along the riverbank. I guess thinking about that took my mind off feeling knackered though, which was probably a really good thing 

p.s. does anybody else that runs find that seeing other runners helps? - I can't help but make sure my form across the ground is good - and then if you are a little way behind somebody else who is out running, I find myself measuring now and again who is going faster (not that I'm going to try and catch them with my pathetic abilities).

Anyway - there you go... I am back running again and have snapped myself out of the motivational problems I was having. All I need now is some bodyglide... bloody shorts.

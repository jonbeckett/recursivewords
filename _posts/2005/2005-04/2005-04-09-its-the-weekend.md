It's the weekend, and finally we are getting some quality time to ourselves.

Yesterday I had to travel to Hastings to visit a client for work. I left the house at 6:55 yesterday morning, and got home at about 21:15. One of the longest working days in a while...

I got home, we ordered a chinese (a great company nearby deliver to your door), I did W's IVF injections, we watched TV for a bit, then went to bed... ever feel like you're on some kind of treadmill?

This morning we have been out working on the garden - the sun is out so it seemed like the sensible thing to do. I took some pics; I'll try and get them posted up later on.

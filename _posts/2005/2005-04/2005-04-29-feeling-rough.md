W had a bodyshop party at our house last night, so I went over to a friend's house with the Playstation and Gran Turismo. We sat, drank beer, and played Playstation for most of the evening.

Thinking about it now, we probably drank about 5 pints of beer each - and I know all about it now. Actually, I knew all about it at 7am this morning when I woke up and realised we had missed the refuge collectors (I heard them drive off). We now have the joyful prospect of a trip to the rubbish dump at the weekend with a car full of bin bags.

On another note, the water has been cut off at work today, so here I am with a hangover, I need a wee, and have to find out where the temporary toilet block is...

Arse!

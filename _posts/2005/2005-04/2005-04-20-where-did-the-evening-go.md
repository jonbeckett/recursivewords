I'm sat here typing this at 23:06 and wondering where on earth the evening went...

I got in, tidied the kitchen up, went and checked my mail, checked the news on the internet (I don't buy newspapers any more), W called me to eat dinner, then I went back and checked a few more things on the net... and here we are - it's virtually the end of the evening and I've not really done anything.

I did get a phone call earlier from a friend who's getting married asking if I'm free on Friday night to go out on the town with him. He's a fair bit older than me, and has only just moved to the area, so I'm guessing he has no friends locally to organise his stag night. I can empathise with that because I ended up organising my own stag night after my brother (who was supposed to be sorting it out) didn't organise anything.

Earlier today I discovered that another stag night I've been invited on is happening the night before the Marlow 5 running race. Its so annoying - here I am training to hopefully do okay in the race, and the night before I'm being asked out on a bender. At the moment I'm thinking I'll probably go for a drink in the evening with them, but not actually stick around for too long. I've not done all this training to piss it up the wall. The race starts at 9:30 on the Sunday morning...

We have the television on, and I have no idea why - neither of us is watching it. All that seems to be on is idiotic documentaries about the coming general election. Maybe I'll stick some music in my laptop and plug the headphones in.

This week quite a lot happened.

Earlier in the week (Tuesday?) I went to Westminster with some of the guys from work to start installing the live version of a system I have been working on for quite some time (an implementation of my CMS scripts 

Anyway - Wednesday was spent in London. On Thursday myself and my better half had to get up at 4:30am to go into the Nuffield Hospital in Slough for the crunch part of our IVF treatment. This is our second go at IVF; we had a go (unsuccessfully) late last year. W went into the operating theatre at about 8 in the morning for egg collection, and was back by about 10 - the hospital let her come home mid-afternoon.

The result of Wednesday came through on the phone this afternoon - apparently we have 4 fertilised eggs that are doing okay. We get another call in the morning to let us know how well the cells are dividing, and then (all being well) we will go back on Sunday to have two of them put back into W. Following that we cross our fingers for a couple of weeks.

The fertilisation success is the first good sign so far really - since it didn't work last year, we have been pretty pessimistic this time - I think we still are. It will be a huge dissappointment if it doesn't work, and will leave us in pretty serious debt if we have a third go this year, but we're trying not to think about that yet.

I guess if it does work, we're going to be in serious debt for the next 20 years, but then I guess we can put up with that 

To cap the week off I had to go back into Westminster (another six oclock start) today. Thankfully everything went like clockwork so I can relax a little about work.

Anyway - I'm absolutely knackered, so this is all I'm writing tonight.

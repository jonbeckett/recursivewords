This morning has so far been one of those mornings. One of those mornings where everything you try and do takes twice as long as it should because you keep discovering other things that need doing along the way.

I got up, had a wash, and then discovered I had no clean clothes. This is entirely my fault for not putting anything in the wash last night. I then remembered that I bought some bread last night, so started making sandwiches (which I had no time to make), and while planning to make them with peanut butter, found out we had run out of peanut butter. Following that I discovered ants walking across the lounge floor, and then walked to the shed to get my bike. On the way I thought "something feels different" - and realised I hadn't got my bike helmet or gloves on...

I finally arrived into work at 9:05 - only a few minutes late, but still late. I hate being late. Perhaps it's a hangup of mine - I always feel that the less ammunition I give people, the less they can have a go at me about. Having said that though, I had a bit of a surprise yesterday - I got a raise! I immediately took the cynical view that everybody has probably had a raise, and I was just out of the office when the original letters were handed out, but W told me to stop selling myself short. I bet everybody did get a raise though. If it's only one or two people being informed of anything they usually ask you to go down for a chat...

Anyway - I guess I better get on with my work. This morning so far has been spent replicating a database from a client site. What fun.

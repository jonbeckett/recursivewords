You know how you reach the end of some weeks, and are really looking forward to the weekend? (yes, I know... that's every week). This week was one of those weeks for me.

On Friday I had to go back into London to finish the installation of the system I've talked about a few times over the last few weeks. We finally hit most of the bugs on the head, and I don't think I need to go back again. I finally got back at about 5pm - my manager dropped me back to my house (he left his car at the train station, so I got a lift from him when we got back that far).

The news I was itching to hear at home was how the IVF fertilisation had gone - when I got in W was all smiles (I was dreading getting in and finding her in tears). Apparently all four eggs had fertilised. By the next morning we discovered that three of the four eggs had divided, and we had to go back in this morning for them to be put back into W.

Everything went well, and we are now crossing our fingers - in a couple of weeks time W has to have blood tests to tell us if she is pregnant or not. To be honest, following the dissappointments we have had in the past, I haven't really thought about having children at all yet - I'll deal with it when (and if) it happens.

Aside from all that, my brother and his family came over to visit yesterday afternoon and evening. My little nephew was somewhat awestruck that I have nearly completed Gran Turismo 4 on the Playstation... I think I might be the talk of the playground in an Oxfordshire primary school on Monday morning.

We went to the park in the afternoon and played frisbee, and bought some velcro mits for catching tennis balls... once we got my nephew to watch the ball and not shut his eyes as it appoached he made some pretty good catches.

Today (Sunday) has been very lazy indeed. Well... sort of lazy. We went to the clinic this morning, then to the garden centre to get all kinds of crap - bird feeders, grow bags, and so on. I think W bought them out of seeds. When we got back I cut the lawn, and since then I've been piddling around on the web - putting this blog solution up...

So there you go. I guess I should go and make something to eat in a bit.

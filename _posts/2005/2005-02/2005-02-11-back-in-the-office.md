After what seems like a marathon week, I am finally back in the office and doing development work on projects once again.

I'm looking forward to tonight because we're off to a chinese restaurant with friends 

Actually, the next few days are going to be pretty hectic... tonight we have the chinese meal... tomorrow we're probably off to see my cousin in Hospital, Sunday we've invited friends over for lunch, Monday night we're going out for a meal (it's Valentines!), then Tuesday we're been invited to another friends for a meal... it's all happeningto install CMS at a certain govt. department, Swindon (to visit a certain truck manufacturer), and inbetween have been thrashing away at a bug ridden solution for a business in Maidenhead...

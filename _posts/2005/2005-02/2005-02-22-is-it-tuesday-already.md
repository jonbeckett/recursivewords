This week seems to be going past even faster than last week (if that makes any sense at all).

Tonight I'm supposed to be going to the running club with a friend who has goaded me into it. I don't really want to go, but don't have an excuse not to go either. I know it will do me good, and I know I'll enjoy it when I get there... it's just getting there that's the problem (also, the prospect of running around the streets in the snow and ice isn't very appealing, it has to be said).

So... what am I up to today? I'm perparing stuff to go on-site at a client for three days to teach them the wonders of workflow programming. For those who have no idea what I'm talking about, workflows are probably right out there on the geeky end of IT projects; things that most big corporates have, but nobody knows are there. The kind of project you work for months on and everybody takes for granted 

I'm staying in a Holiday Inn hotel for the duration of the stay, just on the edge of Swindon. I spent last night at home filling my laptop with junk to keep me amused while I'm stuck in the hotel. I used to find it quite exciting going to stay in hotels, but then the novelty wears off, and you realise that you're away from your significant other, you have nothing to do, and you're going to (in all probability) eat alone every evening.

Ho hum... I guess I should be getting on with some work really

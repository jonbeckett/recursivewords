As promised, here are some pictures of the Eden project near St. Austell in Cornwall, UK

The Eden project is a public funded ecology research project to gather together as many plant species as possible, and using the latest technology, provide a home where those plants can live together, be protected, and be used for education and research.

The Eden Biomes

This is the view you get as you walk out of the "gate-house" into the complex. There are two main biomes so far - the big one is the "Humid Biome", and was about 44 degrees C while we were in there; enough to soak you with sweat while not doing anything. This simulates the climate in places like Malaysia and Indonesia - it's very strange walking around full grown palm trees indoors.

Inside a Biome

These pictures really give no idea of scale whatsoever. The biomes are absolutely enormous. You get some idea in this photo by looking up at the gantry in the sky - those are BIG gantries... it's kind of like being in the Truman Show stage.

Sculpture

The whole complex is littered with various sculptures inspired by various cultures working the land.

Fencing in the Hemp

Eden has the only legal plantation of hemp in the UK, and has a requirement to keep a fence around it - so they asked various artists to design panels - this is one of them. If you're wondering what the significance of hemp is, Marijuana is part of the hemp family.

The "Outdoor" Biome

The entire outside area of the project is considered a biome in itself - with plantations of various crops everywhere you look. It's amazing just to take in the sights and smells, and learn about the various plants.

Organic Structures

There are lots of organic structures in the outdoor biome, celebrating the use of various natural materials in the human world. This is a view through the roof of the "story house". I'm guessing they get classes of kids to sit under here at storytime on an evening.

The over-riding feeling while I was at the Eden Project was one of awe. It reminded me just how small and insignificant man is when compared to the whole "earth/planet machine". We are a part of a fantastically rich and diverse ecosystem - one that we have to respect, and should cherish. Being around the plants of the world, and the knowledge gained from them was such an enriching experience - it lifted me for hours afterwards.

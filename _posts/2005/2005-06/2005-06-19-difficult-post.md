I'm wondering if I should be writing this or not, but thought it's probably best - otherwise people will wonder if I've dissappeared off the face of the world or something.

We lost the baby.

Late on thursday night, the first signs showed up that something was wrong so I took her straight to casualty at Wycombe hospital. We were finally seen at about 2am, and told to come back in the morning for a scan.

The scan confirmed our worst fears - W was having a "mis-miscarriage". That basically means that the fetus had died several weeks earlier, but the pregnancy had carried on. Apparently one in four pregnancies end like this and quite often the mother has no idea; except of course we found out because we were going through IVF and knew she was pregnant from day one.

We were sent home on Friday morning to think about what we wanted to do - either let nature take it's course, or go back into hospital for a procedure to remove the remains of everything. Within an hour of arriving home, events overtook us. After a call to the hospital, I took us straight back and we were admitted to a ward immediately.

W was finally operated on at about 1am on Saturday morning. When she arrived back from theatre I left her to rest, and made my way home. I wanted to stay with her, but the nurses said that we both needed sleep. I guess at that point we had both been up for 36 hours.

On Saturday morning I got up and (while waiting for the hospital to call) cleaned the house. I basically went through everything removing any magazines and books about pregnancy and babies. The last thing I wanted W to be confronted with when she got home was all that stuff.

Yesterday afternoon I finally got the call at home to go and fetch her. Her Mum and Dad came over, picked me up, then went on to the hospital. We arrived back home at about 3pm.

We are both okay - although pretty fragile emotionally. Because I've been fussing around and looking after W, I've had more diversions to keep my mind off what has happened, which has been good in a way.

I've arranged to have the week off work to look after W, and will be taking her down to Cornwall to get away from everything later in the week - although I'll make a decision on that mid-week based on how W is.

I hope nobody that knows us ever has to go through anything like this. I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.

It's finally friday and I am looking forward to the weekend.

It's looking like the weather is going to be good, and there is a fun-fair in town We're inviting my brother and his family over to visit the park, eat lots of candy floss, then throw it back up on various rides. Knowing my little nephew, I will be pressed into service as a bumper-car driver, and plugged for funds to play various games that result in winning bows and arrows, furry creatures and various other rubbish.

Today I am sat at work wondering what to work on - I'm guessing (after being assigned to helpdesk for the next few weeks) that I should be trying to solve and close calls.

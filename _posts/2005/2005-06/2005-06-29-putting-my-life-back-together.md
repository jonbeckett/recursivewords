After a couple of weeks away from work following our loss of the baby (although it hadn't been born yet, we always thought of it as such), it feels somewhat like I'm piecing my life back together today. Getting up this morning, getting ready for work, arriving at the office and catching up with what has been happening has been strange.

It's also been a bit uncomfortable talking to people who know what happened - they don't like to raise the subject of how we are, and I'm not that happy talking about it yet either. I was telling a couple of the girls from the office the story of the last couple of weeks while we were stood outside at lunchtime, and I wobbled a bit while telling them. One of mine and W's tactics over the last couple of weeks has been to keep our mind occupied with anything other than what has happened. People might think to look at us that we have forgotten what's happened, but nothing could be further from the truth. It's with us in all the quiet moments, and probably will be for a long time to come.

So - today is all about "getting back on the bicycle". Getting on with things - and yet I'm finding it very hard to concentrate on much. You would think work would be a great distraction, but it isn't. I keep wandering off in my mind, and find myself sat here staring at the wall from time to time.

As my blog previously mentioned, we spent a long weekend in Cornwall with W's parents. We stayed at "Tregolls Farm" - about 9 miles southeast of Padstow. Originally we had planned to walk the "Saints Way" from Padstow (on the north coast) to Fowey (on the south coast) over the course of three days, but as a result of recent events we just went away for the chance to do just that - get away. The weather was kind to us, and we spent a few really good days wandering around cornish fishing villages, and managed to meet up with my parents while we were there too (although we nearly missed them - they have just arrived back from a sailing expedition to the Scilly Islands on my Dad's yacht "Nell").

The hilight of the trip was a visit to the "Eden Project" near St Austell. It's fast becoming one of the most popular and important sites in the UK for people to visit - essentially doubling up as both a research and educational base for all things green. I'll be posting a load of pictures of our visit in the blog in the coming days. To give you some idea, the "Humid" biome was 44 centigrade inside - god knows what that is in Farenheit.

I suppose I better get on with some work.

Today has been one of those days. It is now just gone 4pm, and I have hardly had time to think all day. I have been covering helpdesk for the last few weeks (luckily, I think I finish my stint on 1st line support at the end of next week, and go back to being a full-time developer).

Helpdesk is a weird role; some days you're scratching around for things to do, other days you're run off your feet.

Role on 5:30pm and hometime.

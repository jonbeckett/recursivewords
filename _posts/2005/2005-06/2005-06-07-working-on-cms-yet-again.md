I have a meeting later in the week with a BIG company to look at using my CMS code for their intranet, and later for their public internet site. It's been said that the IT budget they had for their last stab at this was about 200,000.

Therefore tonight I have resumed working on the code, and started writing the "Feeds" code, that I have been putting off for ages. I originally wrote my content management system to make it easier for me to manage my own sites - but as it developed, people have started using it in the real world; and the real world has users who know nothing about software development.

Also, I realised that sites made of chunks of content are not enough. You also need to be able to handle things like "serialised content" easily. By this, I mean news feeds - and (you've guessed it) RSS. The problem with this whole thing is that adding news feeds to the site is not a simple undertaking. At the moment the "engine" understands pages, content, templates and documents. The biggest chunk of all the programming is the relationship between "pages" and "content" - perhaps 60% of all the code. Now understand that the feeds system is bigger than the content system... MAJOR undertaking. I'm basically looking at writing upwards of 10,000 lines of code to get the feeds up and running.

I was hoping to get the programming done in time for thursday, but after designing the database tables and starting to put the code together I can confidently say there is a snowball's chance in hell that I will be ready any time this month even. Feeds are a big deal.

Oh well...

I've written far too many geeky entries recently. It's time I wrote something about myself. Maybe later.

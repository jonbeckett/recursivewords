We're leaving for a few days in the morning to go and spend a few quiet days in Cornwall. We're there from Thursday through till Monday.

We've spent most of this week pretty much hiding at home, and trying to avoid the world in general. Both myself and W have found the best way of dealing with what's happened is to not think about it. Strangely, when visitors do come by it's more difficult - because they want to know how we are, and that usually involves going back over the story.

I'm just glad that W appears to be physically okay (so far). I have to keep an eye on her for the next few days, and be ready to run back from work next week if she gets any cramps or anything.

The trip to cornwall was originally going to be a hike from the north coast to the south coast over the period of three days (Friday to Sunday), but since our world tried to fall apart, we've decided to still go, but not do the hike. I'm guessing the trip will consist of visits to villages, small walks, and lots of resting in tea shops, book shops, galleries, museums, and such like.

I've spent most of today ironing clothes, washing stuff, and generally keeping busy. This afternoon I had half an eye on the chess match taking place between GM Michael Adams and the new chess computer "Hydra". It's interesting from a research perspective; Hydra is 32 computers working in parallel, each with "field programmable gate array" hardware on-board to help do the chess playing calculations. The second game (today) ended in a draw - which is pretty amazing for Adams to achieve.

Anyway - I guess I better go finish packing stuff for tomorrow. I'll have a 4 hour drive in the morning... what fun. It'll be worth it though just to get W away from here for a bit.

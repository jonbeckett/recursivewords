I have finally hit a patch of calm at work, after several days working on all kinds of thingsmost of them not involving development.

Yesterday was spent talking to a company a few miles away about doing some web development for them (probably in C#, which will be interestingalthough I've played with .

NET I have not used it for an entire project yet). Today was spent showing the Co-op (a huge retail chain in the UK) my CMS engine, and the integration within it to OpenText Livelink that one of the guys here wrote.

On top of that, one of the ladies that works downstairs grabbed me on the stairs earlier and offered some web work to me "on the side"she used to do web design, but doesn't have time any more. I gave her the standard adviceif she deals with the client (who has come to her), I can do the coding and give the result to hertherefore she makes a cut and everybody's happy.

Finally, late this afternoon I wandered into the kitchen and was talking to one of the guys from our sister companythey are currently thinking about extending their websiteso they want to talk to me about CMS too.

It's all happening!

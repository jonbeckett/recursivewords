While kicking around the house looking for something to do this afternoon I ended up wandering around with the digital camera. What follows is the result of a wander around the house and the back garden...

While walking out towards the garden, I looked in across the living room and caught my other half concentrating on something on the internet (yes, we are a geeky household with wireless internet etc..)

Tree bark on our old Apple Tree. As far as we know the tree is about 70 years old, and at some point in the past has been left for many years without pruning - hence it now being about 25ft tall.

Blossom on the old apple tree. Apparently these apple trees were here in an orchard on the site the houses were built in the 1930s.

Chess pieces in the sun. Okay - so this isn't something I found, it's something I put out in the sunshine to take a photograph of. Looks nice though, so I included it.

Chrome Thing

Another thing I put out in the sunshine to see how it would look. I have no idea what it really is - my brother bought it me for christmas many years ago.

Dandelions in the flower bed. I could claim there was some artistic reasoning behind this picture, but the reality was based more in "I wonder how close the macro works on this camera?"

Rhodedendrons. I just asked W what "those white flowers are over there?" - and was reliably informed they are rhodedendrons. Hope I spelled that correctly.

Nettles. We cut these back two weeks ago, and they are two feet high again. Thousands of them. Damn.

Winchime. We have an old wooden windchime in the trees at the far end of the garden. It makes strange "tocking" noises, and wind sings in the bamboo tubes.

So there you go - some photos from my life, taken on Monday 2nd May 2005. Feel free to leave comments, and I'll go look at your websites and/or blogs in return

I just had a dig around up in the loft and turned up another old drawing book from the 1990's

This one has bits and bobs of cartoon stuff in among notes from meetings, and other stuff to to with work at the time.

Learning Manga

This pic was probably my first go at drawing manga style girls.

Manga Girl with Light

This was probably my second go at Manga...

Sleeping Experiment

A line drawing of somebody asleep - playing a game with the pen to see what it would look like with only one direction of line.

Tank Girl Style

This must be from around the time Tank Girl became popular, judging from the style. I still love Jamie Hewlett's artwork now.

Bond Girl

Very much more "American" style comic artwork - a bond girlie type thing that I probably sat and drew while killing time one day.

Feel free to comment on any of them!

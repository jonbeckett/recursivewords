The image below was taken at the Jardin de Luxembourg in Paris, where people gather to play chess in the park. For me, the picture catches the moment wonderfully - anybody who plays chess knows the game is filled with imperfect knowledge - you never really know the full outcome of your actions until the game unfolds.

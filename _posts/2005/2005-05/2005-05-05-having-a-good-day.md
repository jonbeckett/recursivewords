This morning I went for a run with a friend - "G" - who is just starting out. We went for about a 2k run down to the edge of town and back just for him to find out how he felt. I deliberately went slow and tried to enforce on him the idea that you go slow enough to hold a conversation, and if you feel knackered, just slow it down even more.

G admitted that had I not been there he would have gone off way faster and probably had to walk back - whereas running at the pace I pulled him back to (about 10 minute miles), he kept going fine and didn't start coughing or anything. We agreed as he finished his stint that we'll go out again early next week and see how it goes - maybe run for a bit longer if he can.

After I left G I crossed town back to my normal training route and thought "I'll just see if I can find a route that takes me about 45 minutes" - with the idea that running for that long would prepare me for the Marlow 5 race this coming Sunday. I ended up feeling okay and crossed the park and followed the river on my "normal" route. This little voice in the back of my head kept saying "you know, if you manage to run your normal route on top of what you've already done this morning, that's probably 10k". I think it was that thought that got me through the last couple of kilometres. I could so easily have stopped - and had a couple of twinges in my stomach at one point, but pressed on and am really chuffed to have done it.

I now feel (with a fair amount of confidence) that I am ready for the Marlow 5 on Sunday. I can run the distance and then some. I don't think I'll run between now and Sunday - I need to give my legs a chance to recover. I'm not sure if I've ever written in my journal about it, but I have to wear orthotics because I have flat feet - and was a bit worried while out running today that I had a bit of pain in the sides of my ankle. I'll have to wait a couple of days to see if my shins hurt I guess.

Anyway - better get on with some work!

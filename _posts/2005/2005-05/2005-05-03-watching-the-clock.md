I'm at work this afternoon, and find myself watching the clock. We went to the clinic early this morning for W to have a blood test - by 4pm this afternoon we will know if the IVF treatment has worked or not. The call could come anywhere between 3pm and 4pm from the clinic, and should tell us if we have a chance of being parents or not.

While we are keeping all our fingers crossed, we know that the success rate of IVF is very low - so even though this is our second attempt at it, there is only something like a one in 5 chance that it will work.

It's a strange situation to be in today - while I am hoping it will be successful, I'm almost expecting it won't be. I don't know why. I guess if we are successful, I'll look back on this posting with a wry grin.

It's the end of my lunch break and I'm back working on the same stuff I have been picking at for the last couple of days. It's essentially a "plugin" for the PluggedOut CMS scripts that allow PDF files to be checked into the document repository and content indexed. In laymans terms, it means the text that appears in the PDF can then be searched.

Alongside that, I have the work website to pick away at, and heard from a salesman this morning that an old project has re-awoken with them wanting a demo of PluggedOut CMS.

I just finished playing chess against a colleague - we regularly play at lunchtime just to get away from the computer screens; I'm starting to feel a bit sorry for him - I keep walloping him every time we play. The second game today was particularly embarrassing for him; the game only lasted about 20 moves before I got checkmate.

Anyway... guess I should be getting on with some coding.

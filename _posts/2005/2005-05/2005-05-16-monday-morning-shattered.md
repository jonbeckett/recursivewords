It's 11:28 on Monday morning and I'm having a break from my work for a minute or two to write in my Blog.

I'm shattered already this morning. I was up at 6am and out of the house at 6:30 to go running.

This whole weekend was a bit of a slog, to be honest - not that I'm complaining about it because we did some good stuff. On Friday night after work we went over to visit some friends for a chinese, then on Saturday morning I was up at 6 to go running. The rest of Saturday was taken up with gardening - I had to dig some hole to sink posts into the end of the garden - W is planning on growing climbing plants over a wire frame to give us some privacy at the back of the garden.

On Saturday afternoon W's brother came over and we went for a meal in the evening at the Three Horseshoes. I didn't know this was all planned until after I had invited my brother and his family over - so had to call them and re-arrange. Sunday was pretty much taken over with a visit to my in-laws for lunch. I don't mind going over there, but I get a bit bored sometimes. I went and bought a stack of magazines to keep me busy.

We were talking about these stupid "Sudoku" puzzles that are appearing everywhere - my brother in law challenged me to complete the one I had in my newspaper... it took about 5 or 6 minutes from start to finish. I'm not sure if I've just been doing easy ones, or if programmers just have a knack for problem solving. Strangely, I'm rubbish at crosswords though. Perhaps my word power isn't very good.

We got home at about 8pm last night, and by the time we'd checked our e-mail and tidied up a bit, that was the end of the weekend...

This morning (as I said at the start of this post), I was up at 6 again to go running. I did the 2 mile lap of town with G and J, and after leaving them, continued on to do an extra couple of miles. On the final mile I thought "I wonder how fast I can go?", and picked up the pace - I was pretty surprised to find that I could continue on with that level of effort for quite some time.

Following the run this morning I had to go and root around in the loft for my old tennis racket - I've agreed to go and play tennis with one of the guys from work today. I don't know that I'm going to be much use - I'm pretty knackered from running still. That fast mile really took it out of me.

So there you - go. I'm sat here at work feeling distinctly second hand, and wondering where I'm going to summon the energy from to swing a tennis racket.

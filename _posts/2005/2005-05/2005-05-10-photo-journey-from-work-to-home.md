I thought it might be fun to do a "photo-journey" from work to home - so those outside of the UK can perhaps see what a typical town is like. Most of the pictures were taken from my mountain bike while cycling one handed - so I apologise in advance for the quality (or lack of).

Leaving the Office

Yes, this really is my desk in the office I work at. If I turned the camera around you would see all kinds of servers and stuff in pieces.

On the Bike

I ride a mountain bike about 3 miles each way to work each day. Sorry I'm not a very good aim with the camera.

Harleyford

The office is in the Harleyford Estate, on the outskirts of Marlow.

Looking Back

As we approach the edge of the estate, I look back towards the offices.

Leaving Harleyford

This is the track that leaves the estate to the east.

On the Towpath

I have no idea why this is called a towpath, because there is no river near it - the river is about half a mile to the south...

Henley Road - into Townget a clear run.

Court Garden

Past the Court Garden roundabout, and passing Higginson Park - where such wonders as the bronze statue of Steve Redgrave hide.

Station Road

Skipping past the town centre, it's straight into Station Road (which has a railway station on it, funnily enough).

Newtown Road

Leaving the victorian part of Marlow behind, we turn onto Newtown Road, and are nearing home.

Newfield Gardens Here We Come!

Just a few corners from home now - into a rabbit warren of small suburban roads.

Approaching Newfield Gardens

Nearly there - you can see the green in the distance.

Newfield Gardens

Rolling towards home (the house to the left of the tree in the centre).

Our House!

Down the drive, and cycle straight down the alleyway at the side.

Into the Garden

Okay - I'm off the bike now, and pushing it towards the shed.

See you tomorrow...

The bike is put away until 8:30am tomorrow morning.

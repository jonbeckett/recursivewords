I really can't figure the world out sometimes. I posted to the linux community on LiveJournal earlier about my CMS project, and rather than getting other open source developers having a look and giving constructive comment, the people that have looked have been hostile...

I don't understand it... people who are interested in Linux but openly question open source projects.

Amazing.

Myself and a colleague went and played Tennis at lunchtime today - it's the first time I have played in about 7 or maybe even 8 years, and it was a bit of a shock - just getting the ball back was difficult.

Isn't it strange how when you are young, you can just "do" things, and when you get older your coordination is nowhere near as fluent.

We played on the courts at Bisham Abbey (it's pronounced "Bissam", by the way) , and I think we came out more or less even. I probably did better overall, but was nowhere near as adventurous - I won most games by virtue of getting the ball back. We had a few good rallies that ran to six or seven shots, but they were the exception rather than the rule.

For those who don't live in the UK, Bisham Abbey is where the likes of Tim Henman, Greg Ruzedski and the England football and rugby teams train. You can usually find a gaggle of papparazi waiting around the gates when anything interesting in the sports world is about to happen.

So - I'm back in the office this afternoon and really am knocked out now. I could do with a couple of hours sleep...

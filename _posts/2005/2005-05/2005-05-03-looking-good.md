I had a text message on my phone from W at 4:30pm, with the word "woohoo!" in it. I called home immediately and got a very tearful W on the other end of the phone with the best news we've ever had.

The post IVF blood tests came back overwhelmingly positive. W is already a day late, and apparently the hormone levels in the blood test have made the hospital suspect that W is pregnant with twins.

We have to try to keep our feet on the ground for the next few weeks - it can still go either way - but it's hard to resist the thought that in 9 months time I might be a Dad!

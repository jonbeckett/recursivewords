It's 3pm now on Sunday, and I have just finished watching the Spanish F1 Grand Prix. Michael Schumacher's Ferrari didn't finish the race because it ate it's tyres (or, more correctly, the idiot driver pushed the car way too hard on tyres that were already cooked). Myself and my father-in-law cheered with gusto as events unfolded. It's also a shot in the eye for the FIA who banned BAR this week in an obvious attempt to give Ferrari more of a chance.

Anyway - I digress. The title of this entry is "Ran the Marlow 5", mainly because that's exactly what I did this morning. The Marlow 5 is a five mile running race around the streets of my home town, and is held every year. I didn't do it last year because bascially I didn't train for it, but this year I've been going out running fairly regularly (read : once or twice a week), so thought I should probably enter.

I'm not sure what my result was - just over 50 minutes I think - but I didn't put any real effort in at all. I jogged around the course and within half a minute of going over the finish line I was absolutely fine. Half the reason I chose to not try was because it was so hot - for the first couple of miles it was so hot I thought I might get into trouble, but a breeze blew up and it got much cooler towards the end.

Leaving the start line I was absolutely shocked after about 200 yards to find some people walking. Mind you - I was in no mood to go overtaking loads of people, and took the first couple of miles really easily. It took about a minute or so to get over the start line too, but I didn't even look at my watch on the way round - it was only an afterthought as I reached the finish that I looked up at the clock.

You might wonder why I bothered running it if I wasn't going to try... I ran the Marlow 5 a few years ago, and ended up walking for about a mile of the course; mainly because I was unfit  Bizarrely, I did it faster with walking back then than this time when I just jogged round.

Anyway - I completed my goal for today - I ran round the course without walking

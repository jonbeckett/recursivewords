Hmmm... "Saturday Morning - Feeling Groovy". Reminds me of the Simon and Garfunkel tune. I guess it sums up my mood this morning though.

I was up at 7 this morning and out of the house to go running with G and a new running partner "J". Apparently J is doing a half marathon in September; so he's coming out with us on our early morning runs around town. We only did a couple of miles around town this morning (I'm helping get their distance up), but it was still good just to get out on the quiet early morning roads and "run". It's weird - until you've been in the situation of being fit enough to just "run", and find yourself out on quiet roads or countryside - it's hard to explain how it feels. I guess a religious person would claim it "fills your soul" or something. I think it's just good to get away from everything sometimes.

So - here I am sitting here having a cup of tea in my housecoat and IT'S THE WEEKEND! I think we have plans today to go buy some posts for the garden and put them in - then I've been informed we are going out for something to eat this evening. Tomorrow we have been invited over to W's parent's for sunday dinner.

My weekends tend to be like this - I've pretty much given up on having my own plans, because I get informed what we're going to be doing as the weekend arrives. I guess now we have children on the way, any concept of having plans for what I want to do is going to dissappear - not that I'm complaining about that. Everything changes.

I guess I better go and clear the kitchen up a bit...

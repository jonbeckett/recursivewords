Here's a couple more drawings from the far distant past when I used to make time to sit and draw.

Nude Woman

Drawn from some magazine (FHM or Loaded most probably) in 1996 - around the same time that I went back and started an art night class - which I was immediately alienated from because of the gulf in ability between myself and everybody else there.

Man Wearing Glasses

A drawing this time of some guy wearing glasses - basically because I had never drawn anybody wearing glasses before and wondered how difficult it might be. I think it was an advert in a magazine for some make of glasses - maybe Dolce & Gabanna (sp?).

I'm sat here wondering what to write about, and I can't really think of anything. Perhaps if I put some music on, inspiration might strike.

(pause while I run "WinAmp")

Okay - I'm listening to the "Book of Kells" by Iona. If you have never heard of them, go check them out - although you might have to search around on the Internet to find them. They are a bit like Clannad, but much less pretentious.

Today has been a quiet day, and filled with time to think. Sometimes quiet days are good.

While walking around town yesterday with W, I noticed that the new Harry Potter book is on sale (I mentioned it in an entry yesterday) - and I decided when I saw it that I'm not bothering with it yet for two reasons - firstly, I haven't finished the books I want to read, and secondly, I'm not that big a fan of the Harry Potter books. I've read them all so far, but really struggled to get through the last one.

I've been looking around our bookshelves at home to see what books I haven't read - we picked up a copy of the Illiad a while ago, and I've still only looked briefly at it. I think it's going to be the kind of book you need to get into - adapt the the written style (it's written in prose) before you can really soak it up.

I feel like I need to read books that are not on the bestseller lists. If the music chart is anything to go by, a huge part of me believes that there are many, many great books and great albums that nobody has taken any notice of. I guess I must be turning into an anarchist of some description.

It adds up, doesn't it - I'm tending more and more towards atheism, I find myself opposing people's views more often than not (although I usually keep my opinions to myself to avoid confrontation), and I'm actively seeking independent musicians and writers to entertain me.

Perhaps none of these things are necessarily bad. Perhaps I am just more objective than most. Perhaps my enquiring mind is getting the better of the "accepted views" that we are all expected to have.

Hmmm. Deep thoughts for a Sunday night.

I'm in something of a quandary. My better half arrived home tonight with a present for me - the new Harry Potter book.

Actually it makes me feel a bit guilty - W is always buying me presents, and I never think to get her things (he says, having bought her a new CD player for her car). I guess I need to try a bit harder with silly little things now and again.

Anyway - I now have the new Harry Potter book (Tescos were selling it on offer), but I am hardly started reading The Chronicles of Narnia. There is a temptation to read the Harry Potter book before too many people let too much slip about it, but at the same time the dogmatic element in me says "finish Narnia".

I think I will read Narnia first, and then Potter, but it raises the question - when am I going to read something a bit more substatial?

So there's the question - what recommendations do people have for books worth reading once I've got these children's titles out of the way? This is going to sound strange, but I wouldn't mind reading something polarised from the childrens books - something a bit grimy, a bit dark, maybe even a bit naughty.

Suggestions?

I'm sat here wondering if I should order the new Harry Potter book from Amazon yet, or wait until I've finished reading the book I am currently reading.

I don't know what to do. My sensible self tells me that I should just get through both the book I am currently reading, and the long list of books that I've been wanting to read for ages before even thinking about the next Harry Potter book.

This is probably going to sound like heresy, but I thought the last Potter book wasn't that great. I probably enjoyed "The Goblet of Fire" the most, but when you compare any of the books to anything like "Jonathan Strange", "His Dark Materials", or even "The Chronicles of Narnia", you realise how poorly written the Harry Potter books are. At least I did.

So... the question remains - do I just go and buy the book and add it to my growing stack of unread books, or do I wait.

Hmmmmm.

It's Friday, things are slowing down, and I find myself sorting little details out here and there.

My heart hasn't really been in my work this week - I keep daydreaming. When I first came back to the office on Tuesday I was conscious of just keeping going - making sure I didn't start thinking "why bother". Looking back after only a few days, part of the reason for not wanting to come back was probably facing people. In a strange way, losing the baby wasn't so difficult for myself and W to deal with - it was somehow more difficult to tell others. Throughout the week I've more or less got over that hurdle. People have been coming up to visit me at my desk from time to time passing on their concern that we are okay. I was a bit surprised yesterday for the MD (CEO for those of you in the US) to come and sit on the corner of my desk and have a chat about it all.

Today most of my work has centred around managing the open helpdesk calls, and logging my time spent on them into the HR system. We find ourselves managing the helpdesk calls in Siebel, recording time in a bespoke section of OpenText Livelink, and then recording AGAIN in another section of OpenText Livelink... and we're SUPPOSED to be system integrators (i.e. we make it easy for other companies to do this stuff).

Ah well... better get on.

It's getting pretty late now, and I'm looking forward to putting a pretty crap day behind me.

Professionally it was a good day - I was in communication with one of our major clients throughout the day to organise development work. They seemed to appreciate having somebody on the end of the phone that understood where they are coming from, and what they need. The company I work for seem to forget I used to be the IT manager for a big manufacturing company, so have a load of skills related to that which go completely unused now.

This evening I worked on my blog script and wrapped up a new build for people to download. It's still not feature complete, or documented well enough, but it's useable. I'm hoping people will start to download it and use it now.

Tomorrow night we are going out for a meal  On the 29th July, 5 years ago I met a girl in a bar in Oxford at lunchtime for a drink. The rest is history

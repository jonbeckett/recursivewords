You know there is a saying "I thought I'd seen everything but..." - well now I have.

Glow in the Dark Pebbles

Yes - the title of the link above is not a mistake. You can buy "glow in the dark" pebbles to put in your garden. What the feck ? Who thought of that? I guess we did have glow-in-the-dark socks in the 1980s though...

Many years ago my uncle gave my brother and I watches for christmas with glow-in-the-dark faces. This was before the laws came in regulating how much radium they could use in the coating; I swear we could read books under the bedclothes by the light from those watchfaces.

Anyway - glowing fecking pebbles. Unbelievable.

It's official. I have the weirdest dreams.

I woke up with my alarm this morning at 7am, switched it off, and promptly fell asleep again - like I do every morning. What happened between 7am and 7:45am must rank as one of the strangest yet wonderful and weird dreams I have ever had.

It only comes to mind because I have just been telling a good friend about it - and thought others might enjoy laughing at me while reading about it.

I can only remember bits and pieces of the dream now (isn't it weird how dreams are like that).

I remember a magical pirate ship, and being chased by some Captain Hook type figure towards the ship. The ship was inside some kind of cavern/hangar place. As I got near the deck, the entire ship tipped over towards me to let me walk straight onto the deck.

Once on-board the ship got under-way and we went out into a cove in front of a beach... only now I am standing on the beach, and trying to get into a rowing boat in order to reach the ship.

Two ships crew wade through the water ahead of me to help fetch the rowing boat, and once in, one of them starts swimming in front of the boat, pulling it along with his arm hooked over the prow. Only he's swimming as fast as if it had been a motorboat... and while swimming he is dicussing with me what computer games he likes. I also remember that he had a sliding puzzle in the surface of his forearm, except all the little sliding squares are gloss black.

Weird.

Another part of the dream I remember involved myself and W being in a huge marble floored "magic" department store of some kind (I have no idea what gave the impression it was magic) - it was decked out in harlequin colours. We were looking at huge chess pieces. I put one of them down onto a huge board set into the floor, and when placed on the dark squares, the piece became translucent - exposing liquid inside that started to boil...

And that's when I woke up!

Now is that damn weird or what?

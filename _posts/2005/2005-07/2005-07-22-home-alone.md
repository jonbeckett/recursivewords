W has gone to Crystal Palace (stadium in London) to watch the Athletics with her mum tonight. I was worried that a lot of the big names were going to pull out because of the bombing attempts in London recently, but there were still quite a few in the end. The like of Justin Gatland and Asafa Boldon turned up.

Perhaps memorably, Yelena Isinbayeva got a new pole vault world record - she became the first woman to vault over 5 metres. I was watching it on the TV when she did it - it's not fair really is it - she's probably the most gifted natural female athlete ever, she's stunningly beautiful, and she seems really nice too.

So - here I sit with a glass of wine, eating pizza and typing an entry into my blog. I'm just deciding which computer game to play (Halo? Forza? Jak & Daxter? Ratchet and Clank? Gran Turismo?), and what music to put on.

I thought I was going to be in trouble because W had ordered shopping to be delivered this evening - only I couldn't remember what time window she specified. I got in at about 18:05 tonight, and there was no sign of the shopping at 20:30... I had kind of resigned myself to having missed it when the doorbell went. We now have full cupboards, a full fridge, and loads of goodies. Smoothies, fruit juice, nice bread, olives, cheese, nice rices, cus cus (sp?), several bottles of wine, lager, and lots more.

I guess I could go and make a start on the Harry Potter books (as I type this, the be-halo'd one on my shoulder says "no - finish Narnia!").

We shall see...

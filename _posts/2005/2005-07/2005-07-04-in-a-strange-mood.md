I'm in a pretty strange mood today - the helpdesk at work was pretty busy this morning (Monday morning - nothing unusual there), but things have quietened down now. It leaves me sat here wondering what to get on with. I can't do any serious development work because if anything does come in, I have to drop it.

I find myself reading my blog, and messing around with the Nexus community website that I built some time ago. If you have never seen or heard of it, please help me to promote it - it's effectively a penpals website - where people can put their details in and send messages back and forth SECURELY. It has it's own "message system" so it keeps your email address secret.

I was playing around with the "CamFrog" communications software late last night, and was amazed at how many people are using it these days. It was quite a shock. After spending perhaps an hour messing around with it I made friends with one fairly normal person - which is perhaps something of a damning indication of the number of idiots on the internet. The start to most "CamFrog" conversations seems to consist of somebody who can barely speak English going through each of the women who happen to be in a forum asking "xxxx - you are hot - see breasts please"... or something to that affect. If they have no luck they then move on to the next person, and when they run out they move on to the next forum. Bear in mind that this seems to be the NORM. Unbelievable. It was quite funny though to see it going on though.

I guess I could fill this afternoon by surfing the latest posts on LiveJournal.

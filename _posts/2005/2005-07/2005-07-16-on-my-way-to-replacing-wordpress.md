Hi all,

I am well on my way now to replacing WordPress as my blog/diary/journal script. I'm not entirely sure why I'm doing it (probably because I can), but I'm re-writing my own blog script. The main reason may well be that I was not happy with the way my old blog script was designed. I never really thought it through - I just built it to do a job one day.

If I remember correctly, my original Blog script was written in the space of one lunchtime at work, and slowly grew from there. Thinking way back, it started out written in ASP, and then at some point got re-written in PHP... again, it would have been done during a lunchtime 

The second version of the Blog script marks a pretty big departure in how the programming is constructed - this time there is a solid layout within the programming files, and should serve as a good starting point for other developers to realise how web projects should be built.

At the moment I'm just getting the basic functionality working - but following that I will clean the code up, write an "installer" for the project, and do some documentation (probably just an FAQ).

The big opportunity for the new blogging script is for people to create their own themes relatively easily (I've made sure the theme system is very easy indeed to understand). A little later in the year I'm going to look at running a theme competition on the Pluggedout webspace for people to submit themes they have made.

It's all going to be rather good fun.

Anyway - I have to go and visit the post office.

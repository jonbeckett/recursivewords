Following a few defeats against a friend at work recently I decided it's time I started putting some work into playing chess once more. I have Chessmaster up and running on my home computer and had a "proper" game against it tonight.

I started okay, but lost my way on the way out of the opening, and got into serious trouble. Thankfully the computer made a mistake late on and I capitalised. I managed to weather the early storm from the computer, but at the expense of time. My last 10 moves were made within about 10 seconds

Here's the PGN of the game (you can load PGN data into most chess software to view the game).

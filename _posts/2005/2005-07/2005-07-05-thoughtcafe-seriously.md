Once upon a time I built a website for amateur writers to post their writing, and get feedback on it. The website became far too successful for it's own good, and in the end started to dominate mine and W's lives.

A couple of years on from the site shutting down, more and more of the old TC members have approached me asking if I would ever consider doing another writing site. We knew we had a good site, but we had no idea how highly regarded it was. While talking to an ex-thoughtcafe member earlier today, I decided it's about time I did something about it.

I have setup a page on my webspace for people who would like to see ThoughtCafe rise from the flames to post their thoughts and comments. Feel free to visit the URL below and add your two penneth.

I've made it clear that nothing will happen unless enough people are interested. I'll look forward to seeing what the response is over the next few weeks...

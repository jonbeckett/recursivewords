I've just read something that has really upset me and made me incredibly angry.

Click here to read about it...

In the UK version of "Big Brother" (unbelievably it is into it's 6th series and hasn't been cancelled yet), the producers have given the freaks in the house a kitten to play with.

Can you believe it. If you search for the story on Google you'll probably dredge up pictures of the kitten in the house - the poor thing is absolutely petrified. They have most likely traumatised the poor animal for life.

It's fine letting willing people go into something like "Big Brother" - they are doing it of their own free will, but there is NO WAY animals should be subjected to the freaks that take part.

I really hope they take the production company to court and get the programme taken off the air.

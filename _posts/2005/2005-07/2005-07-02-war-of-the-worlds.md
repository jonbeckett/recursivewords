We just got back from the cinema after going to see "War of the Worlds" - the new Stephen Spielberg movie.

We never really take much notice of the press at home - usually only reading the main news coverage, and taking pretty much everything else with a pinch of salt (do people use that idiom outside of the UK?).

Anyway - over the last few weeks we had started to hear ominous things from those in the media shouting loudly enough for us to get wind of that "War of the Worlds" wasn't that great...

Forget anything the media has said about "War of the Worlds". It's by far the best movie we have seen this year - and yes, that includes the final Star Wars movie. I was a bit worried it would be a bit crap after finding out they had changed the story (in typical American fashion), but my fears were unfounded.

"War of the Worlds" is at turns frightening, scary, sad, and uplifting. I'm not going to ruin it for people that haven't seen it by describing scenes from the movie - you'll have to go and see it yourself.

I urge you to see the movie at the cinema. This kind of movie will not work anywhere near as well on the small screen. In the same way as the LOTR movies worked better on a big screen, this does too.

Fan-bloody-tastic.

After a couple of months playing around with WordPress, I have gone back to my own blog script because I can do what I like with it - rather than be constrained by what the writers of WordPress would like me to do with it.

What you see here now is the product of a chunk of programming that took a few evenings this week to knock together. It's still nowhere near finished, but it's good enough to run my Blog 

While attempting to put this in place I had to figure out a means of migrating my old blog entries from WordPress back to here, so hopefully that might come in useful for others too. I didn't bother moving the comments while I was at it - but then who reads old blog comments anyway ?

While sat here drinking my coffee, I realised there have been quite a few things over the last week or so that I have been distinctly unhappy about - and in the most part they have nothing to do with me, and everything to do with society in general. I also realised that I haven't had a rant for ages.

Why do people (in general) have no consideration for anybody else? Why do people (in general) think that what they are doing is far more important that what anybody else is doing?

Each morning on the way into and from work on my bike, so many things happen that they have become normal. People walking out in front of me. People pulling up alongside me at junctions with no regard to which direction I might have been going. People walking straight into the street in front of traffic to make the traffic stop for them. People pushing out of road ends into traffic. People pushing into queues at supermarkets. People starting to put their stuff through the counter at supermarkets before you've finished packing your own stuff.

And you know the worst ones? People who treat me like I'm invisible. This happens most commonly when traffic is passing parked cars on the wrong side of the road - if you happen to be riding a bike in the opposite direction (on the right side of the road for yourself) you may as well be the invisible fcking man. Quite often the only answer is to get off the bike and onto the path before you get run fcking down.

The same happens when I'm walking into town. Groups of people walk towards me, and they never give way - it's always me who walks into the road, or has to dodge around people who have absolutely no regard for the rest of the world because they are so absorbed in their own selfish little self interested world.

People who say sorry and don't mean it at all. There's a big difference between saying it and meaning it.

Racists. There are so many damn racist people around, and if you say anything the finger will be pointed at you for being some kind of Judas figure. The really funny thing is that the most prejudiced/bigotted people are usually those who like to portray themselves as being exactly the opposite. Of course, their facade slips now and again and you see their true colours, but of course you're not expected to pull them up for anything because that would be scandalous.

Of course the idiotic people of this world have no idea that the quiet people who just go about their daily lives trying not to cause offence, and trying to think of others and make the world a little bit better place end up just getting bitter seeing all the crap going on around them.

I'll stop ranting now.

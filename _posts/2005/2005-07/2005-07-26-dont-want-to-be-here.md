I'm sat here at work this morning, and I really don't want to be here at all. I'm fed up with working here.

We do the same old crap all the time. The same old issues crop up all the time, and particular people are starting to really wind me up - people who I thought were good friends.

Perhaps it's just me.

I want to be doing web development, and here I am picking away at the recognition engine of some half-boiled OCR technology to get it to read the numbers on the bottom of invoices correctly. How exciting is that.

Bah Humbug.

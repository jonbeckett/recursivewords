It's the end of a pretty long and boring day today. My spirits seem to be a bit up-and-down recently. Yesterday I had a great day - and although I didn't really do much different today, it seemed much more difficult to remain motivated.

I feel like I should be writing much more thoughtful and interesting entries into my blog, but the trouble is that I only tend to sit down and write entries when I am either fed up, or tired. If I have energy, I'm usually off doing other things away from the computer - like helping in the garden, or tidying the house up. Doesn't my life sound exciting.

Work today was okay, but like I said - very hum-drum. I really am becoming more cynical by the day though - there were a couple of times today at work that I found myself opposing the views of other people in the office (all of them good friends) and I had to bite my tongue rather than say anything.

One of the "triggers" as I might call them was somebody saying how they weren't interested in winning the Olympics; the important thing was that we had beaten France. I know it was only said in jest, but still - what an incredibly stupid view of the world. France is an amazing country, and the people are fantastic too - if only most jingoistic british and french people would pull their heads out of their arses (and yes, that includes President Chirac), they would realise how great each other's cultures are. Making jokes based on conflicts that happened several hundred years ago is far too easy a "get out".

The other ridiculous comment I overheard while walking down the stairs in our building today was somebody stating to anybody who would listen in his office that all Islamic religions work by imposing their own beliefs on people in order to remove opposing religious views. I just had to walk away. It might not surprise anybody to find out that this person is a devout Christian. Why on earth do "religious" people bang on about their religious views all the f*cking time? Why do they have to be so damn pious? (and before you get uppety, I'm not religious - in many ways my views are similar to Baise Pascal - that you may as well believe in some kind of god just in case - then you have nothing to lose).

Anyway - there you go. It's cold and miserable outside, and I got soaked to the skin on the way home from work. That probably explains my mood this evening.

I think I'll go and carry on reading "The Chronicles of Narnia". Aren't children's books great

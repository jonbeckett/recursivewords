Fantastic Sunday

I'm sitting at the dining table with my laptop after probably the best day for a long time.

We decided on Friday last week that if the weather was good enough we would have a barbecue on Sunday (today). We checked the weather forecast and it said it was going to rain all weekend. Having no trust in weather forecaster, when it turned out to be sunny throughout most of yesterday we decided to roll the dice and go ahead with the barbecue anyway.

So - at 10 last night I texted our friends who live around the corner, and we spent the morning tidying things up a bit (W is the most untidy person in the universe - she typically is surrounded by family history stuff, various knitting projects, numerous books, several empty tea cups and her ever-present laptop).

Our guests arrived at about half past one, and it was tipping down with rain outside - that didn't stop me though. I pulled the big umbrella across the deck at the back of the house (putting it immediately outside the back door), and wheeled the barbecue under it too. Luckily the wind carried the smoke away from the house.

Mid way through the afternoon more guests started arriving from another barbecue that had apparently been called off - obviously they weren't as bloody minded as me 

We all had a fantastic time - we all ate too much, and we all drank a bit too much too.

I now have the prospect of a day off tomorrow and absolutely no plans to do anything (yet). Fantastic.

Ooh - on another note, I put a 3d card in my home PC yesterday (primarily so I can play Chess on it), and the flat screen then died. Typical. I now have to take the flat screen in to see if anything can be done for it; if not it's going to be time to start looking at 17C/3 flat screens... Luckily I had an old monitor that works fine - it's a bit of a shock though - going back to a monitor after a flat screen - the blurriness does your eyes in.

Here's a question for anybody who happens to read this. When a book is published internationally, do they change the spellings used to suit it's target market (the obvious example I'm thinking of here is the USA versus the UK).

There are obvious differences between "English" and "American English"words like colour/color, anything with "ise" on the end becomes "ize", and so on.

It's got me thinking. If anybody has a book by C.

S.

Lewis, Tolkein, or a Harry Potter book at home, reply to this post with which country you are in, and which spelling confirms it's specifity to a region

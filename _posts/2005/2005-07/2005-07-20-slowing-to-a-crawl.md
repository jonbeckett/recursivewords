The World Crawls

I should have realised when I woke from a deep sleep at 7:30 this morning that today the world was going to slow to a crawl.

It all started last night. I was sat in bed reading The Chronicles of Narnia, listening to my Muvo, and (apparently) I fell asleep with the book in my hands. I woke with a start as W was trying to remove the earphones. Isn't it weird how you think you have just dropped off to sleep, and then you're informed that you were out for ten or fifteen minutes.

Actually - going off on an aside here - The Magicians Nephew is better than I thought it was going to be. You obviously have to make allowances because it's a childrens book, but it's fun looking for the biblical references (if you have no idea about this, the Narnia books are somewhat famous for telling the same story as the Bible).

So - I woke up this morning after a great night's sleep, and surprisingly was bouncing around the house getting ready for work.

After the usual 3 mile bike ride through Marlow (only two near misses today) I arrive, and get settled in. What followed throughout the day can only be described as some kind of celestial event where the earth got sucked into some kind of time distortion irregularity in space or something. Today took forever  to happen.

Luckily of course the day did get to an end, otherwise I would not be sat here typing this. Yay for clocks and time.

This evening I've been checking out various blogs on the internet, and becoming more and more annoyed with people. It's happening again - the amount I'm willing to tollerate people is growing allarmingly thin once more.

The blog entry that started it tonight was one about using lobotomoy to alter the minds of sex attackers in american prisons. After I managed to stop shaking my head, I wrote a big reply to the blog about the use of lobotomy, and (while being shocked that nobody else had made a similar comment) struggled to give any kind of analogy to the idiocy of the lobotomy procedure. I equated it to something like "If I kick the door panel on my car on a tuesday when it's raining, sometimes on a friday it doesn't start if I forgot to feed the cat the night before".

Oh - while I'm being pissed off, what is it with Christian groups around the world casting doubt on children reading the Harry Potter books once again? This annoys me on two counts. 1. parents should be ecstatic that their children are wanting to read books, and 2. surely the only way to ensure a wide knowledge and sound education on which somebody can build in later life is to present them with as much raw material as possible. The point is that you can't make your own judgement on things unless you have prior knowledge on which to make that judgement - and the more knowledge you have, the better your judgement.

I guess I should stop now before people start writing to complain that I'm always moaning about religious people, or that I'll burn in Hell or something. How can you be somewhere that doesn't exist anyway?

After dragging myself out of bed this morning I was blundering around the kitchen in my half awake state and managed to kick an empty wine bottle across the floor (destroying it in the process). I stood there in my dressing gown and shouted "FOR F*CK'S SAKE!".

I'm getting a bit worried. More often than not I seem to be taking a pessimistic view of the world, and find that my level of tolerance of most things is becoming thinner by the day. Add to that the fact that I seem to be becoming less interested in everything, and worse at everything, and you start to see why I'm losing my temper.

Most lunchtimes I play chess with a couple of the guys at work. Until recently I had an unbeaten record - but over the last few days I have lost consecutively. It isn't that I've just been beaten - I have been outplayed.

My brain is just not working correctly at the moment. I'm tired a lot of the time too. What on earth is up with me?

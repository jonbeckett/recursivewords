I just did the BBC "How Old Do You Think You Are?" test, and am quietly pleased with myself.

They have compiled a load of questions about your lifestyle in order to find out how old your body probably is in relation to your real age (i.e. it finds out if you are living a crap lifestyle or not)

I was amazed to find out that my body age is 30.8, whereas my real age is 32.4, so my body is in surprisingly good condition.

If I think about it though, it kind of makes sense - I don't drink very regularly, I don't smoke, I eat tons of fruit and vegetables (mainly because W in a vegetarian), and I do things like mowing the lawn every week, and cycle 6 miles every weekday. Amazingly following their questions, we seem to live a trouble free life too - we don't argue (never have), and we have loads of friends.

If you're interested in taking the test to see how well you are getting on, the URL is below;

The test will only mean anything if you are completely truthful in your answers - and it gives loads of advice at the end about your answers, and how you're either doing the right thing, or what you could do to improve.

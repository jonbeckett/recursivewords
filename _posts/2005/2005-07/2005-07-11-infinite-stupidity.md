Somebody emailed me this news story this morning because they couldn't believe it, and I can't believe it either...

Fox News, and more idiocy.

I guess the two news stories above show just how insular and stupid America can be at times. When is America going to wake up to the fact that it is the biggest polluter in the world, and the much more important fact that more people die in Africa each month than have died in Afghanistan and Iraq put together?

I really am lost for words.

I wonder how long it will be until the world also starts to take notice of the United States own problems (massive poverty in the south, widespread racism, crime in the cities), and asks why the US isn't trying to solve it's own problems rather than trying to find excuses to bomb the crap out of any country where men grow black beards?

Before anybody retaliates, the huge majority of Americans I know are great people - hard working, knowedgeable, helpful, balanced. They happen to be people working in technical jobs though - who use the internet and are therefore aware of the wider world. The big problem is one that John McEnroe was talking about during the Live8 concert in Hyde Park this year; 70% of Americans don't own a passport, and of that 70%, 90% have never left the state they were born in.

That stupid Fox News article though... I really can't believe it.

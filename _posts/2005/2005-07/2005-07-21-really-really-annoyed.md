Okay - I am officially, really, really annoyed now. I know my blog is usually full of me moaning about things, but when events like this happen, you'll start to realise why.

I got a letter last week from HM Customs and Revenue (the UK version of the IRS) claiming that I owe them money. When you bear in mind that I have been working full time for the last 4 years, and that in the UK our employers pay our tax, you can see why I laughed.

So - I have been planning to write to them this week and let them know their mistake.

I got a phone call at work earlier from their debt recovery people, and told her about their mistake - and that I was writing to them with the details. She was fine about it.

I then got home this evening and discovered they had visited our house today to either get the money or claim goods to the value. Can you believe that?

It only occurred to me later that THEY PHONED ME AT WORKhow stupid is that?

My instinct is to write a letter and go the "right" route with this, but I am inclined to pay what they claim (in order to stop the bailiffs) and then claim it back.

It's bloody annoying though.

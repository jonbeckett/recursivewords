Today finds me sat at my desk at work somewhat pleased that I am not out in the rain.

I had originally planned to go into town this lunchtime to meet up with a guy who wants some web development done. Remembering that I ride a mountain bike to work each day, I was somewhat dismayed to get up this morning and see that rain was forecast all day - meaning in turn that I would have to ride back into town and get changed into dry clothes at the pub.

For some reason (in between the hail of work landing on my desk) I checked my gmail account this morning, and discovered that the guy I was meeting at the pub couldn't make it. Looking out of the window now, I can't say I'm too dissappointed.

So - what do I have to fill the couple of hours that I would have spent in the pub? I could tidy my desk up I suppose - it is a shocking mess at the moment... piles of books, empty museli bar boxes, bits of paper, CDs, various toys... I really should have a clear up. If I could be bothered...

Where is the sandwich man? I'm hungry now. It's half past twelve. Grumble.

Actually, the rain falling outside will do the pond at home good - it's been getting fairly low recently. It'll probably give the apples left in the tree a wash too.

Ho hum.

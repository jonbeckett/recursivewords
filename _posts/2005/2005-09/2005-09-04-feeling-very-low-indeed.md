I'm feeling about the worst I have ever, after a client called me at home (on Sunday) today and started giving me a load of hassle about a work project. I'm just a developer - I'm not the manager for the project... I finally decided enough is enough. Before going out to visit family this afternoon I updated my CV, and sent it off to several agencies.

I've had enough. I've spent most of the weekend either working, or not sleeping properly because I'm worrying about work.

It's not a good way to be, is it.

At the moment I really feel like walking away from it all immediately, but I'm sensible enough to sort out somewhere to go before resigning.

First thing tomorrow will be a visit to speak to the HR manager and let her know about the sleep problems, and the project/client problems. I'm not sure if I'll tell her yet that I'm thinking of leaving.

It doesn't help that I've ended up working on projects that I have absolutely no interest in. I want to be doing web development. Web design. Webmastering. Thin client development. I want to be using things like PHP, MySQL and Apache as my day job rather than as outside interests.

Sorry for such a downcast post to my blog. I'll probably cheer up a bit later in the week once all the dust has started to settle.

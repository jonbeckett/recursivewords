It's the weekend at last - except it isn't really for me, because I have to go back into work this afternoon to try and save a project that's gone wrong.

I've been writing this "utility" for a client for several weeks, and have hit one problem after another with it. Late yesterday we discovered that there were two major flaws in it - one of which is serious, and had completely slipped through testing.

It basically means that myself and another developer are going back into the office this afternoon to see what we can do. At about 6pm yesterday I think I solved one of the problems with the software, but the other problem is more serious. At this point I have no idea how we are going to solve it - but the other guy seems to think it will be straightforward, so I'm banking on him.

I guess I'll write more this evening when I get back.

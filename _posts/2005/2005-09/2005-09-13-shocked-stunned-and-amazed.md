A friend of mine asked me how many times my CMS script had been downloaded, and I had to tell her that I didn't know.

After a bit of thought, she helped me figure out the command to interrogate the web log file from the web server to count the number of requests for the zip file... (cat logfile|grep filename|wc -l).

Anyway - I was rather shocked.

In the last two months, CMS has been downloaded over 300 times, the old version of the Blog script has been downloaded nearly 300 times, and the new version of the blog script (unfinished as yet) has been downloaded 200 times... can you believe it! That's in two months...

The real shocker for me is that CMS is a more popular download than the blog script.

I would have imagined that the Blog script would be far more popular.

If you're also wondering what on earth I'm on about, in my spare time I work on a few open source solutions for people to put on their webspace - one of them is a "content management system" - basically a website for making websites, and the other is a "blog script" - i.e. a system for writing a journal on a website. The pluggedout website has all kinds of information and forums about them.

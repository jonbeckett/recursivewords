It's finally the weekend, and I feel better than I have in days.

Last night we visited a friend that we haven't seen in ages, and had a really great time - pizza, wine and music were the rule for the night.

Today we are having a barbecue with some other friends - this morning was spent in town buying food 

I'll write more later. Have to get on. People to visit. Fun to be had.

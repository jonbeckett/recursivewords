A couple of weeks ago I contracted a friend of mine in the states to make a necklace for W as a present for our anniversary this year. The necklace is a "one of a kind" design, hand made to my design brief which basically said "autumn colours".

I'm happy to say that this morning (with one day to go) the necklace has arrived - so I can let the cat out of the bag now.

The necklace was made by Carli Schultz-Kruze, of Juice Glass. In the daytime she works as a web designer, and in her spare time she creates amazing works of art out of glass.

Her normal blog at House of the Moon journals her attempts at making new things and is always great to have a read of.

I can't thank Carli enough for pulling all the stops out and getting the necklace to me in time for our anniversary

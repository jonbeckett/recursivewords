I'm getting closer and closer to burning out at work. I worked late on Friday night, went back in and worked from 2pm to 6pm on Sunday, did a course all day yesterday and then worked late until 9pm, and then was on a course all day today, followed by working late until 9pm again.

I've had enough.

If anybody has two minutes, please comment on this and let me know that there is a real world still out there...

On the way home from work tonight I went and bought loads of ready meal type stuff. Normally at home we cook most things ourselves, but the last week or so we have had no choice but to get quick meals because we've both been home late so much.

The worst thing is that I'm not keeping on top of my blog!

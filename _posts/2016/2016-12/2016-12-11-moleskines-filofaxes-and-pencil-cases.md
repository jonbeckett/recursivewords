While wandering around the stationers in town with our eldest daughter this morning, helping her choose Christmas presents for relatives, I spotted the rack of re-fills for Filofax personal organisers, and remembered that the diary would be running out on mine in the coming days.

Whenever I carry my Filofax into a meeting, it raises eyebrows around the room - what on earth is this software developer doing with such an old-school, eccentric method of taking notes? To be honest, I don't really have an answer - it's just something I've always done.

Let's not tell them if they looked in my bag, they would also find a Moleskine notebook filled with introspective navel gazing, and a pencil case full of drawing pens, protractors, and a scientific calculator then.

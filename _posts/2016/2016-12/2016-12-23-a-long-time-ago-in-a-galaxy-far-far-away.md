For the past several years my other half has organised a "Christmas Surprise" for the entire family - a day out somewhere once we all finish school and work, to mark the beginning of the Christmas holidays.

Today was that day, and we really had no clue what was in store until we approached the entrance to the O2 arena in London (a colossal dome structure built for the millennium celebrations, and since turned into a concert and exhibition venue).

I spotted the colossal Star Wars posters first and started grinning. An exhibition of Star Wars memorabilia, and interactive activities for children to investigate the light and dark side of "The Force" - touching on psychology, sociology, parenting, character, nature, nurture... but wrapped up cleverly in such a way that children could understand it all.

In-between the interactive exhibits, the entire place was crammed to the rafters with props, spaceships, and costumes - I've shared a few photos below:

I'm an unabashed Star Wars geek - but then I grew up in the 1970s and 80s - immersed in the movies, toys, and mythology. I thought the exhibition was wonderful - one of the best days out in quite some time. Each successive room brought gasps, and wide eyes as the spaceships, characters, and worlds we know so well appeared around each corner. Standing in front of the block of carbonite that Han Solo was frozen in felt very strange indeed.

If you live in or near London, I can't recommend it enough.

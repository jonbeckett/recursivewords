Tonight marked a milestone of sorts for the project I have been working on for the last several weeks. I finally pulled the curtains back, and started letting users in to wreck everything try everything out. To say I'm burned out would be something of an understatement.

I'm just looking forward to going home now.

This has been an "agile" project - with a colossal "sprint" from the first meeting three weeks ago, through to today. The system isn't finished - work will continue in the weeks and months ahead, but the whole "lifting the world on your shoulders" bit has now been done, and I've somehow managed to put it back down in one piece.

I had grand plans to read books while away this week, but I've been so tired during the evenings that I've fallen asleep by eight or nine o'clock. I can't ever remember doing that before.

I leave at lunchtime tomorrow. Home to my family. Home for Christmas and New Year.

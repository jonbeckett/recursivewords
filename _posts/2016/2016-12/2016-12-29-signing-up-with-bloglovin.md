I have no idea if BlogLovin is still a thing, or if it is any better or worse than any of the other aggregators such as Feedly, but what the hell.

If you click the link below, apparently you can follow me via their blogging service as well as via WordPress.

Follow my blog with Bloglovin [https://www.bloglovin.com/blog/18402821/?claim=cp9c5bc2g76]

I will of course reciprocate.

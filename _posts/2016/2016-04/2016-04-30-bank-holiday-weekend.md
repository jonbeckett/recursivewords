The house seems strangely quiet this morning. Our younger daughterswho would normally be into the second hour of a Mario Kart marathon by noware not here. They are camping in a field about an hour away with the Girl Guides for the weekendthe preparations for which were evidenced by our kitchen looking like the headquarters of an Everest expedition for much of the week.

You would think, with the younger children being absent from the house that I might have taken the opportunity for a lie-in. I would have thought so tooonly my stupid brain had other ideas. I woke at 6:30am, and stared at the ceiling for a while before drifting back off to sleep. I woke again at 7:30am, and resumed the daydreaming for what seemed like ages. I looked across at the alarm clock7:45am. I got up.

It's now heading towards 10am, and I'm still the only person up. I had a shower, shave, got dressed, and tidied the house up over an hour ago. For the last hour I've been sitting in the study, tinkering with the old iMac (I'm writing this on it). The soundtrack to the movie "Hackers" is playing in iTunesI copied a selection of MP3s over to it after upgrading the hard drive last week.

Time to make another coffee I guess. Maybe some toast too.

Did I write anything in the blog about my bike being broken? The chainset broke rather spectacularly at the start of the week, and given it's age, it's general state, and the battering I give it on a weekly basis (I cycle to work, rain or shine), it makes little sense to get it serviced and repaired this timeit's time for a new bike, and for the old one to be sold for spares (or salvaged and turned into a second hand bike for somebody else).

No bike has meant walking to work this week. The office is about 3 miles from home, so the walk takes about 45 minutes or so. Although I was out of the office for a couple of days this week, on the days I found myself walking, I tried out listening to audio books. I've had an account at Audible for years, and had bought a couple of books for the kids a couple of years agobut had never listened to any of it myself. I discovered that books are much preferrable to listening to tech podcasts advertising all manner of junk with in-programme advertising every twenty minutes. The various TWiT podcasts are the worst offenderstalking about the tech news of the week one minute, and then trying to sell you a new matress for your bed the next. It drives you nuts.

Anyway!I guess I should get on with something this morning. Maybe a walk into town to look at the bikes. I'm thinking I should really take my other half with me thoughto stop me spending stupid money on a fixed-gear hybrid custom built monster.

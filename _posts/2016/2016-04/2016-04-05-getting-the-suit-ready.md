Mid-morning tomorrow I board thetrain once more, headed towards central London to visit a prospective client of the company I work for. Instructions are for a suit, shirt, and tie to be worn, so I will be complying. It's months since I last wore a full suit to a meeting.

It's kind of a relief. While sitting in the office for days on end, other than pontificating about the stationary on my desk, I end up with nothing to sharenothing to write about. At least sitting on trains, and in cafes waiting for meetings I get to watch the world go by and record my thoughts to later share with the world.

It looks like I may be heading to Scotland in the coming months too. And the north of England later this month. I'll finally have stories to share.

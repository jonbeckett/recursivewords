After a couple of hours reading reviews, and weighing up the various pros and cons, I put an order in for a new bike this morninga "Charge Plug 0". It's a single speed hybrid road bikelike nothing I have ever owned before.

It will start it's life with no mudguards, and no lightsand of course it has no gears, and no suspension. Later in the year I will add lights, but for the moment I'm just going to live with it "as is". I'm looking forward to itit's rare that I get a new bikethe last one was acquired after the previous one was stolenabout six years ago.

It's going to be a huge change after riding mountain bikes for the last twenty years

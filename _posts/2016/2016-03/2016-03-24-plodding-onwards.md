It's Thursday morning before the bank holiday weekend. I have a conference call in a little while hence the appearance of the headset on my desk. Work has been kind of interesting over the last week or sowe're "crossing the streams", Ghostbusters styleI've been doing some coding on the back end of WordPress. I can't tell youwhat I've been doing, but stillit's far more interesting than the usual stuff I get to work on.

After today we have four days off for Easter. Four days to kick back and relax (yeah rightlike that's going to happen), before returning to the mayhem. And Aprilis going to be mayhemoff around the country to deliver demos, and to work at far flung client offices. It's funnymany people see travelling with work as some kind of glamorous existence, but those of us that have done it know the truthit's not fun, it's not glamorous, and it's often lonely.

While travelling with work, all I might typically see is the inside of trains, the inside of taxis, the inside of the client's offices, and the insides of the hotel I'm staying in. If there is a supermarket nearby, I will also get to know that supermarket pretty wellopting to buy food there rather than sit in a pub or restaurant on my own. The hotel room will usually have a television, that I will rarely switch onopting instead to surf the internet, read books on the Kindle, or listen to podcasts.

That's all a few weeks away yet though. In the meantime the children have two weeks off school for Easter. Two entire weeks. Madness. I joked last night that they would spend all day, every day, either playing football outside the house, or bouncing on the trampoline in the back garden. I bet I'm not far from the truth.

For months I have been a blogging automaton of sortsposting something or other each dayrain or shine. And yet, over the last week I have missed day after day. The blog has become the last thing on my mind. No doubt I will write about the reasons one day (and there are very good reasons for my distraction), but for nowlet's just pretend that it's nice to take a break.

There was a time of course when people thought it insane to try and write every daywhich gave rise to "madcap" challenges such as "National Blog Posting Month". Of course these days most people engaged in the social internet post many times a day to many platforms. Some seem more afflicted than others with the compulsion to share every facet of their life, and to react to every vibration of our phone like a gun-slinger on a hair trigger.

When the quiet days happen (which are many for me), I churn out some of the most mundane blog posts imaginableand can almost hear a distant friend whispering in my year"you're blogging about blogging again".

There's a rather famous quote by Plato that probably applies:Wise men speak because they have something to sayfools because they have to say something.

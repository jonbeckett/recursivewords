I began writing this post at 5:45am on Sunday morning. I got up early to watch the first Formula One grand prix of the year from Melbourne, Australia. While standing in the kitchen a few moments ago, making a second cup of tea (the race was red flagged after Fernando Alonso lunched his car quite spectacularly), I looked at the clock and thought "actually, I've had 6 hours sleep - I could get up this early more often, and get a few hours of the day to myself before everybody else wakes up". Not a bad plan at all.

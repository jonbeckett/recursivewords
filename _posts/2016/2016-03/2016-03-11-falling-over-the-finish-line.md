This week has beena slog, for all sorts of reasons that I'm not about to write in a public blog post. I wish I could, but it wouldn't solve anything. Let's just say bringing up children is hardand bringing up adopted children can beinfinitely more difficult.

I promised the children Domino's pizza for dinner this evening. Notice how I promised them something I would like? Crafty.

Do you ever have weeks where you reach the weekend and think "well next week can only get better" ? Of course there's an air of inevitability now that next week will make this week look like a walk in the park, but you never know. Yes, I'm a blind optimist/idiot (delete as appropriate).

If you'll excuse me, I have some important pizza ordering decisions to make.

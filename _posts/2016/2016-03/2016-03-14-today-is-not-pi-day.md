I've been avoiding "Pi Day" posts on the internet all day, and while avoiding them, an anger has been bubbling up slowly and steadily. It's no good. I'm going to have to post this, before I suddenly lash out at somebody in the comedic way angry English people tend to when pushed just a little too far.

Here's the thing. There are only three countries in the world that format their dates appropriately for the numerology idiots to claim that today is "Pi Day". Those countries are the United States of America, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Belize.

The entire rest of the world formats their written dates differently, so are looking at the various posts doing the rounds on the social internet platforms, and either getting more and more fed up (like me), or trying to figure out if they should say something about this being the "World Series" all over again.

Even the idea of "Pi Day" is stupid. Just to show how stupid, let's list a few dates that everybody missed: February 1971 should have been Euler's Month 21st May 1977 should have been Euler's Constant Day 4th June 1969 should have been Mitchell Feigenbaum Day June 1966 should have been the month of theBeast 1st June 2018 should beGolden Section DayI could go on

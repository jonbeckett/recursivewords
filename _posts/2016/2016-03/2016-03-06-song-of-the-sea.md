We watched the animated movie "Song of the Sea" this evening with the children. I had desperately wanted to see it at the cinema after seeing the trailers at the cinema a couple of years agobut as is normal around here, life happened, and any thoughts about the movie were swept away.

It's a gorgeous moviethe animation is wonderful, and the soundtrack is stunning. I think perhaps the most interesting thing about it for me is the similarity between the Irish folk-story at it's heart, The Little Mermaid, and Ponyo. As the story unfolded, I found myself smiling again and again.

And yes, without ruining it too much, I had a few tears towards the end. You'll know why if you've seen it.

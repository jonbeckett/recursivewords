Here we are again. I ate my lunch at half past twelve, but carried on workingit's now 3:30pm. I have a conference call in an hourand am sorely tempted to down-tools until the call. I keep doing thiseating over the keyboard, and just carrying on. I guess busy is good though, because it makes the day go by more quickly.

I brought the old iPad into the office with me to play withjust got it out of the bag, connected it to the guest WiFi in the office, and it wants to do an operating system update immediately. Fun. I'm guessing this is Apple moving the line in the sand ever so slowly forwardsadding hardware to new iPads, and rendering older iPads obsolete. It already runs dog slow, but I can't complainI think we bought it about 5 years ago. I have a Google Nexus tablet kicking around at home that became a paperweight about 18 months after launch.

Here's the thingboth myself and my other half have the cheapest Amazon Fire tablets at home. Sure, they only run stuff from the Amazon app store, but they also last for ages on a charge, and they are faster than the iPads that cost three or four times as much. Apple can go suck itI'm never going to buy any of their hardware againespecially after Phil Schiller looked down on owners of older computers as second class citizens while on-stage at the Apple keynote last week. Elitist dick.

I'm just wondering about sneaking off to the kitchen to make another coffee before this telephone conference starts. There is some flapjack in the fridge from last week that everybody else forgot about. I might have to make it disappear.

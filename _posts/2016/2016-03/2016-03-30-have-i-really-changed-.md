I received a nice message from somebody thismorning somebody who used to be "somebody" on Tumblr. As far as I was concerned,she was one of the "Tumblr A-List"placed on a pedestal in the version of the internet that exists in my head. She was wonderfulto everybody, shared carefully curated moments from her life, and set an example I still chase today in terms of "how to be" on the internet. And then she vanished. Gone. One day she just upped sticks and walked away from the social internet.

We have quietlykeptin touchover the years (and yes, it really is years now since she left)via quiet emails back and forth a very few words every so manymonths. Whichexplains the email I received this morning.

She said I hadn't changed a bitin thehowever many years since we first crossed paths. It must be seven or eight now.

I'm not so sure. I look, and see somebody a little older, a little heavier, a little more weary, a little more cynical, and a lot more tired than the guy that crossed paths with her all those years ago. I wonder what I've done with my life over those yearswhere I've come fromwhere I'm goingand it's hard to organise the jumble at all.

I'm just me. Plodding on. Putting one foot in front of the otherlike I always have. So maybe she was rightI haven't changed so much at all. I'm still the same personstill putting one foot in front of the othera constant in the blogging universe. Quietly going about this strange business of recording thoughts and memories, and crossing paths with all sorts of people, from all sorts of backgrounds, from all corners of the world.

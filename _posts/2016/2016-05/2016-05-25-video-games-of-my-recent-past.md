It's rare that I play video games these days, despite the fact that I've been buying up the XBox 360 games from the bargain bins for months. I thought it might be fun to go through the various games I've had a chance to play.

Destiny

Just installed this onto the XBox a few weeks ago, and have had the chance to play it a grand total of two times so far. It appears to be a very elaborate embellishment of any other first person shooter - with a variety of weapon upgrades, and random internet people running around interfering.

Half Life 2

Played the first hour of this while showing our eldest daughter the game about a month ago. Yet another first person shooter dressed up as something more elaborate, but when it comes down to it, the open looking world isn't at all, and shooting guards becomes really quite boring very quickly indeed.

Grand Theft Auto 5

Still haven't played this far enough to unlock the crazy character (can't even remember his name). Wandering around the city is fun, and the radio stations are funny for a while too. I just don't have the time to invest in playing it much.

Formula One 2014

I just bought this a couple of months ago. I used to play the older versions a LOT, and immediately qualified on pole in a crappy car, which kind of took the shine off it a bit. I wanted to have to fight for points in shitty cars to make the game fun. It still is fun though (sort of).

Mass Effect

I have all the Mass Effect games, and played the first few hours of the first one about a year ago - I've forgotten the entire story though, so probably need to go back and do it again. I like it better than Half Life 2 from what I remember of it.

Skyrim

I've played it for a few hours, and done the first few quests, but just don't have the time to invest in it properly. I bought the guide book about a year ago with intentions of having a proper crack at it, but still haven't made time yet.

TitanFall

Bought this last week because it was on offer (I guess Amazon is clearing the back catalogue out of their stock rooms). I still haven't even unwrapped it, but it looks like yet another first person shooter. Let's hope it's a bit more fun than some of the others?

Halo 3,4,5 etc

I can't even keep track of Halo any more. I remember playing the first couple of Halo games on the XBox, and liking them a lot. I'm not sure why, but I've just not got into the newer ones - I think I have "Reach" too, and played it for a few hours a year or so back. It's good fun, because it doesn't try to be more than a shooter on rails.

Gears of War

I've got all the Gears of War games - bought from the bargain bucket at the local second hand store. I have never played any of them, although I understand everybody says they are good. I can't help feeling they are just going to be shooters on rails though.

Medal of Honour

More shooters on rails. I have several of the Medal of Honour and Modern Warfare games - all bought from the bargain bucket. I guess I should really invest some time in them before completely disregarding them.

This week has seemed to be all about getting on the treadmill, and running as fast as you can to get nowhere. I've been head down writing Javascript and Powershell at work, and running here, there and everywhere in the evenings too. Tonight I didn't sit down until nearly 10pm.

Apparently I can't type tonight. Of course I'm going to blame the hardware in front of me, but it might also have something to do with a bottle of cider, and half a bottle of wine. I'm in the magical "Nanatache" mode. If you've never seen "Down and Out in Beverley Hills", let me translate - "Nanatache" means "Man who lost his American Express card, and don't give a fuck". Except of COURSE that's rubbish. Google Translate doesn't say that, and we all know computers are always right, right ?

While cycling home from work over the last few days, I've come to the conclusion that I need to buy a helmet camera - the captured video would make me famous. I don't think the scenes involving cars would necessarily cause high viewing figures - more the moments when I get cut up in the middle of town, and shout "YOU COMPLETE COCK" at people. Actually, I mumble the reactions, but in the Billy Liar universe of my mind, I would love to stop in the street and call out some car driver for their idiotic behaviour.

Can I just say - I was passed by a numpty on a bike in town yesterday. After passing me, he mounted the path to avoid traffic. I secretly wanted him to get caught by the police. Tonight I saw another person cycling on the path, and thought "why can't the police throw the book at these idiots"... the guy tonight was probably worse - no helmet, no reflective clothing, and there he was, cycling at perhaps 20mph down the footpath alongside the road.

Something else happened tonight that also caused a reaction in my head - some guys riding scooters drove past as I walked our youngest home from her dance class. They were pulling wheelies. I wanted them to fall off, to make an example of them to others. I knew while thinking that the thoughts were dark, and horrible, but for those moments when they broke so many laws, I wanted them to get what was coming to them.

Maybe it's just better if I go to bed tonight.

p.s. thanks Space-X for making me wait all day for your launch, and then delaying by 90 minutes. Guess I won't be watching it after all now.

The alarm went off at 6:30am this morning, and we scraped ourselves out of bed. I jumped in the shower and had a shave, re-appearing in time to discover the younger children arguing about breakfast.

Today was a big day. Our youngest would be making the transition from junior school to "big school" - a sports academy that specializes in teaching children with development delays. Her taxi arrived at about 7:45am (transport is provided), and we all trooped out of the house to wave her off. She looked oddly grown up in her new blazer, skirt, and shoes.

A few minutes later Miss 12 shouted goodbye - charged with escorting the daughter of a friend into school for the first time. She's a funny old thing - if left to her own devices she flounders - but if given a task, she flourishes. She was ready to leave the house half an hour before she needed to.

While getting my own things ready for work, I bent down to pick up my work bag, and something very strange happened. It felt like the world began to tip over. You know when you've had a few too many to drink, and the room begins to spin when you go to bed? That happened - only I was stone cold sober. I know it's an inner ear problem, and I've had it before - so sat up, and waited for it to abate. Here's the curious thing - it didn't get better as it usually does. I wandered into the kitchen, leaning on the wall as I went, and told my other half.

"There's no way you're going to work like that"

"I might be alright in a few minutes"

While continuing to get ready for work I realised it was raining outside, and that I would need waterproof trousers. Do you think I could find them? Of course not. In the end I figured it would make just as much sense to wear swimming shorts on the mountain bike, so ran off upstairs to find them. I wish I had thought of wearing them before - they are much more comfortable than the leggings I usually wear in wet weather.

My balance did improve, and I made it into work a little before 9. Throughout the morning a huge wave of tiredness hit me though, and the world started to tip over again. I stuck it for an hour before talking to HR, and making my way home. They were pretty concerned about me making my own way home - particularly on a bike - and offered to drive me. I was allowed to go on my own on condition that I called back after reaching home.

A couple of hours later all traces of the balance problem appear to have gone. I'm still incredibly tired though, and am wondering if the two are connected somehow.

This evening was a bit mad. Imagine everybody trying to talk at once to tell the story of their day over dinner. Then add to that a dinner table filled with tacos, and various fillings (a master-stroke to make dinner from leftovers). Then finally add an hour washing up with our eldest, before sorting the biggest sock mountain ever seen by the human eye.

It's only just gone 8pm and I'm already thinking about turning in for the night. Maybe the tiredness thing is a virus? Maybe I'm just turning into an old fart...

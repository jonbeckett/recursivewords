A few days ago I was tagged on Tumblr to take part in a "My Aesthetic" meme. The task seemed to require the compilation of ten photos you had taken in the past that you feel describe you as a person. I enjoyed pulling the photos together (mostly from Instagram [https://instagram.com/jonbeckett]), and thought it might be fun to include them here too.

Enjoy!

When I arrived at a client site with work recently, the woman that greeted me in reception shook my hand, and then the following conversation happened :

"We lookup up your photo on the internet, and can't believe you've been working there for 15 years - you don't look old enough!"

"Umm... I'll take that as a compliment?"

... cue awkward moment as I grimace, and my co-worker tries not to burst out laughing.

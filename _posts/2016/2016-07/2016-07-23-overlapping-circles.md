I've started writing this post three times so far. I was going to write about a television show, and the parallels with my own lifebut then wondered if it was all a bit metaa bit niche. This is ridiculous of coursebecause filtering the subjects I might write about implies the expectations of an audienceand I can probably count the regular readers of my inane thoughts on the fingers of one hand.

Today has been interesting. From the cycle to work through insane traffic, to the morning conference call where somebody accidentally said more than they should, to the awkwardly hilarious conversation that took place in the office this afternoon (that I obviously can't share), to the eating dinner while stood in the kitchen, to washing up before racing to soccer practice with Miss 10, and then wandering back through the inky dark night to empty my head into the keyboard. The day has just not stopped.

The accidental betrayal of confidences on the phone earlier was funny. I'm going to be very careful in describing the situation, so I don't land myself in trouble. Get ready for an award winning example of vague writing.

You know the situation where you mention something to somebody, and they presume you know far more than you have intimated (you are not aware you have intimated anything), and they precede to hint at all sorts of things without saying anything specific. Oh. My. God.

Anyway. The information is securely locked away in my big toe (that's where my brain is), and I've used SHA-1 encryption on it (nerds will get that joke).

Change of subject.

While writing this, our youngest daughter is at football practice again. She's somehow found herself playing for two football teams at onceboth the boys/town team, and the girls team. The results of her crazy schedule of activities showed itself tonighthaving left a dance class an hour before football, she raced home, got changed, and then walked to the floodlit pitches with me, where they had just started warming up. She joined everybody to run two laps around the pitches. In a field of perhaps 50 girls, aged from her age to perhaps 15, guess who flew past everybody to the front, and easily held pace with the leaders?The shock wasn't her speedshe's always been fastthe shock was how easily she did it. She could have run laps all night. At one point she sprinted off to kick a nearby football, before re-joining the leaders. At the end of two laps, the train of girls stretched out over perhaps 100 yardsI'm guessing they are the kids that usually sit in front of the TV.

You'll have to excuse me enthusing over such a simple thing, but this little girl was the one who came to us at 2 years old from a foster carer after suffering terrible neglect, and could hardly walk. She had spent her first year or so in a stroller almost continually, so has always suffered with both major and minor motor control issues. When she was tiny we made her walk everywhere. Now she is bigger,she runs everywhere. She's fast, slightly built,and efficient over the groundrunning has become something she is goodat. In a world where she will always struggle academically, she has something she is good at, and we are going to hang on to that with white knuckles.

While checking the news at lunchtime I happened to glance at Twitter as the news broke that the actor Alan Rickman had died. No doubt the massed ranks of the internet are churning as we speaksummoning their armies to deluge social media with a wave of invented griefdesigned to attract attention. They did it a few days ago for David Bowie, and they did it last year for Robin Williamswe can pretty confidently assume they will do it again.

Some people like to wallow, and some see wallowing as an opportunity to gain attention. I hatethat. Is it not far better to remember somebody as they once were, and to share those cherished memories with future generations?I'm sure Alan Rickman would love to cast Snape's shadow over future generations of wide eyed childrenjust as our children laughed uproariously at Robin Williams antics as Mork from Ork.

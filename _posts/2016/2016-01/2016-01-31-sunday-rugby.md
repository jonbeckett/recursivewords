Today I will be mostly sitting in a car with a stranger, to get a lift to a far-flung rugby match that our middle daughter is playing in. Three quarters of an hour each way to stand in the rain, watching two teams scraped together across two counties from girls that used to play with boys teams, but are not allowed to any more.

She's on the verge of quitting rugby, because the only training she can find is on a Sunday morning with the women's team of the next town. The town we live in has a huge rugby club, with squads of 50 or more boys at each ageand no girls teams. There is a women's team, but nothing else.

It's pretty ridiculous, given that England are the World Champions in women's rugby.

Anywaytime for me to go find my walking boots, waterproofs, and fill a bag with snacks.

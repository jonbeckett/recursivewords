We spent yesterday evening counting down the final hours of 2015 in the company of good friendseating, drinking, and playing ridiculous games (have you heard of "Chicken Charades"?). I tend to do what I'm told in terms of plans and arrangementsbut caught wind half-way through the evening that we had actually been invited to two different friends houses. We ended up at the friend that asked first -I hate letting anybody down.

Unfortunately Miss 15 decided that washing her hair was an insurmountable obstacle to going out yesterday evening, so she spent the entire night alone at home. I came home and checked on her during the evening, and got grunted at. I imagine we'll be communicating via monosyllabic grunts for the next couple of days until she gets over herself (again).

So. It's officially 2016. We fell into bed at about 2am (I think), and then woke at 7, then 8, then finally 9am. So far I've washed up, tidied up the lounge, washed the carpet in the study (don't ask), loaded the washing machine and tumblr dryer (which is rumbling away in the background), had a coffee, and hooked out the laptop to write this. Monsters Versus Aliens is on the television, and after a Christmas of torrential rain and unseasonably warm temperatures, it's finally freezing cold this morning. Following the downpour, Winter seems to have remembered what it's supposed to do.

I'm amazed I don't have a hangover to be honestmy glass kept magically re-filling itself with wine last night, and then somebody talked me into trying out a berry-flavoured cider. I rarely drink any more, so yeahstunned that I have no headacheno after effects at all.

Today is going to be a very, very quiet day. I need to get some bread out of the freezer. Cheese sandwiches for everybody.

Oh yesHappy New Year!

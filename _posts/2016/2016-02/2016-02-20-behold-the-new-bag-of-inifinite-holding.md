While travelling back from Cornwall on the train with the children on Thursday, our youngest daughter pointed out that my trusty backpack had not one, but five holes in various placeswhich she demonstrated by poking her finger through each hole as she counted them. She also noted that several of the zips were either broken, or starting to fall apart.

In reality I have been meaning to buy a new bag for months, but it's one of those things that you never quite get around to. The old bag was perhaps 10 years old, so I can't complain that it hasn't lasted. I placed an order for a new bag on Amazon yesterday morning, and the delivery driver arrived this morning. Not bad at all.

It's an "Amazon Basics" bagwhich almost certainly means it's manufactured by somebody else, and has the label stitched on in some faceless factory somewherein much the same way that all pre-cooked food in supermarkets is made in one place, and labelled differently for each supermarket chain.

AnywayI have a new bag! I wish it was more exciting, but it's kind of not. It's a black backpack. It has a padded laptop compartment big enough for my work laptop. It has a storage bit big enough for charger, mountain bike spares, the filofax, and any other bits and bobs. The bike lock fits in the stretchy drink holder bit at the side.

The only think I might do is attach some kind of reflective thing to the back of itit always worries me that I wear a reflective waterproof while on the commute to work, but then cover my back with a black backpack. I'm guessing some kind of reflective tape will solve that.

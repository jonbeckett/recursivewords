It's Thursday night, my other half has gone to visit friends, the children are in bed, and I just spent longer than might feasibly be imagined choosing a movie to watch in the lounge on my own. After nearly choosing the latest James Bond movie, and searching for several movies that were unavailable via any of the means we have to stream them down from the magical clouds above, I ended up going with an old friend.

You've Got Mail.

Sorry just got distracted for several minutes listening to one of the opening monologues. This movie does that to mesucks me in unexpectedly, regardless that I've seen it countless times.

I guess a huge part of the reason You've Got Mail holds such an affectionate place in my heart is because I met my other half on the internetback when it was incredibly rare to do so. For years our story made us the centre of attention at parties, with other guests gathering around, and quizzing us.

Of course You've Got Mail is also about books, and the love of reading. If only you could see the end of our lounge, and the rows and rows of bookshelves. I hate to think how much we have spent on books over the years (even though in recent years we have both owned Kindles).

Unfortunately we no longer have a book store in townif we did, I dread to think how many books we would have amassed by now. The demise of local bookstores is probablybest reserved for a post all of it's own at some point in the future when I'm feeling particularly angry about life, the universe, and everything.

Sorry again just watched the scene where ShopGirl sits in the cafe all night waiting for her e-mail friend to arrive, and is confronted with Joe Fox instead, and fires round upon round of vitriol at him.

Oh my god, this movie

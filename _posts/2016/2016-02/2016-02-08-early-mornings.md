I'm back in London this weekwhich means getting up at 6am to catch the 7am trainor, as happened this morning, getting up at 6:15am to stumble around the house comatose after sitting up until 2am watching the first half of the Superbowl.

You might think I would have learned my lesson about staying up late. You would be wrong. Throughout the journey home this evening I struggled to stay awake, and after finishing the washing up, am struggling again. It's only 8pm at the time of writing, and I'm dead on my feet.

Four more days, and then I head to the coast to visit my parents. I may well sleep for the entire time we're there.

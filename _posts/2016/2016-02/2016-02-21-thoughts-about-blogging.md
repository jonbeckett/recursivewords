While reading various posts from a number of different corners of the internet recentlyand no, I'm not going to name anybody, or anywhere, because I'm not that kind of horrible persona truism of sorts occurred to me. Some people dig their own holesand they're good at it.

What do I mean? Maybe that while some people pull the "poor me drama" that the Celestine Prophecy wrote about, the chief architect of their problems is often themselvesand they are usually the last person to see it (or admit to it). Of course not everybody that ends up in a desperate situation has caused it, or deserves it, but for some you wonder. Especially when they end up in the same situations repeatedly. I get itsome people can't catch a breakbut some some are good at digging the holes they fall into.

I'm also surprised by the duality I see in people that write blog postsand yet I shouldn't be, because I know it exists in me too. I write these public postsspouting words across the public internet for nobody in particular to readbut am somehow far more comfortable with strangers reading them than people I knowdespite the fact that I'm putting the words out there to be found.

In my head, I separate visitors into two campsthose "in the real world", and those "on the internet". It's stupid really, because the people on the internet are in the real world too. I guess the flaw in the plan arises when you realise that some of the people you might class as living in your "internet" group are also members of your "real world".

I'm far more careful than I once was about the subjects I might write about, and far more selective about the stories I might share. I have a very few friendships around the world that have spanned many yearswe tend to keep in touch via email and instant messaging rather than our public blog postsit's almost like having a trusted "back channel" of sorts. Finding those kinds of friends"confidants" for want of a better wordis incredibly difficult though, and I feel very lucky to have one or two.

You might think, given that I work as a software and web developer in the daytime, and carry a mobile phone in my pocket that's perpetuallyconnected to Google Drive, and Google Calendar, that I would have divorced paper from my life. You would be wrong.

For the last several years I have carried a "personal" Filofax around with me, it's week-to-view calendar scrawled all over with plans, meetings, travel arrangements, hotel bookings, and so on. It's been a wonderful ally while sitting in conference rooms, and on trains over the last few years, allowing me to scribble down notes quickly, ordraw silly doodles while clock watching.

I get it. It's a throw backto the mid 1980s and beyond. An eccentric echo to the past that should probably have disappeared by now. I like pen and paper though, and I like that people take an interest in it when I hook it out of my bag in meetings to write something down.

There's a catch though.I've always felt the "personal" Filofax is a little bit too small. While it's easy to carry, and easy to throw in the backback, it's actually quite difficult to write anything in, because the rings that bind the pages almost always get in your way.

So this yearfor my birthdayI made the biggerversion of the same Filofax I have been carrying around the single item atop my wish-listand this evening I totally blew the surprise that my other half had already ordered it, when I began having second thoughts about it (she nearly exploded).

I had been busy looking at Amazon, adding the various bits of stationary I might like to my wish list, and after totting up the various bits and pieces, thought "this is all getting a bit expensive"and said as much to her. She sighed, looked up, and said "why do you ALWAYS do this?!". Oops.

So now I reallyam filling the wish-list with various inserts to go into an A5 filofax. Pocket money priced items that the kids might be able to get for me in town between now and my birthday. If you start to see idiotically geeky posts about stationary items turning up in the blog over the coming days, I'm not going to apologise at all

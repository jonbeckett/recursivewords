I pulled the trigger on something this morning. Something I have been thinking about for some time. I guess you could call it "aligning the planets", but you could also call it "slipping further under the radar".

I've renamed the WordPress [https://kentthebanjocat.wordpress.com/] blog to match Tumblr [https://kentthebanjocat.tumblr.com/], LiveJournal [https://kentthebanjocat.livejournal.com/], KIK, and Snapchat. Of course I've renamed before - only this time I've also created a new user account, and transferred the blog over to that user account. You're probably rolling your eyes, and wondering why.

By going with new usernames attached to new email addresses, I cannot be found by searching for my email address within any of the walled gardens. I'm not deliberately hiding - I'm just making it very difficult for anybody to find me by chance.

That is all. Nothing else to see. Please move along.

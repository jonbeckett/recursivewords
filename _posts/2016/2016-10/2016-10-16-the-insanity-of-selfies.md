While somepeople pepper Instagram, Flickr, Facebook and Tumblr with their smiling face, I seem to have avoided the self-directed spotlight in recent years. I'm not really sure why. Maybe it's to do with narcissism, or maybe it's to do with the focal point of a photo? If you aresharing a photo of a place, the only reason I can think of to include yourself is to trumpet "look where I am" - to provide proof that you can indeed piss higher than your peers. I hate the pissing game.

I hate what much social media has become. In so many ways I've always been a bit of an introvert - always taking the alternative path, the path less travelled. If I land in the middle of a large group I will invariably gravitate towards those on the outside, rather than those in the middle. Quiet people. My people. We have much to say, but we don't necessarily want everybody to hear it.

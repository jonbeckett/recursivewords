At 2am this morning I sat in bed on my own, gazing at my mobile phone, wondering when sleep would crash into me like anunpredictable freight train. I had just spent an hour catching up with a distant friend. After putting my phone on charge, pulling the covers up, and rolling over, I heard the familiar vibration behind me. The next half hour was filled withan entirely unexpected conversation with the one person I had really missed since leaving Tumblr.

I'm afraid the result is entirely predictable.

I'm pitching a tent pole in Tumblr land once again. I very much doubt I will follow many people, and I very much doubt I will put much effort into it, but I realised last night how much I missedthe crazy bunch of introspective bloggers I left behind when I walked away.

I'm trying not to over-think it - not to decidehow I will use it, or how often I might post. In many ways it will be the "Upside Down" of my blogging existence( if you've not seen Stranger Things, that reference will be lost on you - go watch it - it's awesome). A place to visit late at night, to escape from everybody and everything that typically surrounds me.

Oh, and before anybody says anything, I damn well know that Tumblr is kind of like the rabbit hole in Alice in Wonderland, and that there's no such thing as "just visiting now and again". You start scrolling the insanity at midnight, and before you know it, the sun has come up once more. I also know this was the single most stupid thing I could have done with NaNoWriMo approaching, but then that kind of fits the form guide for "being me".

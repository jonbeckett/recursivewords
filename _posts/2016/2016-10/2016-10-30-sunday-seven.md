 * The house is ready for Halloween party tomorrow night. I have no idea why we    have invited friends to our house again.          * As the years go by, I notice more and more that it's always the usual    suspects that make things happen either at school, or among a circle of    friends.          * I uploaded the entire back-log of my blog to GitHub last night. Every post    since 2003 is now there as markdown files. I don't know why I did it - it    seemed like a good idea at the time.          * I made a new friend on the internet this past week. I very rarely make new    friends on the internet.          * I'm working in a hotel next week with work, and a co-worker will be staying    at the same hotel. That invariably means eating out together, and making    conversation. I'm kind of dreading it.          * I'm not looking forward to this week at work at all, for reasons I can't    share. I'll get over myself, and work through it - I always do.          * I still have no idea what I'm going to write about for NaNoWriMo, and it    starts tomorrow night. Fuck.

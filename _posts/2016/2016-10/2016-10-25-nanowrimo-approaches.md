There are only five days left until the annual lunacy starts, and I haven't given a single thought to what I might write about yet. I've tinkered with the old netbook to make sure it has a copy of Scrivener installed, but beyond that I've done nothing.

Should I be planning anything? Maybe I should call this the "extreme" version of NaNoWriMo - where you cross the line of midnight at the end of October with no idea what you're actually going to write, and just start writing.

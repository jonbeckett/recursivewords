I realised today that NaNoWriMo (National Novel Writing Month) starts in two weeks. I'm already wondering if I can get away with doing it purely by writing 1700 words a day in the blog for a month ? I could title the book "Nothing Worth Writing About".

I'm pretty good at writing about nothing. I'm pretty sure if the folks at CERN were to investigate my blog they would find most of the missing dark matter in the universe, and their sums would suddenly start adding up. I would be wheeled out in front of the world press, and asked to comment at length about nothing equaling something.

Being half serious for a moment, I'm half-tempted to have a go at it again. I know it's madness, but there's something tremendously eccentric, romantic and idiotic about trying to write a 50,000 word novel in 30 days. I've tried before, and always failed, butyou never know - this could be my year.

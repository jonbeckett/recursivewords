Normally I am absolutely fine with being alone - with living inside my own little bubble - but sometimes I can feel incredibly lost, and I have no idea why. Even in a room full of people, it's like I'm suddenly detached from everybody and everything around me.

Today is one of those days.

I'm over-thinking everything. Over-reacting to everything. Investing either too much or too little in everything. Nothing is making sense at the moment.

Perhaps it's tiredness. Perhaps a good night's sleep will help ?

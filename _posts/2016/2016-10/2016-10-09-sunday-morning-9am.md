The clock has just ticked past 9am on Sunday morning. I have been up for about an hour. I've had a shower, got dressed, had some breakfast, a coffee, loaded the washing machine and dryer with their first loads of the day, and cleared the washing up.

Perhaps I'll finally get the chance to read some of the blogs I try to follow, and to set off in search of a few new ones. If you arrive at this post having discovered a random comment from some strange English guy that's never commented on your blog before, now you know why.

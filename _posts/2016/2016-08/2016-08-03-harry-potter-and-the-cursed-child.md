After the mysterious failed delivery on Monday, I arrived back in the office this morning to discover an Amazon box propped in the crate of milk bottles outside the office door - with my name on the label. There was only one thing it could be.

I will admit to being greatly amused by the torrent of negative reviews on Amazon - from teens who either expected a novel, or who have never read a script before (do they no longer teach Shakespeare in school?).

I can quite happily relate that when I told our children I had ordered it - aged 15, 12 and 11 - Miss 12 immediately asked if they could stage their own production. I guess some children just "get it".

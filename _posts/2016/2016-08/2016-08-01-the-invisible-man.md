Let us all give thanks the Amazon delivery driver that"tried" to deliver my parcel this afternoon. Not only has he apparently borrowed an invisible delivery van from Wonder Woman, he has also perfected his ninja silent door knocking technique.

I guess I won't be reading the Harry Potter book tonight then.

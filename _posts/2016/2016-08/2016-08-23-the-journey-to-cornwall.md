After a day spent washing clothes and half-heartedly packing bags yesterday, this morning began with a much more concerted effort to throw every phone, iPad, Kindle, charger, and whatever the hell else into the back of the car before setting off towards my parents on the south-west coast. We also picked a few clothes up, but then realised en-route that we had forgotten an almost endless list of miscellaneous items.

After stopping en-route to sit on a patch of grass outside a motorway service station eating leftover food from home, we finally arrived in Cornwall a little after 4pm. There were hugs, laughter, wine, and the scenes you might imagine when you've not seen your parents for six months.

No sooner had we arrived and grabbed something to eat, myself, my other half, and our youngest daughter found ourselves walking the couple of miles down to the beach - to see the sea.

The coming days will bring sunshine, sea, sand, and hopefully little else. Time to switch off. Time to retract a little from a world of running here, there and everywhere. Time to read books, build sandcastles, eat icecreams, and laugh at each other's bad jokes.

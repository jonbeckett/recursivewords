It's the morning after the day before. Yesterday we got up early, threw food, drinks, buckets and spades into bags, and headed towards the beach under blue skies. I lost count of the number of times I went in the sea with the children. I still have a streaming cold, which is quite miraculous given the amount of seawater I've ingested in the last 72 hours.

While sitting on the beach drying out yesterday I occupied myself watching the bizarre mixture of people making the beach their home for the day. It struck me how wide a disparity there often is between couples - tall men with short ladies, short men with tall ladies, and strangely often large ladieswith skinny men.

Another thing has amused me over the last few days - the number of men with hulking upper bodies, and tattos on their calves - which would look great if their legs matched their upper bodies, but they usually don't - they have stick thin legs, and it looks pretty funny.

Anyway - I'm not generally one to judge others (particularly when my eldest daughter acts as the greatest leveller - constantly reminding me that I'm a special kind of idiot).

I have no idea what we're going to do today. I think a quiet day may be in store.

As you may have read a few days ago, I setup a Minecraft server on the internet for our kids and their friends to login to and share. As the administrator of the server, I naturally have"superpowers" - I can smite anybody at a moment's notice (which makes a laughing stock of Batman ever taking down Superman, but we'll ignore badly imagined comics that became laborious movies).

You know the biggest problem? I can't use the powers.

It feels like being Clarke Kent - knowing you have incredible powers, but not wanting to blow your cover - only in this case, it's more about not letting the kids become disheartened because you can magic anything out of your ass while they are spending hours crafting stuff

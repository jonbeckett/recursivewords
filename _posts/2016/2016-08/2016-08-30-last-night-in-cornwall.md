After a final day spent on the beach (we really cannot believe the weather we have had), we wandered into Looe this evening and had a family meal together. We sat in a 400 year old building and were served good old-fashioned stodgy meals. Afterwards we wandered along the sea front to an amusement arcade and spent our remaining loose change winning all manner of junk.

Tomorrow morning we will wander back into town once more, and pick up presents to take home - sticks of rock, fudge, cookies, and so on. After lunch we will throw everything in the car, and set off on the fivehour journey back towards home.

Returning to normal life will hopefully bring about a few more words published on this blog - no doubt complaining about anything and everything, but also hopefully recounting silly memories, idiotic ideas, and unfounded opinions.

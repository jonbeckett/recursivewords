The lady that lived opposite the office for the last several years has gone. Just like that. I arrived on my bike this morning, and the house stands empty. Even though we were never more than an occasional "hello" to each other on a morning or an evening, it feels weird.

I never even knew her name.

For the last several years she had a starring role in the imaginary soap opera in my head, involving the rich guy that lived next door, and his endless attempts to impress her - parking all manner of sports cars and motorcycles outside her house, and "just happening" to be be outside cleaning them at times she might wander past.

It's not going to be the same without her.

This evening we went on a family outing to watch the England women's team play against Serbia in a qualifying match for the European Championships. My other half had somehow ended up being in charge of acquiring tickets for all of the families connected with the youth football teams in town, and getting them into the hands of parents on match day at the football ground.

You would think - being gifted tickets to an international football match - that people would arrive on-time. You would also think that people that asked for tickets would bother to turn up. You would be wrong on both counts. Two entire families were late, and two other families just plain didn't turn up at all. Given that people had been asking if there were any tickets left, I was pretty furious - it's all I have been able to do NOT to out them all on Facebook, and berate them for their thoughtless, ignorant behaviour.

I overheard one family that was late talking behind me. Why do you think they were late arriving at an international football match, filled with heroes their children dream of one day being like? Because they didn't realise the time. Unbelievable.

How do some people even manage to survive? Perhaps they don't - knowing most of the families around here, they probably pay people to do everything for them - to remember things - to take people to places at the times they should be there - to keep promises for them - to pick things up and deliver things for them. I was quietly furious.

ANYWAYput themselves to bed. They fell asleep almost immediately - no doubt dreaming of running across the turf of a stadium with their heroes calling for the ball.

p.s. we have some amazing photos of the players with the kids

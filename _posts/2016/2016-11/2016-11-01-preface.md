After wondering what on earth I might write for NaNoWriMo this year, it finally dawned on me that an Autobiography might be a good idea. I have an entire universe of childhood stories to call upon, and might hopefully be able to tell many of the stories in a somewhat interesting way - to inject a little self deprecating humour here and there.

So - rather than recording the minutiae of every-day life for the next month, expect to start seeing stories about my early years, infant school, stories about long departed family members, and so on. I have no idea if I will write it chronologically, or jump around all over the place. I don't suppose it matters that much.

There will be stories about infant school teachers surviving car crashes, dogs eating frozen hamburgers, grandparents teaching songs we shouldn't have known, brothers with broken bones, senior school teachers losing the temper spectacularly, weekends spent running wild in pub gardens, and weekend news books from primary school inventing spectacular works of fiction.

It occurs to me that as I grow older, my memory is slowly but surely de-constructing itself - perhaps writing the stories down now will help preserve the more interesting times, people, and places that would otherwise be forgotten.

Now if you'll excuse me, I believe I have some writing to get on with...

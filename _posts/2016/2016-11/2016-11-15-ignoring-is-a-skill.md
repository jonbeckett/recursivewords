I spent 2000 to 2008 ignoring complaints about George W Bush, then spent the next 8 years ignoring people complain about Obama, and will probably have to spend the next 4 years ignoring people complaining about Trump.

Notice I'm not saying that I agree or disagree with either side - just that the world is bigger than some orange lunatic that can't keep his mouth shut.

I read a wonderful post by Stephen Levy a few days ago, where he brought the writers together at Conde Nast the morning after the US election, and reminded them that nobody remembers who the King of England was during the Industrial Revolution, and nobody remembers who the Prime Minister was when Joseph Bazalgette built the pumping stations that unwittingly wiped out Cholera in London.

By the same token, people will remember these years for injustice and disaster being reported via social media - informing the world within seconds of unfolding events. Those in charge at the time will be largely ignored.

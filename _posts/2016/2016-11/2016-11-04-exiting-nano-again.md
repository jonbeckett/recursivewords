This is beginning to be a pattern that repeats every year. I start NaNoWriMo, I get off to something of a flyer (I got to 25,000 words in 4 days this time), and then decide that actually I'm not really enjoying it, and pull the plug before I hate it too much.

I'll keep hold of everything I've written of course - I just won't be writing any more of it as a sprint - I'll dip back into it as the mood strikes me.

I guess the truth is I love blogging. I've always loved blogging. Perhaps instead of trying to do anything else related to writing (like writing a 50,000 word novel in November), I should just stick to what I like doing, and empty my head here each day.

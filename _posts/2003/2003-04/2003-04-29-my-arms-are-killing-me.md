I suppose I should have expected it, but my arms are absolutely killing me since I went to the Gym on sunday morning. Okay - it's two days later, and people always say that it's the second day the pain will show up, but I was pretty sore yesterday so thought I had got away with it.

At least if this is the worst of it, I can relax a little after today. I was hoping to go to the gym on Wednesday evening, but if my arms are still sore I'll have to postpone that and probably wait until next Sunday to go.

The down-side to all the pain is I can't concentrate on my work at all. It's a bit of a nightmare to be honest.

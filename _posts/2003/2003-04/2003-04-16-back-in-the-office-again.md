It's lunchtime, and I am back in the office at work once more.

Monday and Tuesday of this week I was working on a client site in East Grinstead - way across the other side of the country. The journey each day was definitely NOT fun.

The outward bound trip (on the train) was something like Marlow, Bourne End, Maidenhead, Paddington, (then on the tube) Victoria, (then on train again), East Grinstead.

The homeward trip was East Grinstead, London Bridge, (on the tube), St Johns Wood, Baker Street, Paddington, (back on the train), Maidenhead, Bourne End, Marlow.

Luckily I didn't have a long wait at any of the train stations, but last night I got as far as Maidenhead on the way home and was totally fed up so jumped into a taxi for the final leg home.

Back at work things are going pretty well. I'm still a bit stuck on what I'm going to come up with for a logo (freelance work I've become involved in). I'm thinking that to beat the other competitor I need to come up with a whole brand image - not just a logo. If I only come up with a logo, I may have problems integrating it into a webpage design. We shall see!

The last two days have basically seen no development of my webpage either, which is a bit of a problem - tonight is going to be a bit of a slog.

I really should try and update this Blog more often. It looks better when there are more entries 

The last few days have been something of a joke with regard to my internet presence. I have been working on-site a lot, and the internet connection at home has been dead - with the reasons best known to the BT ADSL engineers.

Something of note has happened this week though - some interest has been shown in the old LDMS system I started developing last year. I've started taking it out of mothballs and there is now a discussion forum for it at the PluggedOut Forums.

LDMS was intended to be a thin client Linux document management solution, but the development of the ThoughtCafe project swallowed up and the development effort, and eventually the code was folded completely into ThoughtCafe.

Anyway - other news this week is myself and my better half have joined the Gym in town - Gold memberships no less! I have to trog off down there on Sunday morning at 9am for my "induction". This was all kicked off when I stepped on the scales the other weekend and discovered to my horror that I appear to be developing my own gravity.

I wonder if you are heavy enough, that time slows down for you?

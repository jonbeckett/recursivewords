Last night I got in from work, tidied up a bit, then spent most of the evening installing a computer for a friend (well - an hour or so). I think the computer may have fallen off the back of a lorry, so was a bit worried about what I might find installed on it. In the end my fears were unfounded - it had been wiped completely clean - no structure on C drive even.

Anyway - after Indychick got in from work, I got on with the usual routine of tea, and then we dropped the computer off at it's real home 

Later when we got back I had a go on "Jak and Daxter" on the PS2, and managed to get through a bit that's had Indychick stuck for weeks - much to her chagrin. Then it was on to TOCA Race Driver to win the championships, then a quick blast on Vice City  Spent most of the time messing around looking for hidden packages.

We suddenly realised while I was playing this that it was 1:30am so packed it in - and then of course I overslept this morning. Well done Jonathan.

And here I am sat at my desk at work, at 10:30 (I did get here for 9am in the end), on my second coffee of the day, typing this complete and utter bilge into the blog.

There must be more to life than this?

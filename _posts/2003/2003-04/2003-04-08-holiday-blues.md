We got back from our holiday on Saturday night - after a nine hour drive from Scotland. We took it in turns to break the journey up, which worked quite well. W insisted on taking over from me on my last stint though - I was tired, making mistakes on junctions, and becoming quite dangerous probably  I did have to negotiate getting us out of Edinburgh the previous day though, which is probably enough to stress anybody out.

Scotland was wonderful - we're definitely going to go again, but maybe to a different area (I don't know if you're the same, but I don't understand people who go on holiday to the same place all the time).

Next year we're already thinking of going to Ireland, so in preparation I'm reading "Round Ireland with a Fridge" by Tony Hawks - and so far it's very good - one of the funniest books I've read in ages.

Anyway - better get on with doing a few things around here I suppose - back later!

This morning I had my "induction" session at the gym in town. I won't say I was exactly nervous (never having been to a gym before), but I was certainly aprehensive.

The session started with a chat with my instructor to go through my past history, and what I wanted to achieve, then I spent about 90 minutes going around the various machines, being shown what to do, and the instructor trying to figure out what I was capable of.

During the visit I had my first ever go on a running machine and was pleasantly surprised at being able to run on it straight away - for some reason I thought I was going to have real problems, but in the end I found it easy.

The only real after effects I have are in my arms - my arms are nowhere near as strong as my legs, due to a lot of cycling. I think I'm going to have to do a lot of work to get them anywhere near the level of my legs... ah well 

The main goal (apart from getting fit) is just to get into the routine of going to the gym. I have never done any regular organised fitness activity (unless you count playing badminton with the company I used to work for), so the main thing is to see if I keep at it.

Anyway. It's Sunday, and we still have no ADSL connection at home - therefore the pluggedout website is stalled and this posting is reaching the net via a laptop dialup connection.

Oh - good news for the day is that the TV I used to have the PS2 connected to isn't broken after all, so the games room is back in operation once more.

I think that will do for now!

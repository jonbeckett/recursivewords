It's the third of December and this is my first blog entry for a couple of weeks. I guess I should make a bit more of an effort really...

I've been playing chess quite a bit lately (no news there then...), and picking away at my "Content Management System" - I am writing a website creation tool that people will be able to install on their website, and then allow non skilled people (like salesmen, etc) to update the content of the site themselves - avoiding the costs usually associated with it.

Over the last few weeks work has been quite slow. I am in-between major projects so have no long term aims. While it's good to have some time for research and development for a change, I know if some of the recent contract bids come in, the new year is going to be hell on earth.

Anyway - I'm supposed to be packing up fairly soon to go home, so will write something tomorrow if I get a chance.

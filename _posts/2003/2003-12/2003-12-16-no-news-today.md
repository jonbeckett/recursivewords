Woudln't it be great if you switched the news on one day, and the newsreader said "There is no news today, so we will be showing Will and Grace an hour early."

Does it annoy you that all the news is bad news? Is good news not newsworthy any more? Could they not tell us about something great that has happened, or something unusual? Why does all the news have to be disasters? Do they not realise that if they didn't report on terrorists then they would lose the point to terrorising anybody? (i.e. nobody would take any notice).

I'm in a bit of a funny mood really, aren't I. Oh well.

This weekend we went out to dinner with my aunt and cousin to celebrate her 18th birthday. Following that we stayed over at my brother's house on Friday night, then throughout the day on Saturday (I built my nephew some excellent planes and ships out of lego, even if I do say so myself).

We got home late on Saturday and then indychick had a bit of a christmas cooking frenzy - hundreds of mince pies  While she was doing that I went into town and got more groceries, some flowers to put around the house, and the new Simpsons PS2 game for us to play. I'm not the biggest fan of the simpsons, but she is so it was great to see her laughing like a drain at the game - even I have to admit it has it's moments.

This week at work is really quiet. I'm expecting to get called to go on-site at one of our clients any day this week, but we have heard nothing from them all week. Have to see how it goes.

Hilight of today has been the discovery that the DjVu technology has been made open-source. We can therefore put the engine into our own stuff completely free of charge!! (which will help PostXPress no end).

Oh - while messing around on the internet at lunchtime I found a site called freewarepalm.com - guess who filled his palm organiser up with games and crap 

I guess in closing I should mention that I have done nothing to the blog or CMS projects in the last week... it's good to see that people seem to be using Blog though

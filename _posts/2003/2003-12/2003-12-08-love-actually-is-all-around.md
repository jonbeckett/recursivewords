I seem to find less and less time to put entries into my Blog... to be honest I think it has something to do with me being a Pisces. I tend to drift like the wind most of the time - becoming interested in doing one thing, then moving on to the next, and re-visiting interests every so often.

Anyway... what did I get up to this weekend?

On Saturday myself and indychick spent most of the morning out in the Garden - I dug a trench for the hedgerow we are planting, and indychick put them in place. I was dreading digging the trench, but with all the wet weather we have been having it was really easy.

The one problem I did have was launching the shovel into the ground at one point to break through a root, and hitting stone... how I didn't break my wrist I'll never know. It hurt like hell for the next couple of days.

Last night we went out to the cinema to see "Love Actually". I thought it was fantastic, but then I always like soppy films. It's a very good "Christmas" movie, with a stellar cast. Bill Nigh stole the show as "Billy Mack", and the guy from "The Office" was fantastic in it too... I could go on an on, but I don't want to wreck the film for others who go and see it.

Anyway - nearly time to go home!

Today I am sat at home with a pretty horrid cold... one of the people I work with brought it in, and somehow I managed to catch it. I must hold the world record at the moment for catching bad colds - I've probably had about ten in the last year!

I knew I was going down with something on the way home last night - riding my bike home seemed like much more hard work than normal (I ride a mountain bike to work and back - it's about 3 miles away), and then by late evening my head was starting to clog up.

This morning I am pretty much useless. It's all I can do to write these few bits in here. I'm probably running at zero concentration today...

I'm off to make a cup of tea anyway.

I'll update here when I have a bit more energy and will to do anything other than feel crap

I am back working in the office today, after a couple of days working in Swindon. The one great thing that I got out of the last couple of days was reading "Hackers" by Stephen Levy while commuting back and forth from the client site.

Hackers is a great book (although more often than not I always think the book I'm reading is great). It tells the story of the "mass market" computer revolution that happened from the days of the early PDP machines at MIT right through to the emergence of people like Wozniak, Jobs, and Gates.

Reading the book has kind of reminded me how much I enjoy writing computer software, and how long it has been since I wrote anything "just for fun". When I was in college I would always be writing various pieces of software just to figure out "how". Perhaps I'll go and pick up the programming for my chess engine one day soon and see if I can get it to play a half decent game...

Anyway - here I sit bashing this text into my Blog. The sun is shining outside, the office is becoming very hot indeed, and I really don't have a lot to do in advance of my trip to another client site tomorrow.

I'm sure somebody else will find something for me to do if they find out though.

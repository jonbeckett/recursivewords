I'm back at work today (and not feeling too clever, it has to be said). My powers of healing seem to be about as good as usual though - I was really bad for about a day, and then have got better really quickly.

Today at work stupidity seems to reign. Perhaps it's that "Friday Feeling". For some reason we started coming out with stupid super hero names - like "Septic Sid", and "Festering Fred".... but I think we are all agreed that the best one so far with the most potential to tell stories about is "Snot Boy".

Reading the above, you are probably wondering just how childish I can be at times, and you'd have to wonder pretty hard. I can be incredibly stupid at times. I think Indychick despair's of me now and again... take this morning for instance - I was getting ready for work and walked into a room to pick something up. Indychick asked me something as I walked by, and I completely forgot what I was doing... it took me a good few seconds to rewind and figure out where I was going again.

Anyway - enough of my idiocy.

This evening I may be wandering around to my mates house to get my Amiga working at last. I have an A600, a hard drive, and the cable for it - so we're going to see if we can get it to boot up properly. If it does work, it will give me a computer to use for messing around on with programming, playing retro games, and so on.

Did I mention that my SNES has broken? Well - it's not broken as such - the cartridge slot is damaged. If you wiggle the cartridges when they are in, the machine locks up. Looks like I'll have to get another one on E-Bay...

Ho hum. It's Friday and it looks like it's nearly the end of the day (17:14 as I type this). I think our only plans for the weekend are to visit my brother tomorrow afternoon, and go out for tea with family tomorrow night. Should be a laugh!

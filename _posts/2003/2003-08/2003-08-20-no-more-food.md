We went out for dinner last night with some friends to a local pub that has started doing a "curry night". We arrived at about half past seven, to find that the place was absolutely packed to the rafters - and then discovered when we went to order our food a few minutes later that the kitchen were taking no more orders because they ran out of food!

We ended up going to the local chip shop (which happens to be next door to the off-license), and then went back to our friends house...

Although it was a bit annoying, we didn't mind too much because we know the guy who owns the pub, and know that they were only trying this curry night to turn their quietest night of the week into a more busy one - obviously successfully. I think we'll go again next week but try to get there a lot earlierhas been fairly hum-drum. I went on-site in Hillingdon yesterday morning (and came back in the afternoon), then spent the afternoon working on help calls once again.

Oh - last comment for today - I had a puncture on my bike the day before yesterday. I fixed it early this morning before coming to work. I got off my bike at work this morning, and have another puncture... go figure.

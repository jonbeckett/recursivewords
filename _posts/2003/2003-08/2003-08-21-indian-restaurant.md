We went to the "Tiger Garden" indian restaurant in town last night - my Aunt from America was staying over before flying home, so took us out for something to eat 

As per usual I ate enough for a small african nation, but then I did skip lunch (work has been slightly mental - the helpdesk has turned into a full time wade through treacle). The food was fantastic, and after the day I had, the Cobra beer was exactly what the doctor ordered.

My aunt left for the airport at 6 this morning, and I guess I woke up when she did because Indychick got up too - so there we were, downstairs at 6:30am wondering what to do with ourselves for a couple of hours before we had to go to work... somehow the lure of breakfast time TV took over so we just sat and watched it (while drinking several cups of tea).

Isn't it amazing how time can just be eaten up doing nothing?

Anyway - today at work the office is pretty dead and I am trying to deal with another hail of help calls. I really am getting nowhere fast. It's almost funny.

I think the plan tonight is to do as little as possible. I may try and tidy up in the study a bit - at the moment it looks like an explosion in a computer factory, due to my normal desktop PC packing up a couple of nights ago.

Here's the general gist of what happened... (don't laugh)

Tried booting PC. It made a sound like the millenium falcon starting up, and then sounded just like the Millenium Falcon stalling... I removed the power supply from the Linux crappo-but-reliable machine and put it in the dead XP desktop machine... same again... I tried re-seating the processor in the dead XP machine. Same results. I rip the innards from the dead machine, and start building the crappo-but-about-to-be-better Linux machine into a far more powerful beast. I boot up the Linux machine and it does nothing. I re-attach the IDE cable of the XP hard drive to the Linux machine, this time putting it the right way up. I boot up the Linux machine... it tries to load Windows XP. I power it straight down. I find a jumper from somewhere in the dead computer, and make sure that the XP hard drive thinks it's a slave. I boot up Linux, and WEHEY - we are in business. I can even mount the XP drive and browse it via a terminal logon. I expose the /mnt folder through Samba and try to connect the laptop to see it... unsucessfully. Ten minutes later, I realise that the Linux machine has no network cable in the back of it...doh! Another ten minutes, and the laptop can see the Linux machine on the network neighborhood... I now discover that Linux will not share an NTFS drive's contents through Samba onto the network. Damn and blast. I set about copying the contents of the XP drive to the Linux local file system. Next discovery is that I don't have access to copy the damn files from the Linux machine. One CHMOD later and they are all copying... I save the world... well... my hard drive's contents.

AAAaaanyway....

I'm starting to rely on Linux more and more over Microsoft. For the uses I ever put a computer to, Linux does just about everything I want. I'll still keep Windows around though in order to write apps and stuff for people.

Time for a cup of tea...

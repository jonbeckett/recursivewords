On Wednesday this week, myself and my father-in-law went on a "Hawk Flying Experience" day at the Andover Hawk Conservancy (www.hawk-conservancy.org).

The day started at 10 with a talk from our tutors for the day (a Falconer and an assistant), then we were straight into the handling and flying of the birds...

Throughout the day we got to fly, catch and feed a number of birds of prey, including Black Kites, Harris Hawks and a Balateur Eagle. We also went behind the scenes in the hospital, and in numerous aviaries to see birds like Vultures and Owls up close.

During the day we saw a couple of flying displays - of various Kites, Owls, Eagles, Vultures, and at the end of the day we got to see the famous "Perigrin Falcon" strut it's stuff.

Seeing some of the big Eagles, Vultures and the Perigrinne really was something else. I believe they said the Perigrinne Falcon made it's entry across the field at about 140mph... and stooped in later in the show at about 180mph.

Although we didn't see any "mishaps" ourselves (either while flying the birds, or watching the display), we did get to hear some great annecdotes about the Perigrinne. Apparently, while the falcon is soaring above the field waiting for the lure to be thrown, a stupid pigeon will occaisionally take flight. If the two birds are within half a mile of each other - the pigeon is basically dead.

Apparently, the Falconer's experience is that regardless of the make-up of the audience - Vegetarians, Vegans, Pacifists - they suddenly are all rooting for the Falcon, willing it to make it's kill... and then they discover what happens when a Falcon hits a pigeon at 150mph+

Typically the pigeon's head comes off, and it's guts get sprayed across a liberal area...

The audience nearly always react with instant horror (as against their bloodthirstyness a second earlier), and can be heard saying how awful, and barbaric it was...

When I got up this morning I really didn't want to go to work. I was up at 7am, and sat watching breakfast television for a while. Eventually I gave myself a kick up the backside and got ready for work, but only really because I knew I would get into trouble if I stayed home.

It's funny - you hear about the idea of "Duvet Days" in people's contract of employment from time to time, but if anybody really had them, you would still get winged at if you decided to take one. Although getting up was difficult, once I got out of the house and made my way to work I felt okay. I guess because I am not working on a major project at the moment, I have something of a motivation problem.

I spent a while last night looking at the Underdogs website on the net (search for "The Underdogs" on google), and downloaded some old games that I used to own years ago. It's a bit of a problem getting them running on modern hardware and operating systems, but after a bit of tinkering you too can be playing "Beneath a Steel Sky" in a window on your desktop 

I don't know how many people have run across it yet, but there is a huge swathe of old software available for downloading on the internet that has become termed "abandonware" - meaning that the original authors are no longer in business, or the copyright has lapsed. You can therefore go and download various programs and games for free now since about 1991.

Although last night was spent playing computer games, tonight will probably be spent tidying the house up. It's a bit of a tip at the moment - basically because we both have too many interests, and both get sucked into computer games (like Settlers 2). We seem to have a blitz about once a week, and then everything goes backwards for the rest of the week. Don't get me wrong - our house never looks like a tip, but it certainly looks lived in most of the time. Everybody who visits loves it though because they say they can relax - it's not like we ever put on a big show.

Anyway - I'm sat here writing this and an alarm has just appeared on my screen reminding me to fill out my timesheet on Livelink (we use Opentext Livelink in the office to store and track everything - I hate it with a vengeance).

Ho-hum. I guess it's nearly the end of the working day once more. Hopefully the meeting in the morning about the new workflow project will be a bit more exciting than the last few days have been...

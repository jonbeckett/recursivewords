Is it time to own up to the Diarist exploit that's put me on top of the referrals list?

It's worth mentioning that this diary entry is not advocating that anbody else try this - I am informing the diarist.net people of the weakness in their system, and will be helping them fix it.

Normally I would write about what I've been up to in this blog, but today's entry covers the means and method for exploiting a scripted ranking system (such as Diarist.Net). I will be switching off the exploit in a couple of days time...

To be honest, I'm really surprised that nobody has done this before - I'm expecting they have, because all top-rank sites can suffer from the same problem as the one I have exploited.

Here's how it works...

You really thought I was going to tell you, didn't you  Can you imagine how much trouble I would get into if I published the exploit?

I'll probably write more in here if I can come up with a sensible fix for the exploit, but I'm not so sure there is one (which is very worrying for any ranking type site).

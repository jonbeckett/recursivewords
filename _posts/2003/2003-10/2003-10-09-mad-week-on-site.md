It's been a pretty mad week once again.

Monday and Tuesday were filled with the installation of Redhat Linux 9 on a test server in the office for an upcoming Linux development effort. We now have the grand total of 2 Linux servers intended for development, and a growing number of virtual machines.

Following that, yesterday I was in Chesham visiting a client site to do a product upgrade, and today I was in Swindon finalising a change request at another client site.

I think next week I'm scheduled for a visit into the city, and yet another visit to Amersham to do yet another change request.

When will it stop?

Last night we went to the pub for a meal - I had chicken fajitas, indychick had vegetable chimichanga. It was great - especially after a crappy day at work. Tonight we've been invited to a friend's house for a meal, and tomorrow night we've got friends over for a meal at our house 

It really doesn't stop for us at the moment, does it...

I think I get Saturday (daytime) to do what I want this week!

For some ridiculous reason, one of my best friends on the internet has talked me into taking part in the nanowrimo competition.

Basically, nanowrimo (www.nanowrimo.org) is a yearly gathering of lunatics who try and write a 50,000 word novel inside one calendar month.

I've always wanted to write a novel, and this seems like a good excuse to do something a bit mad (I think Tony Hawks defined it as ATDSABS syndrome - "about to do something a bit silly" syndrome). Looking at it now, you only have to pump out a couple of thousand words a day to meet the deadline, but I guess if you miss a day or two then you suddenly find yourself with ten thousand to write at one sitting (not easy!).

Anyway - indychick has promised to buy me a Nanowrimo t-shirt if I successfully complete my book, so I have to do it now 

Of course it's sods law that work will go mad over the next month, leaving me with little or no time to write my book. I guess I'll have to get up early to do an hour's writing or something...

Anyway... I have two days to come up with a decent plot.

If you're interested in following the story as I write it, I'll be posting here in the blog probably, and the body text of the story will be available at the following url;

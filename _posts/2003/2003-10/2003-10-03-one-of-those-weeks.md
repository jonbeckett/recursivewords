It's been a strange week really.

I've been rushing around doing bits and pieces of various projects for a while now - and suddenly I find that all those small projects are coming to an end, leaving me at a loss of what to get on with next.

I guess the major event this week was a visit to client site in London on Thursday to complete a support call. The client had experienced a hardware failure, and what started as a bit of phone support turned into me being on-site for an entire day re-building and upgrading their system from scratch. Not fun. Especially when you want to go home and they are all in a meeting 5 floors below somewhere, and you haven't got a clue where they are.

Today was spent sorting out a minor problem with the system I worked on in London. It took all morning just to build a virtual machine that looked something like theirs, then within two minutes I had replicated the problem and could continue working on it. Typical...

ANYWAYhave no plans.

Does this mean I can actually go swanning off wherever I want tomorrow? Hmmm... where could I go. The choices would be something along the lines of Wycombe (where I know they have a really good game shop now), or maybe even into London on the train... I'll wait and see I think.

Last night indychick was at her book group so I found myself on my own for the evening. I managed to spend 90% of it messing around with ThoughtCafe once more - adding new features and clearing up things that should have been fixed a long time ago.

Today is another day on-site. I left the house at 6:55 to catch the 7:15 train from Marlow, changing at Maidenhead and then on to Paddington.

I found myself falling asleep on the way to Paddington and had to stop reading my book (some trash by Anne McCaffrey that I picked up when I left the house this morning - about people with paranormal mental abilities or something).

Anyway - after reaching Paddington, ambled into the tube station and caught my train to Blackfriars. I picked up a copy of "The Metro" on the way (the free Central London newspaper), and wondered if I could make a worse newspaper with less interesting "news" in it. The thought then struck me that perhaps "The Metro" is designed to be read from start to finish in the time it takes to go through about 5 or 6 subway stations... hmmm....

Quick walk across the bridge at Blackfriars and a right turn (do you know where I am yet?) and I arrived at the client offices - only to find out that none of the three people I know were in yet.

What is it with London and people turning up late for work? The rest of the country arrive before the time they are supposed to start, but not in London... oh no.

After a quick chat with the people on reception I decided that maybe it would be a good idea if I dissappeared for half an hour and went and found somewhere to have some breakfast or something. After a couple of minutes I found just the place - a "Pret a Manger" just down the round. Chocolate Croissants are sooo good 

So - here I am (finally) at a desk within a very large company on the south bank of the Thames, and I'm waiting for an FTP download of some software to complete. I have nothing to do until that is complete... aarrggghhh.

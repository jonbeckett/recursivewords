It's 10:45am on Saturday morning, and I'm sitting at the laptop starting work on a website for my cousin in San Francisco (reminder : I'm in the UK).

My cousin runs an organic produce delivery company in and around SF called "Betty's Organics". It was started by her mum, and so far has used an old Macintosh with FileMaker on it to keep the records in check. I'll be giving her a php/mysql website to do everything.

Anyway - I have to go and organise some webspace, and start work on designing the database. I tend to hand-write websites rather than use any visual tools, so today will mostly be spent using textpad to sketch out the basics of the site - user accounts, orders and so on.

Anybody that reads this blog must think my life is completely absorbed by computers and the IT industry - and I guess for the most part they would be right. Sad, isn't it. Perhaps I should make time to do other things in my life to have a bit of a change from time to time... I am my own worst enemy though - at the moment our spare room has a pile of books across the couch with titles like "C++ Unleashed".

I might wander into town a bit later on to buy today's newspaper...

What a boring blog entry...

p.s. I am cheating on the CLIX list... I'll switch the cheat off this morning. Can you believe I emailed them to tell them exactly what I was doing and they took NO notice?

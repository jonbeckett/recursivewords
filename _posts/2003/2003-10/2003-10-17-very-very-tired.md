Today is Friday, and I am extremely tired. What's worse, I have no prospect of a break until next weekend. Do you ever feel like the world is becoming unfair?

Last week I was on-site twice, and this week I have been working on-site twice again. Each site visit was a full day, which really means half a day before and after too, to prepare for the visit, and to document results on return. Usually working on-site means getting there for the start of office hours, so I leave home at 7am. Add to that the fact that we've been out or busy every night this week, that we will again be busy tonight, and that we are going to be out all weekend, and you start to understand the tone of this entry.

I keep fighting myself - on Tuesday night we went out with friends for a curry, and I actually found myself apologising to them early in the evening in case I looked tired or yawned (I had been working in London all day).

Tonight we are having friends round for dinner. I know it sounds awful, but I'm really not looking forward to it. I'm just so tired.

I would really love to spend the weekend doing what I want to do (working on a new version of my open source diary solution), but already I am spending Saturday re-installing my wife's parent's computer, and on Sunday I am helping to marshall the Abingdon Marathon.

When will it be my turn to do what I want?

The last couple of weeks have been pretty busy for me (hence no entries in this blog).

In between visiting customer sites in East Grinstead, Amersham and Hillingdon, I have been working away on helpdesk calls and new development for a number of projects. To be honest, it's getting a bit silly - I can't remember the last day I worked on one project. I find myself juggling five balls all the time, which can't be good for stopping mistakes and so on.

I've found myself playing chess once more! Following a night setting one of my friends up to play chess on the internet, I've played a few games myself and been soundly beaten in just about every game. I used to be quite good at chess, but not any more by the looks of things.

Anyway... thought for the day I suppose... I was travelling home on the train yesterday from East Grinstead (place Patrick Moore was born by the way), and noticed on the London Underground that hardly anybody on the train was wearing a wedding ring. I don't know why I noticed, but it just seemed strange - and so many of the people were in their mid 30s too. Perhaps the world is changing?

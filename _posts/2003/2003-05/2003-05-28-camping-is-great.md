We went camping over the weekend (and I had yesterday off - 4 day weekend 

We stayed on a campsite near a village called Priddy in the Mendip hills (south west England), not far from Glastonbury and Cheddar. On Friday the weather forecast said we were going to experience something along the lines of fire, brimstone and thunderbolts, but in the end we had pretty fine weather every day.

It's funny - on the way down I was warned that Cheddar (famous for it's "Gorge" and "Cheese" I suppose) was going to be a let-down. Boy was everybody right. Cheddar consists of some pretty boring public-access caves, a pretty large cutting through the hills with a dangerous road, three hundred tacky gift shops, and thirty thousand old age pensioners getting in everybody's way.

To say I was mildly annoyed by the time we'd spent five minutes in Cheddar was an understatement - although the weekend did get better from that point forwards.

Over the next couple of days we went walking both into the Mendip hills, and to visit Glastonbury Abbey and Tor. The Mendips were quite good and we made it to the top of the highest hill - not exactly in the same bracket as Scafell or Blencathra in the lake district, but it's a pretty big... ummm... hill.... really. You can see Wales from it 

Glastonbury Abbey was quite interesting - even if for it's size rather than anything else. An interesting plaque 50 yards from the high alter tells you that it was "said to" be the burial place of King Arthur and Queen Guinevere, but I think "said to" is the key phrase there, seeing that Arthur's existence has never been proven.

The Tor was... ummm... high? Pretty good views of an ice cream van in the valley below too 

Today I am back at work (hence writing this to avoid doing any real work during lunchtime). God I'm bored. Really really bored.

I have found a good forum on the internet today though - http://www.rllmuk.co.uk/perl/phpBB - it's for people who play too many computer games (like I wish I had time to do).

Anyway. Coffee time I think...

Today I am relaxed. I wouldn't say the work I have been doing is easy, but it's not exactly difficult either. I'm writing a migration program to turn a datafile and several tens of thousands of single page TIF files into multi-page TIF files and meta-data files. The visit to client site to push the files into their document management system isn't until next week.

Alongside work I've been playing with Linux again on my old laptop. It says something that a 366Mhz P2 with 64Mb memory can run Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP , XWindows and Mozilla without any trouble. Talk about a portable development platform 

Meanwhile, the new laptop at home is being hogged by my other half who is playing "Heroes of Might and Magic" (that I got on a budget label last weekend for her). People think I am the computer game nut, but being honest it's the other way round - she plays the games, I fiddle with the techie stuff. I guess I really am a geek 

In the absence of a chance to go to the gym this week (due to lots of visitors basically), I'm going to go down there tonight after work. Last night I had a bit of a session on the exercise bike and ab trainer at home, but it's not the same. You don't get to see fit women in Lycra either 

Anyway - better get on with my work!

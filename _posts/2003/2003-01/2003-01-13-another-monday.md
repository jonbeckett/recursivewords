It's another Monday and I'm back at work after a week off enjoying time at home decorating and working on the new ThoughtCafe website.

Somehow nothing managed to happen while I was away, and the one call I had to resolve was very quick indeed. Ho hum. I did find out though that I'm travelling to East Grinstead first thing tomorrow to visit one of our clients. Quite how I'm going to make my work there look like half a day is anybody's guess - and I have to evade the woman there who was rather too friendly last time. Guess I should be flattered really.

It must say something about my tired state that I cannot think of anything ludicrous or stupid to write about (normally I'm a fount of stupidity).

Off to surf the web for the rest of lunchtime I suppose...

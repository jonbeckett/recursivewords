It's monday afternoon and I'm sat here after having read a number of comments on my own blog from a rather colourful character who seems to have rather too much time on his hands 

It really makes you wonder why some people choose to spend their free time in such a negative manner.

AnywayWhat a sad thing to have as a "skill" on your CV - "wallpapering".

You can see it in an interview now -

"What other skills do you have that you feel would help in the role of thin client developer at Fujitsu?"

"I'm quite good at wallpapering!"

Hmmm... I'm hungry. Food. I must have food.

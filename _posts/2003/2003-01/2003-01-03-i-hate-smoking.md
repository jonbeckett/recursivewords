It's been a funny kind of day today so far - I got up a bit later than normal and got a lift into work with my infinitely superior other half (IndyChick), then figured out that the stuff I had been scared about starting was nowhere near as bad as I had originally thought (yes that's right - I'm a software developer who is scared of complex stuff).

The morning passed by pretty quietly, then I went into town with one of my colleagues - who I cannot think of a pseudonim for in this diary (he has been likened to one of the Antyll mob from Penelope Pitstop, so if anybody knows his name let me know).

We went to the "Red Lion" for lunch and tried out their new StoneBaked Pizzas - amazingly cheap and tasted great too. I shall have to take IndyChick there soon. Apparently on a tuesday night they have two pizzas for the price of oneis people smoking. There should be some kind of law that if somebody wants to smoke in a pub they have to pay everybody in there some money to clean their clothes afterwards - because they make everybody stink... I didn't used to notice it very much but I'm slowly getting worse and worse. When I get home I have to change my clothes usually.

Then if anybody gets cancer from passive smoking in the years to come they can sue the arse off whoever they know who smokes. Quite why people blame the tobacco companies I will never know - it's the idiots that smoke that cause the problem.

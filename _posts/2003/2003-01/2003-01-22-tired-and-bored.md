If anybody that reads this is wondering why there is such a huge gap between entries, it's because I've just been so damn busy!

I've just completed the principal development work for a contract at work, and need to test it thoroughly this afternoon (booooring). I've been working on it since just before Christmas, and I'll be pretty glad to get it installed (next Tuesday!) and see the back of it.

At home of course I have been working on the replacement for ThoughtCafe, and have imposed something of a deadline on myself of this coming Sunday. So far I've worked about 20 hours on it this week during the evenings... last night I was up until 2am.

It's so dangerous at the moment - every time I get past one section of the development, I realise I could have done a previous section a better way. I'm going to have to draw the line from this point until "go live" and just get it out the door - I can re-code things later.

Indychick just called to tell me the laptop at home has packed up - I'm hoping it isn't terminal. Sounds like an overheating problem (it froze), so finger crossed on that one. If we have lost it we can't afford a new one for a long time - we have too many debts at the moment.

This post seems very "bitty" today, doesn't it... I guess I have too many things on my mind.

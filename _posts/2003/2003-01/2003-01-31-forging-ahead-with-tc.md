After a week of concentrated effort, the new ThoughtCafe site code is becoming more stable, and the bugs are falling out as I work on it.

It's nice to finally be working on a running project with Linux, MySQL and PHP. The difference in stability and performance over Windows cannot be measured - we were getting two or three server failures a week with Win2K, and so far we have not had a single problem.

Tonight is going to be fun - the domains have moved around for both TC Evo and the old ThoughtCafe site. I wonder how long it will take (with ADSL) to move everything...

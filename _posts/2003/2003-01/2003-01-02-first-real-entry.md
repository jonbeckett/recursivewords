I suppose "technically" I have missed posting an entry into this online diary for the first of January, because it took longer than 40 minutes to get the initial pieces of the PHP code working.

What I now have is technically okay though, so I'll slowly add to it over the coming weeks (when I get a chance), and maybe even publish the project on SourceForge as an open source BLOG solution.

I guess this will do for now. Obvious things that are going to be needed for the future are a "Cast of Characters", describing the various pseudonyms I'm going to use to represent people I know, and of course the facility to let people comment on the diary entries.

We'll see how it goes I guess.

Blimey - it's nearly 1am and I have work in the morning...

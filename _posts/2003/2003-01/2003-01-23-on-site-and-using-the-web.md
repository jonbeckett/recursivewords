Today has been a long day already.

We finally got to bed last night at about 2am (again), and I had to get up to catch the 7:15 train out of Marlow to visit a client site. I woke up with the alarm at about 6am, then tried desperately - in vain - to slow time down.

I finally got up and just got out of the house in time to catch the train. Arrived in Swindon a bit early, so grabbed a coffee from a place near the station before arriving on-site.

I have to admit I was a bit apprehensive today - the customer has screwed their system, and I am here to fix it. The blame is pretty squarely at their doorstep, but how do you tell them that? You don't. I was presently surprised to find everybody welcoming and congenial - made the whole day a lot better.

It turned out they really had screwed the system, but weren't about to admit to it. I therefore just went through the motions of checking everything and putting things back how they should have been... they appear grateful at least.

Now I have to test the system out throughout the afternoon and see what happens to it...

God, it's going to be 9 oclock before I get home...

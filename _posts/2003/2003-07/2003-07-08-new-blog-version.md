Hi all,

In between doing real work, I found time this lunchtime to finally add an "admin" page to the blog script, giving newbies the facilities to add, edit and remove blog entries from a central place.

It uses the password login from the config file, and for those who have already modded their Blog installations, you only need to copy the admin.php and admin_exec.php files.

The admin_exec file is a pretty good example of how to encapsulate lots of functions into one file (typical use when you have more than one function available from a page and don't want lots of php files floating around).

Apart from the Blog stuff, I have been mildly surprised how well I'm coping with the jetlag from the San Francisco flight. I'm curiously tired all day, but haven't had the falling asleep tiredness that I was maybe expecting. I must be getting better at this or something.

Last night I went out and bought myself a new mountain bike at last, so work is now 15 minutes away instead of 45 minutes by foot. The bike is a full suspension model, and was the cheapest one they had in the shop. It's only intended for getting me to work and back, so I'm pretty pleased with it - I wasn't expecting to get half the bike for that kind of money.

This week is already stacking up with stuff - it's looking more and more desperate for ThoughtCafe - the site is doing so well that we're almost being forced into moving to a different host because of crippling server fees. Just this month we're having to cover more than the yearly cost of hosting it elsewhere...

Anyway - today is a busy day (I'm about to install VisualStudio.NET on my work computer) so I better get on.

If you get stuck at all with the blog stuff, just ask in the discussion forum (http://www.pluggedout.com/forums/viewforum.php?f=5).

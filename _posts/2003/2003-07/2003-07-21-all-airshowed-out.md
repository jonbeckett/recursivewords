I went to Fairford "Royal International Air Tattoo" with my brother on Sunday. Apparently officionado's call it "RIAT". I think I'll call it an Airshow.

We rode bikes from my brother's house to the air base about 12 miles away (according to my brother's cycling computer). I think that's probably the furthest I've ridden my bike in 4 years  The last major bike ride I did was a 50 mile tour of Oxford for the Anthony Nolan Bone Marrow Trust, and I didn't even do it for the charity - just did it to see if I could.

I was quite surprised at the end of the day how much energy I still had in my legs after so long without really cycling any distance. I'm probably only 30% towards the level I was at once upon a time, but I was still good enough to keep up with my brother.

The Airshowwas a fast pass by the B1-B (just do a search on google if you want to see what it looks like). Apparently it's NATO codename is the "Bone" 

Anyway - back at work today and trudging through the various stuff I have to do. This week isn't looking too busy yet - I bet that's going to be famous last words...

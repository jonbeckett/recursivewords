This week has been a bit of a nightmare. It's Friday already and I feel like it's about Wednesday... it's just been one of those weeks.

I heard on Wednesday that I have to go to Manchester on Monday and Tuesday (4 hours away on the Train). That's going to be fun - not. I'm working as a consultant at a big company in Manchester for two days - because they are going live with a project and their normal guy is on holiday. Apparently I have to be very careful because we didn't actually build their system (I'll have to make sure I don't criticise what they have done).

It could be a long, boring couple of days. Then again, it could be a hectic, stressed couple of days. I shall take a couple of good books with me and see what happens.

Last night I replaced the bulletin board systems on my Brother's and Dad's websites. I used the Invision bulletin board system, chiefly because it allows uploads - so they can have picture galleries for example. I know my Dad will go mad when he sees it - he's been after something like it for absolutely ages.

Anyway - I suppose I had better get on with some work! There went my coffee break

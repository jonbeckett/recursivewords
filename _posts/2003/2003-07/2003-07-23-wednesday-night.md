It's wednesday night, and I'm sat here fiddling around with the code that makes up the page you are reading right now. I'm worried that the whole thing is a bit boring and "corporate" looking - hence the sudden appearance of pictures.

I'm betting on people e-mailing me now saying that the downloadable version of Blog doesn't have any of the whizzy new features, but then that's the nature of people in general, isn't it - be as pissed off as they can as often and for as long as they can. Perhaps I'll leave the blog script with the level of functionality it has, and encourage people to make their own modifications.

Work today was pretty hectic. I'm working on a pre-sale demo for an "e-Procurement" system for a rather large company (multi-national). Normally you would get several weeks to turn out such a demo, but oh-no. Not where I work. I've got one and a half days. Luckily I am pretty good at faking things, but it's still going to be bit of a rough job. Not so much "smoke and mirrors" as "fog and polished tin".

On top of that, I am the only person doing help desk at the moment too - and we've had four calls in so far - all of which I've not had time to spend on. Watching four other members of staff stumbling through a customer support call (the blind leading the blind) wasn't particularly nice... in the end it would have been far quicker if I had just handled the call myself. They called me for assistance four or five times anyway.

Am I sounding boring and monotonous yet? I should be. This is the nature of my life at the moment. Boring. Slow. Monotonous. Lack of excitement. Apart from Indychick that is. She is the one constant that is good - my happy thoughts. She drags me away from myself. I am after all, my own worst enemy.

God this room is a mess.

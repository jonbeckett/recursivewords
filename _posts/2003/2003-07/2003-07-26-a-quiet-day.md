It's Saturday afternoon and my only contribution to the world for the day (so far) was to walk into town this morning and buy a newspaper...

I wandered into WHSmiths and decided their new layout is incredibly poor. The shop looks much more roomy than it did before; but that's because they have far less stock than before. I moseyed around the various CDs, DVDs and computer games before deciding that I didn't really want anything and continued on to the next shop.

Marlow has quite possibly the most useless bookshop in the world ever. Perhaps I'm being a bit hard on it. We have this bookshop called "Horizons", and they have the problem that they still exist. If you're wondering what I mean, Marlow used to have a fantastic bookshop called "Bookends", where you could dissappear for a good hour looking around the various isles of new and second hand books.

In a typical example of small town greed last year, the owner of the land the shops stand on put rent up almost double and forced the little family businesses out. Clinton Cards bought the book shop lease and turned it into a faceless hole much like "Fox Books" in a certain film...

I love old book shops. They should be protected. They are slowly dying out because of stupid councils and idiotic developers.

Anyway - I had a quick look around the bookshop for something to read but (as per normal) found nothing inspiring so left.

Next stop on my non-shopping adventure was Lakes, a small electical shop where there is a sale going on at the moment. I tried to go look at the walkmans and stuff but the shop was stuffed with old gits dithering over old stock being cleared.

Final stop was at Computer Cavern - Marlow's only independant computer shop. I recalled that they had retro computer games locked away in one of their counters, and thought I'd check them out. I walked in, saw that they were trying to sell several PS2 games at full price (even though they are ancient), and walked back out again.

So. Here I am. It's Saturday afternoon and I have had a non-day.

Somebody please send me an e-mail letting me know that interesting things do actually happen in the world...

I had an early start today to go and visit a client on-site. I left the house at about 7:35 to catch the early train. The journey there was as uneventful as ever (from Marlow to Hillingdon).

As per usual I got the most talkative taxi driver in the world (well, my part of the world) for the journey there. I know it's horrible, but keeping up the conversation was really difficult - he wasn't the sharpest tool in the box by any means.

Arriving on-site I made my way over to the server room and got stuck in to the work for the day - accompanied by Jean Michel Jarre via MP3 files on my laptop (and yes, I do own all the albums, so I am a legal user of MP3s). It was something of a race against time because it turned out that the programming I had been scheduled to prepare over two days off-site needed to really be done on-site, so here I was trying to fit two days worth of coding into one.

I did it 

The one slightly interesting thing that happened away from the snore inducing world of computers for today was one of the chaps that I requested some assistance from nearly having a fight !

The carpark to the place I was visiting is very small, and obviously the few parking spaces available are assigned to company directors and the like. By about lunchtime I needed some help from one of the directors, so gave him a call. He had just arrived back at the office, and came to see me. We walked across the site together, where I saw that the car garage next door had parked a new 44 in his space while moving vehicles around. He had in turn had a fit of temper and parked his car about one inch behind it...

As we walked across the car park (names substituted here), the car garage owner tried to stand in Noddy's way to ask him to remove his car... Noddy meanwhile refused to look him in the face or answer questions, and walked around him. The manager guy tried to sidestep, saying "Come on Noddy, you're blocking the whole car park up!", at which Noddy said "No. I'm not moving it. You move that other car that's in my space. I've told you before a thousand times."

If I had been the manager guy I would have been sorely tempted to belt Noddy one. As we walked into the office, the manager shouted "Noddy...." at which he shouted back "Busy..." and walked straight through the door.

Should it surprise anybody that the Noddy character had a black eye?

Anyway - I've gone on for far too long about a pointless little spat I saw today. It would have been good if there had been a fight though

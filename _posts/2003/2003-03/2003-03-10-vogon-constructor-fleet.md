We've just been messing around in the office (trying not to do any work) and I came up with the following rather stupid sketch...

If you are sad enough to be a fan of "Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy", you might see the funny side of comparing the US Air Force to a Vogon Constructor fleet... picture the scene...

US Warplanes appear flying over Bagdad...

"This is the United States Air Force speaking. Bagdad is going to be destroyed in 6 minutes to make way for a new country which we will help form and re-sell our arms to in order to repeat this destruction in 20 years time. Warnings have been circulated in the national news services of every country for the last 10 years so you have no excuse. Bombing will commence in 5 minutes 32 seconds. Thankyou...."

(closely followed by the southern sounds of Dubbya drifting through the halls of the white-house as he loads up the real time role-playing-game on his PS2 called 'United States President' - "Lock and Load...." )

Then later in the day, Dubbya is surveying the results of his work in front of the huge screens at Norad...

Dubbya : "Damn it boys, your version of my game has much better Graphics than mine - why the hell is that? Why don't I have it?!"

NORAD staffer : "Ummm... Sir... those are live feeds from the geo-stationary satellite."

The staffer then realises that Dubbya doesn't have a clue what he's talking about...

NORAD staffer : "This is a newer version of the game Sir."

Dubbya : "Can I get it for my PS2 too?"

NORAD staffer : "I'm afraid not sir"

Dubbya : "Shit... you even have bigger TVs too... can I have a go next?"

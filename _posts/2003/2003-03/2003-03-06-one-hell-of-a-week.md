This week has been like walking in treacle... whatever that might feel like!?

On Monday I was 30 years old. We went to London for the day because I have always wanted to visit the British Museum. It was a fantastic day out - first stop in the morning was the Tate Modern (gallery), which we got to via the new "Millenium Bridge". Do I have to admit to being really sad and thinking it's design was brilliant?

Next stop (at lunchtime) was the British Museum. As I said - I've always wanted to visit it, but the chance had never really cropped up. We walked in and immediately headed for the restaurant for something to eat (and the food was great), then shot off to look at the amazing things they have there.

Three hours later (and after seeing relics of Egypt, Turkey, Iraq, Greece and Rome, I came to the conclusion that while the relics are amazing, the entire building amounts to nothing more than a collection of stuff "Great Britain" has managed to get away with nicking from the rest of the world.

The picture formed in my head of our ancestors arriving in Greece at some point in the 1700's, spotting the magnificent Parthenon, stripped it, then left, leaving behind something that looked like a badly built Ikea unit...

We left London at about half five, hoping to arrive home in time to meet W's Mum and Dad in town for a pub meal.

Little did I know that for months (since before Christmas) my wife had been organising a surprise birthday party for me... I walked back into the house with W's Mum and Dad with their coats on ready to go out, and BANG - on went the lights and the party poppers... 50 people jump out from the various rooms of the house....

Needless to say an amazing time was had by all, and I can never repay my wonder wife  Apparently she had been stressing out for days about the final planning (along with a few of our friends).

I of course had no idea at all. I must be the most innocent, gullible pillock in the world.

The rest of the week has been a complete drag, but that's another story.

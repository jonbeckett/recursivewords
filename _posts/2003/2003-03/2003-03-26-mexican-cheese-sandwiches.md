We now have only two days before we go on holiday, and I'm really looking forward to it. We're off to the "Firth of Fourth" in Scotland - we will be staying in a little fishing village called St. Monans. I have never been to Scotland before so it's something of an adventure - and I've made a mental promise to myself not to take any kind of computer equipment with me.

This holiday is going to be all about having a "real" break. The biggest decisions at the moment are what music to put in the car for the journey, and which books to take with me to read while we're there.

We've hired a small cottage in the village - our main reconciliation towards normal life was that we shouldn't be either too far from a pub, or too far from a grocery shop - they had to be at least in walking distance (couple of miles maximum).

Sometimes you just need to break away from the normal routine and find yourselves again, don't you - and myself and W haven't done that for a long time. Not since we went to Wales last year. These breaks are turning into our present to ourselves each year 

Anyway - I have work to get on with so I'll sign off until probably tomorrow, by which time the ironing and packing will be in full swing.

Scotland here we come!

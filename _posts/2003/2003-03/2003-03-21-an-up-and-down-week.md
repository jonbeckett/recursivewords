It's been the kind of week you don't like to have too often. Loads crammed into it, and not really enough time to take stock properly.

This morning a help call came in for a customer, and while looking at their workflow system I discovered a huge bug in it (let's call it an oversight on my part). Therefore the development plans for the day went well and truly out of the window. It's sorted now though, so I am once again "the man" 

It's not 5:30 yet and here I am typing stuff into this... shock horror...

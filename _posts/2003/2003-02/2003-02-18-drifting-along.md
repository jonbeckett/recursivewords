I'm bored and trying to think of what to write.

Let's describe my desk...

On the far left is a bendy lamp, and a cordless BT phone just like everybody else has. It has an answerphone on it too. Next is a CD-ROM and the left hand speaker for the main PC, then a pot plant (which is just about past it's sell-by date). Next is a flat bed scanner, and sat on top of it is Indychick's filofax. She'll be looking for that in the morning.

In front of the scanner (and by my hand) is the O'Reilly "SQL in a Nutshell" book. Down the side of the monitor is another lamp, a webcam, and a weird Alien pen holder thing... oh, and there's a digital clock from ATG. Under the SQL book the Mandrake distro CD-ROMs are hiding.

The Daewoo monitor is next, adorned with sticky notes, and to it's right is a subwoofer and a bottle of shower gel, a block of sticky notes, and a calculator. Then there is a desk tidy (overflowing with junk), another speaker, and the monitor, keyboard and mouse for the Linux server.

In front of the keyboard for the Linux server is Indychick's British Census CD-ROM folder, and a pile of mouse-mats from where I work...and an orange hilighter pen.

Wow, isn't this exciting... what on earth did I do today?

Today has been a "drifty" kind of day. I took a Linux book into work with me to crack something I've been picking at for days (sendmail), and ended up spending most of the day piddling about with Word and Excel on a number of quotes and estimates for upcoming projects.

I will admit to having a quick game of "Speedball 2" on the gameboy advance at lunchtime, but these things are allowed, aren't they? 

Last night I had my first real go at WRC2 Extreme on the PS2 - and found out that it's all rather easy - well, either that or I have some kind of innate ability with racing car games. I somehow have managed to win the Monaco and Sweden rallies without every playing the game before... I won monaco on the last stage of the last day by a few seconds, and walked away with Sweden after being half a minute faster on the first stage than anybody else... go figure.

Tonight W is busy playing "Shisenso" or something on the laptop (running Linux remember), and I'm busy pratting about not achieving much at all.

Is my life becoming boring or what?

For those that are intested in the banal tripe I put in this blog, tonight I had pasty, beans and chips for tea. Amazing stuff. Exciting. Riveting.

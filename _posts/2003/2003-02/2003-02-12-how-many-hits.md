Since opening the source code for this noddy little bunch of scripts last night, I've been somewhat taken aback by the number of apparent visitors into the page.

I had no idea hotscripts was such a popular site - that so many people checked it out every day (or perhaps I was lucky?). It reminds me of when cool site of the day listed ThoughtCafe a couple of years ago - 3000 hits overnight.

Today was a bit of a nightmare actually - trying to reply to questions about this while also getting on with my normal work. A couple of the other developers in the office took a look and pointed out some shortcomings that I knew were there but hadn't bothered to code properly yet 

I guess by the end of tonight the Blog scripts are going to be pretty solid if I pick at them. What's really needed I suppose is some good documentation and version control from this point forwards...

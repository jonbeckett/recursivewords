It's valentines day and I was planning on leaving an hour early to pop into town and pick up some flowers and ingredients for tea... except my project manager has just veto'd that. How "jobsworth" is that? I suppose I should resist having a complete rant in case the offending idiot reads this.

One lousy hour... and after all the times I've stayed late to do things. The official reason is that we need to ensure help desk cover. Crap isn't it.

Therefore I have to either leave here at lunchtime, buy everything, bring it back to work and then take it home again, or race home and buy the last crappy flowers in the shop...

I should shut up before I really start...

I finally did it - I opened up the Blog script to the community.

This morning (while I'm supposed to be working on commercial stuff) I had a crisis of conscience, and re-wrote a lot of the PHP behind BLOG to ummm... urrr... make it a bit more professional and stable.

Some of the code to do with having no entries has not been tested, but I'm sure people will tell me if there's anything wrong.

It's strange to put a script out as "Open Source" - a new experience for me. I'm so used to working in the commercial "closed source" world.

I suppose the next thing to add to the blog system will be a calendar with dates hilighted that have entries...

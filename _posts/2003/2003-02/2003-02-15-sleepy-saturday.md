Woohoo! I cooked dinner last night and it was great (I didn't poison indychick!!). We had Chilli, made with Quorn mince (veggie substitute - Indychick doesn't eat meat), kidney beans, tomato puree, chopped tomatoes, onion, peppers and garlic. I got the amount of "Lazy Chillies" just about right... kind of a kick to it but not enough to burn your mouth out  It tasted amazing and I couldn't quite believe I cooked it.

This morning I am in some kind of weird "awake but asleep" mode. It's nearly 11:30 and I'm still sat here at the computer wondering what I'm going to spend Saturday doing. I'd love to get Sendmail working on the Linux computer, but don't really want to prat around with it until I have an ADSL router for the network (yes, I am sad and have a network at home).

I was reading about Mandrake (the Linux distro people) on the web yesterday lunchtime - appears they are in quite a bit of trouble with finances. It's making me wonder if I should start looking around at other distro's... I guess that could be my mission for the day. Redhat is a bit too corporate and boring for me, so it will probably be a weird one.

Aaaannnyyyway - I can feel the coffee pot calling me

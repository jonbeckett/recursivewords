I just spent most of the evening adding a calendar feature to the script.

It has meant the script is now nowhere near as simple as it once was - because a multitude of options have to be catered for according to what the user has clicked on.

Hopefully the code still makes sense though, and the BLOG homepage has the ZIP file with the changes in it for download.

The calendar itself was quite interesting to code - I've never done one before and it turned out to be a lot easier than I expected.

Enjoy, and feel free to leave any comments here!

It's getting near the end of the first day of the week (and as the HR department helpfully pointed out, a fifth of the way towards the weekend).

I just seem to be drifting along at the moment, not really having any interest in computers, the net or anything really. It must be the natural reaction from having spent every waking minute with them over the last few days... setting up Linux servers can be brain draining at the best of times.

I have so many things to learn - it all seems to be such an up-hill battle too. I've been putting books on my wishlist at Amazon, but they are so expensive. There are so many of them too - SendMail, Samba, Apache, SMB, HTTP, Bind, Regular Expressions... the list goes on. I know a fair amount about each of them, but have so many questions still to answer before I'll really be confident in doing things with them.

Ah well. Can't conquer Rome in a day as they say. At least I've figured out Apache, MySQL, and PHP. They turned out to be the easy side of the setup though...

I'm too tired to type this. Enough!

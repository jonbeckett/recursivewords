Today was one of those days that started out quite quietly and got faster as the day went on.

It all started with a big problem getting out of bed this morning. I swear that some little demon or other had removed all will to get up from my brain a few moments before I woke up. For some reason I recall having a really good dream too, but it escapes me what on earth it was about... can't have been that exciting then.

Work started quietly too - starting the programming on a new project. Things rapidly twirled out of control however (as they usually do) when a help call came in - and then another help call came in on top of that.

The rest of the day was spent trying to explain to my project manager a problem with the system HE wrote the technical specification for, so really he SHOULD have understood what was going on. I ended up writing him the text for HIS email to the client... go figure.

I really am starting to wonder if the office I work in really is the one from the dilbert comic strip. At times the likeness is scarey.

Later in the afternoon the second help call turned into a change request which I probably have to implement next week... but of course in between I spotted an email from my project manager to the client telling them I'll be visiting on Friday to install some changes to their system - surely he knows I haven't coded the changes yet? Surely he realises he hasn't told me to do it yet? I'll leave it until mid morning tomorrow to ask him 

Aaannnyyyway - I just finished fixing some bugs on ThoughtCafe, and am thinking about going to bed now. Tonight has been a pretty quiet night of telly watching and pratting around on the net. Ho hum. What a boring life I'm leading at the moment (I believe I've said that this week already).

I do hope all you people out there in internet land have better things to be doing that reading this.

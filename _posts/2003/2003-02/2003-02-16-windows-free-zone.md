Woohoo!

All the computers in the house are now running Linux... goodbye to crappy old Windows. To be honest, I have been running Windows for a few years at home (and still have to at work), but have been patiently waiting for the day when Linux would be useable as a desktop operating system (I'm talking about Utility here).

I've been playing with recent distro's at work for a while, and they have been pretty good, which has led to me now running a Linux partition on each and every machine in the house - the Linux server of course knows nothing else, but then it only has WindowMaker on it, along with Apache, MySQL, PHP and Samba...

I must sound like I'm burbling. It's very late I suppose, and I'm just pleased to have got the main machine with the internet connection to connect through Linux. I thought I was going to have problems, but evidently it's all working out of the box 

Hoorah! I say.

What else happened today? I bought the new WRC Rally game for the PS2 (well, it's not new any more, but I tend to read all the reviews these days before buying a game). I had a quick go on it earlier, but I expect I'll wait until the week to try it properly.

Tomorrow we're out at W's Mum's and my Brother's, so it's going to be a busy Sunday... christ - it's gone 1am... I must be mad.

I'm sat at my desk this afternoon after being in and out of the office for the last few days, and I don't really know what to do next...

It turns out, after a mad scramble to get several of the projects out of the way that I am now effectively free from any specific work until late March... figure that one out.

I have to admit that when I first found out my mind immediately jumped towards making my own workflow or document management system. The reasoning behind this goes back to the last few projects I've worked on - when we wanted a particular level of functionality, but to do it we had to have complete overkill.

It's tempting to start work on a workflow solution in the same way that it's tempting to work on a chess engine - it's a deceptively simple piece of programming that becomes incredibly complex under certain situations.

Aaannyyyway - Darth Vader just turned up at my desk with the CD of a new version of some software to try out. I can't see it being a problem, but you never know...

I'm bored. I'm tired. I want to go home.

Today I am at work and I'm not really sure why. I feel like crap (I did all weekend), and can't really concentrate properly.

I had Friday off work and sat at home wondering what to do with myself, but not having any energy to get up and do anything. It's the first time I've had a virus in ages actually (he says looking for some wood to touch).

The whole of Saturday and then Sunday morning was pretty much taken up with tidying the house up (i.e. go to the tip or jam stuff in the loft), then last night I attempted to get the Linux server up and running properly.

I'm trying to make one machine connect to the internet, as well as act as a router for the network at home, and perform DNS, DB and File serving functions. It's kind of getting there, but for some reason it just won't connect to the net - I think it's because I've arsed the connection sharing up (I tried out the mandrake wizard).

Ah well. I'll take it apart tonight and see where I get with it doing things manually.

Indychick's out tonight at her reading group, so I get the whole evening to basically kick my heals and do what I like. Normally this would be a chance to buy lots of Pizza an beer, but I'm kind of Pizza'd out at the moment. Perhaps I'll pop in somewhere on the way home to get something to eat.

Anyway - work goes on in the office - I'm preparing a virtual machine to do a change request on somebody's system. It's taking ages because the machine needs Win2K Pro, SQL 2K, E-Work and FileNET Panagon installed... kind of a rebooters dream 

Later...

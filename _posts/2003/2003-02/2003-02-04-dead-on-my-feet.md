After pulling a late nighter working on my website last night, finally getting to bed at about 2:30, the tiredness has really hit me this afternoon.

It's like somebody has suddenly hung very heavy things off my eyelids or something.

The ThoughtCafe website appears to be doing quite well (shocking!). I sent the newsletter out last night - the cause of the late night. It went to just over 2000 people. I had to switch off Norton Antivirus because it blew up while recieving the piles of outgoing emails.

Actually, I was a bit annoyed last night - I was planning on doing the newsletter in Adobe Acrobat format (printing from PagePlus). It decided (like Windows programs do) to blow to pieces every time I tried to print to Acrobat. Finally at about 1am I gave up and did the newsletter in HTML format.

The temptation to run around on the green outside the house shouting obscenities about Microsoft was sorely tempting.

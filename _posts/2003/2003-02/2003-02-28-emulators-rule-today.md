Last night I installed ZSNES and KEGA on the laptop at home (along with several hundred ROM images downloaded from alt.binaries). Oh what fun I had... well, I did once I got the USB gamepad working with the damn thing.

Guess who didn't read the instructions, and pluggedout the gamepad in before installing the drivers for it? Hahahaaaa - and then guess who had to remove it all and start again 

When I did get it working the next conundrum was setting the button layout up to match that of the consoles mentioned - which would have been a lot easier if I could have been bothered to get off my backside and go fetch one of the real controllers from the other room.

In the end I got it working, and played a couple of levels of Super Mario World, and was quite amazed at how close the emulation is to the original machine - the same goes for Sonic 3 on KEGA.

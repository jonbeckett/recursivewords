We have travelled down to visit my parents in Cornwall for the weekend, and are having a very lazy Sunday indeed. I think being away from home kind of forces you into a different pattern - because you physically can't go off tinkering with something that needs to be done, you relax that little bit more.

We arrived late on Friday night (after leaving straight from work), and spent yesterday wandering around the local area.

In the morning we walked the mile or so down to Talland Bay. It's quite strange to go down there now - after spending so many years messing around on the beach during holidays there are a child. Walking around the beach reminds me of different scenes that happened at different parts of the beach - like Toby (our Golden Retriever when I was a lad) digging enormous holes and begging people for their ice creams...

On the way down to the beach, indychick had seen lots of sloes and blackberrys in the hedgerow, and of course spotted that the cafe at the beach sold plastic buckets... in true five year old fashion she exclaimed "THEY SELL BUCKETS!" (with an intake of breath)... and I said - "well, you've got money - if you want a bucket, you go and buy one"... "oh, go on.. pleeeaaasseee","Nope"... two minutes later I had of course bought the bucket and off we went.

Anybody that passed us on the hill over the next hour would have laughed out loud. W was perched on top of my shoulders (rather unsteadily), bucket in hand, expertly stripping the entire hedgerow of blackberrys. I was banned from picking them because I kept eating them. My only defence is that they were really nice 

In the afternoon we went into Looe shopping and took my Mum. Big mistake. We went in a second hand bookshop to have a look around, and Mum said she was going in a jewellers. We had a quick look around the books, then went to find her... an hour later we finally found her after searching all the way around Looe twice. "Where have you been?" she started...

Anyway... last night we went to "The Old Ferry Inn" in Bodinnick (across the river from Fowey) for a meal. I didn't see any of the faces I remember in the Pub from years before, but a good time was had by all and we finished the night uncomfotably full after eating far too much 

Today is Sunday, and we are being lazy. I'm sat at my Dad's computer at 11:05 in the morning after doing very little indeed all morning so far. Mum made me breakfast - isn't it great being fussed over when you visit your parents 

We have to go to Looe later to pick up a box of Pasties, but apart from that we have absolutely no plans for the rest of the day. I wonder what we'll end up doing?

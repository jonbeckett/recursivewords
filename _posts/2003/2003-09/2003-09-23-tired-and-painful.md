This morning I got out of the shower, got dressed and was busy wandering around the house finding stuff for work (as you do), when suddenly my neck stiffened up. I have no idea why.

I thought it would go away after a minute or two, but it's now three hours later and my neck still hurts like hell. It's kind of a muscle at the back of my neck that hurts, and it's really annoying the hell out of me.

Thankfully I have a swivel chair at work so can sit here like a Dalek and yell at everybody to stop laughing at me.

In a moment I may attempt walking down to the kitchen to make a coffee - that will be a pain filled adventure I'm sure.

Today at work I am the only person on helpdesk. Usually there are four or five of us to choose from when a call comes in, but through various reasons I'm alone. Bang went any hope of finishing the development for a job we're installing on Thursday...

Changing subject, the other evening I was sat on the couch messing around on my laptop when my wife came bouncing in and sat down next to me to see what I was up to. I was halfway through explaining about C++ dereferenced pointers when I realised just how sad I was and started laughing... yes, I was spending the evening playing around with low level computer code... yes, I am interested in that kind of thing as a hobby... yes, I am a nerd.

Ah well. Guess I should go make that coffee.

It's 11am on Saturday morning and I'm looking forward to a relaxing weekend. Last night indychick had a "Body Shop" party, with a few friends round, so myself, my brother, and a mate from work drank, ate pizza, and played computer games all night.

I think the most fun of the night was probably had playing "Burnout 2" on the PS2 - my little nephew laughed so much he couldn't speak...

Anyway... it's Saturday!

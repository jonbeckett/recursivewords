We fly to the US on Saturday morning from London Heathrow - only today and tomorrow to survive at work before 2 weeks away from all the hassle...

Today I am working on a change request and some fixes for an established system, and tomorrow I should hopefully be working on a huge chunk of code cryptically called "The Parser" that I wrote a couple of years ago. I need to add a bit more functionality to it in order to expand what it's capable of doing... I might even get to it this afternoon if all goes well with other fixes.

Actually, correct that - I just spent the first hour of the day fighting fires with testing of the code I wrote yesterday (and was quite happy with).

I suppose I'm just going to have to see how it goes today.

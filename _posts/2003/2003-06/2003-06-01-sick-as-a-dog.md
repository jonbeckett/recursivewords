We went out to a housewarming party on Friday night. I didn't know if I should go or not, because I had been going downhill all the way through Friday at work, and was coughing more or less every few minutes.

We decided to go in the end, and had a great time (actually, my other half had a bit too much of a great time and I had to carry her half the way home, but that's a whole other story). Did I know about it the next day though...

The cough I had started with on Friday had now turned into a wickedly bad cough, which was making me feel sick, and giving me an enormous headache. It went on and on too (as I type this on Sunday night I still feel like crap).

Just to make matters worse the thought of going to work in this state isn't really cheering me up, but I can't really afford to be off during this coming week - there is so much going on I'll really land myself in it.

Anyway. Enough bleeting on about myself. This is the first entry for June 2003, and I guess I should remark about the weather here in the UK. Yesterday afternoon it was so hot I was doing the washing up (in just my shorts), and was sweating just standing there...

We are going to America!

We fly out on the 21st June for San Francisco, to stay with relatives in San Rafael for 2 weeks. To say we are looking forward to it is something of an understatement.

To be honest I never thought I would be allowed the time off, but I asked anyway and was amazed when it was cleared immediately - indychick was amazed too when the company she has been temping for not only let her go, but ended her contract too...

When she got home I asked if she was happy or sad about her time at the company coming to an end (it's been 18 months now), and she didn't know - but was looking forward to going somewhere different when we return. She had been pushed from management accounting to normal monthly accounts which she hates doing.

I guess I'm just looking forward to time away. I can't say my job has been the most interesting in the world over the last couple of years. The company I work for has ended up having to fight for every penny - meaning anybody with any experience has to juggle all their skills and perhaps not be doing what they would like to be doing. I know I'm not.

Things are looking up though - I'll shortly be starting development on a website for somebody so that will at least fill my mind. Experience seems to breed cynicism in the web/software development world though - I won't go counting any chickens until things start to happen.

What a boringly corporate sounding diary entry...

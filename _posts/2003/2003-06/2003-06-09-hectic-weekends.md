We got up early on Saturday to get into London (I had to get a new passport).

Actually - I haven't said anything about the reason for the new passport, have I. We were so fed up and tired last weekend we decided to go on holiday. After at least 30 seconds of deliberation we decided that we're off to San Francisco to see family.

The most amazing thing was discovering that both my work and my wife's work approved the holiday! By the end of Tuesday we had everything in place to go, and by Wednesday the tickets were booked. The only thing that remained was for me to renew my passport, which meant a trip to the passport office in Victoria on saturday morning.

So... I now have a shiny new passport (with a photo taken in the photo booth at Paddington station), and some new shoes too! (we went in the Brantano shoe store on the way home from London).

Ummm... this is meandering all over the place, isn't it. While in London we had 4 hours to wait for the passport, so had a walk through Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens (via Peter Pan) to the museums - and spent most of the day either in the Science Museum or the Natural History Museum.

I was a bit shocked at the rubbish Moon Lander in the Science Museum - I could probably do better with ten packs of tin foil and some grocery boxes.

Hilight of the day was probably going back to the Natural History Museum for the first time in 20 years and finding that the Diplodocus had shrunk. When I was a kid that thing was HUGE - and now it's about 10 feet tall...

Ah well... better get on with some work I suppose.

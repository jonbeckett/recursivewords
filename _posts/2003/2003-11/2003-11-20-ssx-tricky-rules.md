I have spent the last few evenings taking it in turns with indychick to play SSX Tricky on the PS2. I had never bought an extreme sport game before, and only really bought this one because indychick hasn't been well and I thought it would cheer her up a bit. What an amazing game it is!!

For those that have no idea, SSX Tricky is a snowboarding game. You get to 'play' one of a number of characters who take part in various snowboarding events - things like racing down huge hill courses (through forests, rock formations, and even snow filled city streets), doing "showoff" runs for points, or straightforward "free runs" where you get to prat around.

I have to admit that we have both become addicted to it. I have never known a game cause so many flash fits of temper (from me) when I have been beaten by it. It's got the worst "one more go" factor of any game I've ever played 

Aside from messing around with the PS2, I have been at something of a loss over the last few weeks for something to do with myself. Now the ThoughtCafe website is essentially being wound down, I have to keep resisting the urge to start another web project - I have promised that I will take part in the web for a change rather than run some of it 

I guess that's why I'm playing chess again. I seem to play chess in the winter anyway

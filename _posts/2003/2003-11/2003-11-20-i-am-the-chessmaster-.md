I am a little enthused at the moment.

I just won a game of chess on Yahoo! Chess (go visit games.yahoo.com to try it out). I was playing this git who did an opening book trick to take a piece off me at the start of the game. I thought "right then you bastard - let's see how good you are..." - I checkmated him by the 23rd move 

Here's the score of the game for those that are remotely interested:

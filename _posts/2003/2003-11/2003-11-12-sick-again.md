I came home from work at lunchtime today - indychick is off work too; we both have pretty bad colds. When I got in she was quite shocked - apparently I have dark lines under my eyes.

When I got up this morning I really didn't want to go into work, but felt I had to because of the change request I've been working on for one of our clients. Software development seems to be one of those jobs where you retreat inside yourself so much when you are really absorbed in what you are doing that you don't notice so much if there is anything wrong with you.

This morning was like that - even though I felt dreadful when I arrived at work, once I was sat down and working I forgot all about feeling bad - except of course when I finished and sat back I felt even worse  Last night was like that too - even though I tried to block work out of my head, I found myself wandering about it... then I woke up in the early hours of this morning and it was still there, picking away at the back of my mind.

Anyway - I'm sat here in the front room at home with the laptop, it's sunny but cold outside, and I'm wondering what to do to this blog script next. It would be really tempting to develop the template system that I've been promising for so long (that would essentially move the whole thing towards version 2), but it's a huge undertaking and I just don't feel well enought to even make a start.

Hey - while surfing around on the web just now I checked out Nik Kershaw's website. Apparently he's pulling out of the music recording business again - mainly because people keep trying to book him for 80's tribute concerts rather than for his current music.... like the man says himself - even he's not that desperate

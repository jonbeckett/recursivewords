I have stayed off work today after losing the battle with an ear infection. I thought about going in at lunchtime, and started to get ready - but bent down to do my shoes up and nearly fell over... so cycling to work (I ride a mountain bike in) wouldn't have been the safest thing in the world to do.

I've had my balance affected before, and know if I have a bath tonight and keep taking the nurofen, by tomorrow it should be much better. I know my balance won't be exactly brilliant for a few days though.

It kind of makes you feel like a fraud though - there appears to be nothing outwardly wrong with you - until you bend over, and look like you've had a skinfull...

To while away the time today I have been working on some programming that we've been looking at in the office, and on my blog script. I'm still a bit stumped on the decision of going to templates or not - it will mean a huge overhead on the programming to pull bits and pieces in and re-tool them to suit. It's not a huge problem to make people change the PHP scripts though - and the new version in much easier to change than it was previously.

Oh - I pulled out of the Nanowrimo thing. I decided that I would rather have a break from "commitments" on the internet. Taking part in nanowrimo was a bit stupid really - just at the time I was letting go of ThoughtCafe, I nearly got involved in another huge project. At least I didn't start, so it's not like something I didn't finish.

Oh well. I guess if I pull the stops out and package this script up nicely, I can pretty safely make it available for download. It probably needs a fair bit of documentation though.

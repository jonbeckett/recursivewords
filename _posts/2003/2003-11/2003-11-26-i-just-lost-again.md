I just setup an account on ICC (Internet Chess Club) and subjected myself to a number of wipeouts playing chess... admittedly I was only playing 5 or 6 minute games, but my chess playing abilities seem to be far less than they were five or so years ago when I used to play regularly.

I'm not really sure why I'm so crap either - I just seem to be missing obvious combinations and leaving pieces hanging all the time...

Oh well. It won't stop me playing, but I just know it's going to take me a while to get into playing well again. Perhaps I should forget about playing speed chess for a while and just play the computer. The other day I bought Chess Tiger for my palm, so I can play that when I'm waiting for my computer at work to compile or rar a vm...

I keep looking at the basic layout of this blog system and thinking about doing a new template... something Manga themed maybe.

I guess I should go have a look at other blog systems and see how they have decorated them.

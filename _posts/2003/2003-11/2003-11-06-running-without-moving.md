As you will have noticed if you have visited via the "blog" URL, I am in the process of re-writing the Blog script, and have now ditched the old version. Over the next few days I will be adding tons more functionality to it and getting closer to a release version.

Part of the job of releasing software for other people to use includes documenting all the source code properly - unfortunately I have not had time to do that yet, but hopefully tonight should see that put right.

Today at work things are going okayish. I have been working on an integration project for one of our clients that will (eventually) fit into their workflow system.

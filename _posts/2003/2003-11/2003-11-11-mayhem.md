I think today will go down in my memory as one of those days you would prefer you hadn't had.

I got up this morning with a pretty bad cold (which I've still got), and went into work basically because they are short handed and can't afford to be without me.

Anyway - for the last week I have been working on a change request for the workflow at one of our more important clients. This workflow currently has many thousands of "items" floating around, being handled by well over a hundred staff...

To cut a long story short, in the middle of the afternoon, after placing the various pieces of the jigsaw I had developed into place, I made a slight mistake with one of the pieces - meaning that the entire contents of the main workflow stage started travelling across the workflow and back.

Luckily I realised what was happening before I did anything too dangerous, and just let it get on with it - but when you think in terms of how many people are relying on the code you are writing, it doesn't bare thinking about.

Tonight on the way home I couldn't get my mind off it, and even now (after spending this evening working on the Blog script) I still find my myself wandering off to think about the various pieces of wreckage that need fixing tomorrow.

For what it's worth, there is a new version of the Blog script available for download now - I went through and documented a lot of the code tonight, and replaced the session variables I had been using to avoid some errors with other clients.

Perhaps now will be a good time to stop typing and go take part in real life for an hour before another day of mayhem starts...

I was just reading somebody elses blog, and the term "meme" came up yet again - I keep seeing this term all over the place, so decided to look it up.

Here's what I found in Wikipedia;

The term "meme" ([mi?m] in the IPA; rhymes with "dream"), derived from the Greek word mimema, "something imitated" often refers to a piece of information passed from one mind to another.

So there you go. A meme is a piece of information passed from one mind to another. So it is the correct term to describe the twenty-question style blurts that people post up on their blogs. Hmmm - "blurts" - now that's not going to be in wikipedia, is it. I think I may have just made that one up.

It's the American influence. It must be. The requirement to make a word up rather than re-construct a sentence to use more appropriate words. "Buglarize" - that's my favourite.

After a cursory search on the internet (not being able to come up with a meme myself), I came across The Memes List website, and have the pleasure of presenting a meme below;

List ten things that are worth their weight in gold.

In no particular order...

 1.  Duh... "Gold" of course.              2.  My other half              3.  My "real world" friends              4.  My internet friends              5.  Chocolate              6.  Chocolate Ice Cream              7.  Our cat "Simpson"              8.  Yahoo Messenger (I'm "jonbeckett73" by the way)              9.  Skype (I'm "jonbeckett73" by the way)              10. Digital Cameras            

It may interest you to know that I was instructed to write our cat in the list after consulting my other half (I really did get no further than Chocolate Ice Cream). In reality, our cat probably weighs more than an equivalent volume of gold.

Actually, once I got going (after the stall at Ice Cream), the last few came to mind relatively quickly. I love keeping in touch with friends - both real and online - and reading blogs, so deciding on what elements of that existence to list was a bit of a challenge.

So there you go... "Memes".

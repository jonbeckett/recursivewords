Where to start? The photo I guess... it was taken a couple of weeks ago in Higginson park - about 15 minutes walk from our house in the middle of Marlow. I was out playing with the new camera.

I just got back from town after going on a "goody buying mission" to cheer up W. We had a phonecall this morning from the IVF clinic - they had forgotten to take blood tests yesterday lunchtime when we went to visit, so we had to go straight back this morning and W got jabbed yet again. Visits to the clinic seem to be every day at the moment - we have another appointment tomorrow morning too.

In town I had one thing to get for the house (a calendar), but the rest of it was really "cheer up W" stuff. I ended up getting her a new fountain pen - that she has needed for ages, and a new diary. Oh - and a jigsaw, and two Playstation games. I keep telling people that it's not me who plays games, but they never believe me.

Next stop was the supermarket to get something nice to eat. Malted loaf - check. Brie - check. Leerdammer - check. Chocolate - check. Smoothie - check.

So I'm finally back, we've eaten, and it's already nearly 3pm. There went Saturday I guess.

Plans for this evening are probably to do as little as possible and try to have a bit of our weekend to ourselves for a change. Who knows - it might even happen.

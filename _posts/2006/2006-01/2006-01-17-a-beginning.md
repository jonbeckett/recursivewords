All blogs have to start somewhere, and this is the start of this one.

I have previously written blogs with wordpress, Yahoo 360, my own blog script, and even blogger. The reason for coming back is because I really can't be bothered with setting up and configuring something new yet again.

I just want somewhere free, that works, to expound my daily thoughts to whoever might be listening at the time. I usually write every day, so if you like reading blogs too, please add the feed URL to your browser too (the little orange icon at the foot of the right hand margin).

Today started at 7:30am when the radio alarm woke me up. I turned to W and reminded her that I had left my bike at work last night, and that she had promised to give me a lift in... the grunt that followed indicated that she had forgotten all about that.

W is off work for the next three weeks while we go through a cycle of IVF, and is being pumped with a cocktail of drugs each night (by me, because she faints at the sight of blood). The drugs have made her extremely tired most of the time, which kind of explained her reaction to knowing she would have to get up.

I did my usual motley fool act while getting ready for work and managed to cheer her up sufficiently to make the journey to where I work bearable. It's only a few miles, but I still felt guilty dragging her out of bed.

Some of our friends are a little taken aback that we are so open with the fact that we're doing IVF. We took the decision when we first found out that there was no point being secretive about any of it - hell, we even went on national television when we first found out (there was a special show one morning about IVF). It got us a free consultation at a specialist hospital where they found out we really did have a problem.

The interesting thing is that we've discovered a lot of the people we know have had trouble conceiving too - and they all live very similar lives to us. They have professional jobs, relatively stressful jobs, and little spare time. There's too many of them to say it's just a coincidence too.

Anyway... I went off on a wild tangent there.

Today at work I was supposed to be working on support (we take it in turns doing a few days each), but ended up in a series of meetings. In a way I was grateful because support is the most deadly dull role in the organisation, and meetings do have a habit of eating hours out of the day.

Following a rather dull day I now find myself sat at home and writing this entry into my "new" blog. I'm sure as the days go by I'll find more exciting things to talk about. I have all kinds of bizarre interests (most of them considered geeky by most people) so will no doubt cause the greatest incidence of sleeping sickness ever - depending on the size of my audience.

Sounds like dinner is ready... I better go.

I have just decided that a comic strip will happen.

I have been reading an article (a question and answer session at MIT between the guys at Penny Arcade and the students), and it's made me realise that I have absolutly nothing stopping me from starting an online comic.

The obvious person to base it on is myself - because I know myself rather well. I'm guessing I'll need to involve the cat too, because everybody loves jokes where people are nasty to the cat. And before anybody that loves cats gets angry, the cat will almost always win the day. If I'm ever nasty to our cat at home, he either takes out some evil retribution himself, or I'm caughty by my other half in the act of being nasty and reprimanded appropriately.

What sort of subjects will the comic cover?

Computer games is a given. The internet. Porn on the web. Chat communities. Anything and everything that ever winds me up may well make it's way into the comic.

I'm actually looking forward to starting on it already.

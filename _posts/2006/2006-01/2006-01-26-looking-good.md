Just a quick update (don't have much time at the moment)... we got the lab results back from the Lister Hospital in London this morning - fantastic news - they collected 8 suitable eggs from W, and all of them have fertilized.

It's a huge weight off our mind. Usually with IVF, you hope for 3 or 4 of the eggs to have fertilized. 8 really is unprecedented. It means we will almost certainly have enough to freeze.

We'll have more news in a day or two once the eggs have developed further (sometimes they don't for all sorts of reasons - in the same way that only something like 25% of normal pregnancies succeed - most of the time women don't have a clue they might have been "pregnant" for a few days).

There is a weird thought that struck me this morning though - for the next few days, in a lab in London there are 8 prototypes of myself and W busily growing... that's just weird.

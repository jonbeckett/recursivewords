I wonder if there is a name for the study of conversation subject paths? If you're wondering why I'm thinking that, just read on for a few paragraphs, and you'll either be interested too, or think "yep - he's lost it".

My colleague behind me suddenly exclaimed "I can see a UFO!". I then leaned backwards and looked out the window... he then proclaimed "Made you look!", and much merriment was had by all (it was either laugh, or jam some blunt object up his arse).

From there - somehow - we got onto the subject of "what if you stood in the car park outside with a big amplifier, and a Tuba, and played the notes from 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'?". That led on to maybe using a vocoder to digitize our voices, and warn the entire estate at several thousand decibels that we were a Vogon Contructor Fleet, and that the entire planet was going to be demolished in 6 minutes to make way for an interstallar bypass.

You're starting to get the idea now, aren't you.

We went from that subject - and I have no idea how - to "what if NASA suddenly admitted that space didn't really exist and that they'd made it all up?".

What if NASA really did?

In the image below you can obvisouly see that Clangers were after all real... so how can we trust anything else NASA tells us?

Of course that led onto the various explanations for how the world had really been working all these years... that the world was really flat, and what we think of as the sky was only really a few hundred feet up. When you go on holiday in a 747, all they really do is trundle to the destination across the top of the ceiling, while showing back projected footage of what flying might look like if we could really do it.

We then theorised that the moon landings could well have been staged at the English China Clay pits in Cornwall, and that if you looked carefully at the reflections in Neil and Buzz's space helmets, you could probably see the visitors centre and an ice-cream van in the background.

You can imagine the transmission from the Lunar Lander... "Houston, we have an ice cream".

Do you ever feel guilty about being lazy? It's now just gone 12:00 on Sunday, and all I have managed to do so far is get out of bed at about 10, make a cup of tea, play with the Playstation for a couple of hours (in my housecoat), have a shower, and get dressed.

My day is "officially" starting right now - except of course the morning has already gone.

The admittedly weak reason I was playing on the Playstation was to have a go on it before W got up. I bought her "The Sims 2" yesterday, and she's been glued to it ever since. I also got "Formula One 2005" for myself, and due to much simmage, I haven't been able to play it at all - well, until this morning anyway.

We had our usual call from the hospital in London yesterday morning - all the eggs have carried on dividing, and are all looking good, so we go in tomorrow morning for them to be transferred to W.

We're trying not to get too excited, but it's difficult.

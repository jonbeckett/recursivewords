Over the last few days I have been juggling with the thought of stopping blogging all together - thinking of maybe going back to a paper diary.

Then I thought some more, and remembered something that I realised a while ago (on a sidenote, why is this post starting to sound like something A A Milne might have written?).

I write in my blog primarily for myself. If people read it and are entertained by it, that's fine. Good even. But the main reason I write is to get me through those boring moments of the day, or when I have something on my mind and want to discuss it with the imaginary audience that might or might not be out there listening.

I guess it's similar to the way you might listen to a friend telling you about their troubles - and normally they will find their own resolution while telling you; they just needed to tell somebody. Anybody. With blogging, the "anybody" is an audience that might or might not be there.

Does this mean I have faith that there is an audience out there somewhere? Now there's a good question...

I just did a survey at tickle.com, and am somewhat shocked, stunned and amazed at the result. I filled out a survey to answer the question "What kind of Dog are you?"... here's the response;

No bones about it, you're an energetic, devoted Chihuahua. For your breed, size definitely doesn't matter. After all, sometimes the best things (diamonds, car keys, Godiva truffles) come in small packages. Honest and straightforward, you're never afraid to speak up for what you believe in, especially if it's a cause near and dear to your heart. Having such a passionate personality can come with a few drawbacks, though. You can be moody at times, and people often find it hard to live up to your high standards. But once you make a friend, it's for life. Saucy and intense, your energy and unfailing loyalty make you a great companion. Woof!

What a complete load of crap! Anybody who knows me would say instantly that I am a labrador. It's pretty simple too - I am easily pleased, any act of kindness makes me happy, I do idiotic things when bored, and can be persuaded to do anything for food - particularly chocolate. I'm also a bit of an oaf (translation follows for those who do not know what an oaf is).

Oaf. A person regarded as stupid or clumsy. An awkward stupid person

Does that sound like a chihuahua to you? My arse does it. A chihuahua is one of those annoying little people who bleats on about things, and runs away when you shout at them. Somebody who nags in a whiney manner.

Who could have thought I would get so wound up over a stupid decision made by a computer about who I am...

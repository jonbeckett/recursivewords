Okay... I've been playing with the new camera (at last)

The weather outside has been pretty grotty for the last few weeks - and when it has been good I've not had the time to go out. This evening I thought "what the hell", and climbed up into the loft to fetch my old photography lamp. 500 watts of artificial sunlight. Just the job.

The photos (below) were the first I have taken on fully manual with the new camera. I had to get the book out to figure out the aperture and shutter controls, but from then on I was fine - many moons ago I studied photography at college.

The thing you can do with a fully manual camera, that you just cannot do with an automatic is narrow the depth of field on purpose. It's great fun 

I'm not too happy with this one - there's just something not quite right about it. Maybe the hand should have been the thing in focus? Oh well... at least it didn't cost anything to create it - unlike the (soon to be numbered) days of traditional film photography, where you were loath to experiment because each shot cost X amount to get developed and printed.

I guess I should really go and look at photofriday and see what their project is for the week.

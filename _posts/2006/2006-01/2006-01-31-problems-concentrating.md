I'm back in the office this morning and having real problems concentrating.

Yesterday we went back to the Lister Hospital in London for the egg transfer - effectively the last part of the IVF treatment (where they put the fertilized eggs back into the womb). It's difficult to type this without smiling, but "technically", it means W could quite possibly be pregnant now.

Because they waited for the eggs to become "blastocysts" before putting them back, it raises the odds of conception to above 70%. Here's the scary part - they put two blastocysts back - which means we have over a 50% chance of twins.

Unfortunately W still has to keep taking a cocktail of drugs for the new few weeks - a mixture of steroids, anti-coagulants, and hormone supplements. The worst part is an injection each night of a drug called "Fragmin" that causes bruising. The injection itself doesn't hurt too much, but the contents of it do - it has sodium in it.

For at least the next few weeks - and possibly months - we have to try and keep our feet on the ground now. We know from past experience that "getting pregnant" is only the start of the story, and that all kinds of things can and do go wrong.

Okay. I now promise to return to geeky posts about all kinds of things that are interesting (to me) for the next few weeks. I was talking about this while on the train with W yesterday though - I find pretty much everything interesting.

Thanks for all the comments from people reading this blog by the way - they're really appreciated.

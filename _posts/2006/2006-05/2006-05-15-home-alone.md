Did I write a blog yesterday? I don't recall...

Yesterday morning I woke up and discovered that turning my head caused immense amounts of pain. I don't know what causes it - perhaps sleeping strangely, perhaps cold draughts. I've had it before and I dare say I'll have it again. It's only when you have some kind of affliction like that, that you realise how simple tasks suddenly cause immense pain.

Filling the dishwasher up. Doing shoes up. Looking at the computer screen. All of these stupid tasks caused my neck to hurt. I guess because it meant it has to support my head (yep - that's right - I'll get there with the joke first - my brain is so heavy that I've strained my neck). I don't mean hurt a little bit either - I mean enough to cause a headache and make you stop whatever you're doing.

So - I spent most of yesterday either laying out on the couch, or rubbing ibrufren gel or deep heat into my neck, or wrapping a hot pillow thing that belongs to W around my shoulders. It feels like it's going to burn your skin when you first lay it on, but it seems to work quite well.

Towards the end of yesterday it was really starting to get me down. Imagine doing pretty much anything being painful. I'm not the kind of person that can sit and do nothing either.

This morning I woke up and it was better, but not significantly so - so I've now missed a day of work too. Thankfully it has got better throughout the day (hence me being able to use the computer once more) - but having said that, I'm going to have to stop writing this soon - it's starting to ache from looking down at the screen...

Hopefully another night of sleep and being careful with my pillows will solve this. God it's depressing. My body is coming apart at the seams. I'm starting to wonder what will be next...

(and yes, this is the normally optimistic Jonathan writing this, so you get some idea how p*ssed off I am)

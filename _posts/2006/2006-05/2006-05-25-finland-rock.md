I forgot to mention that last weekend I sat and watched the Eurovision Song Contest, and happily voted for the runaway winner - Lordi, from Finland...

Aren't they just the best? If you live outside of Europe you probably have no idea what the Eurovision Song Contest is. Let me explain... Each year every country in Europe is allowed to put a band forward for the competition, and they end up with a big TV program where the bands play. While all this is going on, the citizens of each country can vote for the countries they like the best.

Unfortunately the "public vote" is only part of the story though - each country also has a panel of judges who's vote counts as much as the public vote. Because of this the whole thing is hilariously corrupt. Bordering countries always vote their neighbours bands as the best...

There was a renegade in the competition this year though - in among the rubbish euro-pop and sickly out of tune ballads, Lordi arrived from Finland. What's this? A Band? and they can play instruments? and they can sing too? And they have axes and swords? Excellent...

They were run away winners. It probably helped that the bible basher contingent tried to stop people voting for them by complaining that they were advocating satanic worship. Here's some news for the religious folks - the only people who worry about "satanic" stuff are other religious people. Your normal person in the street just likes the music... oh, and by the way - I know you won't listen to this, but that Dan Brown book is a f*cking Novel! It didn't really happen!

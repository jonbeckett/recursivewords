After finishing work at 11:30pm last night, and then going in early today, myself and a colleague worked straight through the day (eating at our desks) and finally turned in the prototype project we have been working on to the consultants to show the client tomorrow.

Hurdle over. Life can continue. I would have a story to tell about the whole effort/episode, but am perpetually aware now of my blog being read by people at my workplace. Sorry  I have to admit that I would rather have an open blog than pretend to be nobody. Who wants to be a nobody?

Anyway - here I sit. The beginning of this entry got written two hours ago - since then the shopping arrived, I made dinner, and we are now relaxing for the remains of the evening.

Hopefully some time soon I'll come up with something entertaining to blog about.

I woke up this morning to the gentle tones of our house telephone running out of battery charge - "beep..... beep..... beep", followed by W leaning over and putting it back on the charger. Shortly after that the clock-radio burst into life.

After spending far too long sitting in front of the google box (television) with a cup of redbush tea I decided I really couldn't put off getting ready for work any longer.

This morning "getting ready for work" meant having a shave - and seeing that I had not shaved all weekend, it meant practically shaving a beard off. I hate shaving, and I'm not really sure why. I can see why some men have beards - well, the lazy ones anyway.

So - I managed to have a shower, shave, get dressed and stumbled out of the house (stealing a carton of orange juice from the fridge on the way).

After facing a head-wind all the way to work - the last thing I wanted after yesterday's run - the only thing of note to happen this morning was some idiot nearly taking me off my bike after turning across the front of me without signalling.

So - here I am at work, sat drinking orange juice, and contemplating what I need to get done today.

Check back for more news on my exciting day as it happens. Don't laugh - something exciting might happen. Granted - it hasn't before, but you never know. That's called "optimism", isn't it...

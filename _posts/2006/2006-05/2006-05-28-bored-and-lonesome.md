Do you ever have days when you just run out of cheer and optimism? I seem to be having one today.

In the normal pattern of life around here I'm the one who goes to work each week like a metronome, keeps other people's spirits up, comes out with stupid jokes and basically tries to keep everybody else balanced. I just wish there was somebody doing the same for me sometimes. Somebody to go buy me a big tub of chocolate ice cream, and a bottle of wine. Right now.

In a fit of "I need to kick myself up the arse to do something about this" I have started trudging out in the direction of MySpace, and Yahoo 360 to see if I can make some new friends. If you're one of the prospective people who is reading this while trying to figure out if I'm not some kind of panty stealing weirdo from just up the street, you don't have any chocolate ice cream do you?

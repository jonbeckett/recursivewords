So we set out on another "Blog Journey". If you have no idea what I'm about to do, a little explanation is probably in order...

I came up with this idea one night last winter and did my first "blog journey" on my old Blogspot blog (I left blogspot due to their neverending ability to go down when I wanted to post).

The basic idea is that you start out at a random blog, have a read of it, write a mini-review of it, then either follow their blogroll, or a random comment or link to the next blog, and keep going from blog to blog - reading and writing potted reviews as you go. It's probably a good idea to email each blog author along the way too and let them know you've done it.

So where to start tonight? Following a quick lookup on Technorati, I find myself at...

"Pink is the New Blog"

http://trent.blogspot.com

First impression is that this is "just another" celeb picture blog with silly comments plastered over it, but then you start reading and get sucked in. The guy writing it is funny and smart - and obviously has his head screwed on in terms of publicising the blog; it's incredibly popular.

After reading about the various exploits of Madonna, Christina Aguilera and David Beckham (I still can't believe he got caught wearing socks and sandals), I started to look for a blogroll - and discovered that "Pink is the New Blog" has quite possibly the longest margin in the history of Blog-dom.

So - we look in the comments, and it leads us to...

"Go Fug Yourself"

Oh. My. God. When this one appeared on the screen I laughed a little bit just at the banner ad warning people to keep their children away from Tom Cruise - then I started reading and scrolling down, and my shoulders started shaking with the laughter.

The site seems to celebrate celebrities going out on the town in their latest greatest apparel, with little or no clue to how stupid/idiotic/hilarious (delete as applicable) they look. The picture of Jodie Marsh on a recent entry is priceless.

The writing is sharp and funny too. I'm bookmarking this one.

Next up its...

"Defamer"

http://www.defamer.com

At first glance I didn't really know what this blog was going to be about, but on reading a little further into it I started to like it.

The various reports are well written, and in the most part genuinely interesting. It appears to be an almost "everyman" view of celebrity culture, and the various deals, issues and stories that are happening.

It has a quality feel to it that many blogs are missing. Another one to bookmark.

Strangely "Defamer" has very few comments, so when I do finally find one that leads to another blog, I find myself at...

"Father Knows Shit"

http://fatherknowsshit.blogspot.com

Okay - I just read a couple of the entries in this one, and bookmarked it immediately.

The author is a new Dad, and the blog tracks his thoughts and experiences on that subject. The current entry - about witnessing other parents dragging their children from the Disney store, and the dawning realisation that this is all to come had me grinning from ear to ear.

The blog is sharp, witty, and makes you want to read more - to know more about this normal guy who (although he knows he should be just getting on with being a parent) is holding his hands up and telling the truth - that no first time parent has a clue what to do, or how to cope with anything.

Excellent stuff.

From here I follow one of the links to...

"The Best Page in the Universe"

http://maddox.xmission.com/

Just reading the tag line on this one made me laugh out loud - "This page is about me and why everything I like is great". Says it all really, doesn't it.

The postings are many and varied, and often incredibly funny, in the way only an opinionated writer who switches off their policital correctness can be. His summation about the "Hot Coffee" hack in Grand Theft Auto had me in stitches 

So there you go - a short and eventful blog journey. I found a couple of blogs that I'll be going back to, and that will no doubt provide great time wasting devices during the boring moments at work. Why not try a blog journey yourself - just wander out into the blogosphere and put one foot in front of the other.

As Mr Baggins said - "It's a dangerous business, going out your front door. You step into the Road, and if you don't keep your feet, there's no knowing where you might be swept off to."

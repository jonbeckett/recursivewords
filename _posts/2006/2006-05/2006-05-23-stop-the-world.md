(more about the gratuitous Serenity picture further on...)

This week is only one a three quarter days old, and already I want it to stop.

I managed to scrape myself out of bed fairly early yesterday (pretty amazing, considering I didn't go to bed until the early hours). I then found myself in meetings throughout most of the day, and the recipient of a number of thorny support calls. I then had to cycle home through torrential rain. You're starting to get the idea about my week, aren't you. Last night I went to bed at 2am in the end (after working on some programming for most of the night), and then got back up at 8 this morning.

Anyway. Enough about work and hassles.

Last weekend I did a bit of a "raid" mission to the second-hand shelves in Blockbusters. I came away with a big bag full of goodies for 20 - among them three DVDs and two PS2 games.

The DVDs were "Serenity", which I've been meaning to watch for ages, "The Brother's Grim", which I somehow missed at the cinema, and "Howls Moving Castle", which I also completely missed at the cinema.

We've watched Serenity, and while I thought it was good, I didn't think it was [i]as good[/b] as the fan-boys had been saying on the internet. The story was okay, the special effects were good, and it had humour. It didn't seem to have that much charm though. Also, did anybody else notice the surround is out of what on the DVD? I had to re-balance our surround speakers so we could hear the dialogue...

On a side note - am I the only person left in the world that calls the cinema "the pictures" ? I know a lot of americans call it "the movies", but then they always have their own "special" words for things...

The PS2 games I got were "MotoGP 4" for me, and "Ratchet & Clank - Locked and Loaded" for W. She spent all Sunday night and most of last night playing it. I've had a quick go on the motorbike game, but haven't really spent any serious time with it yet. It seems like fun. Perhaps I'll actually get a proper go on it today.

Ooh - while I think of it, while searching for something "new and shiney" to write about on my techie blog over at PluggedOut, I came across "Bebo" - a new community website. If you go and join, request "jonbeckett73" as a friend

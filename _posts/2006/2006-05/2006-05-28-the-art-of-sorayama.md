After talking to a new friend on messenger earlier, I realised that I know quite a bit about various artists and their work, and I never impart this knowledge to anybody. Time to do something about it!

The above painting is by a fantastic artist called Sorayama. If you recognise the style, you are recognising his style. He invented the modern human female/cyborg look. Something to be careful of though - if you go searching for more of his work on the internet, please don't be shocked - he's done a fair amount of commissions on erotic themes. Don't say I didn't warn you.

I just love the quality of the painting - it looks so real, and I know from experience how difficult that is to achieve.

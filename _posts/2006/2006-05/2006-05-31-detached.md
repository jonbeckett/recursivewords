For some reason for the last few days I have felt detached from my work, and (being truthful) life in general. I don't really know why either.

I decided a couple of days ago to try and give myself something of a kick up the backside by seeking out potential "new friends" on Yahoo 360 and MySpace, but that seems to require continual effort - something I don't seem to have at the moment.

I wonder if I can invent some kind of SOS "give me a hug" flair that can be fired across the internet? Of course the system needs to be invented in such a way that the scenes from the start of baywatch transpire as loads of babes come running down a beach in swimsuits to cheer me up... which would be closely followed by my other half pulling the plug out of the wall and clobbering me one 

Being serious for a moment, I really don't know what's up with me at the moment. I seem to be on the biggest downer for ages. Friends probably have no idea because I stick my happy head on whenever I'm talking to them, but there you go.

Perhaps I just need a holiday.

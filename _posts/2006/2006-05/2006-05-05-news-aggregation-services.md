I have been playing with Rojo this morning - and have come to to conclusion that it's one of the best RSS aggregators I have ever seen.

Before launching into this post, perhaps I better explain a couple of things for those that don't know;

RSS

RSS is the format by which news and content is published these days on the internet - it's a standard format. This means you can use something else other than the website to read it's content.

RSS Aggregation

You may have several websites that you regularly visit to read their news - what if you could suck all the news from those places into one place, where you can flick through it all? That's what RSS aggregation does. It's all made possible by RSS - because everybody is outputting their content in a standard way.

So. Back to our story...

I started out this morning playing with FeedDemon - which used to be the best "thick client" aggregator that money could buy. Unfortunately the guy who originally wrote Feed Demon has sold out to a big company - one of the web based Aggregation services called Newsgator.

So - I trudged off to Newsgator in a semi-resigned manner to see what they were like. I was impressed. Very impressed. I was impressed right up to the point where I started adding my own list of feeds to my free account, and suddenly realised that the folders I was making were not appearing. As a test I also tried to add the Slashdot RSS feed - and it refused to read it. Thats bad. The final nail was a visit to the Newsgator forums where people were complaining (very recently) about outages, and lack of service.

Isn't it a shame when a piece of software you knew and loved gets swallowed up and becomes less than it once was...

At this point I recalled a news story I read a while ago on TechCrunch summing up the various RSS aggregations services available on the web - and it led me back to Rojo - a very well designed feeds site that I looked at recently.

Here's what it looks like;

I spent a bit more time looking at it this morning and have been incredibly impressed - enough to make me start using it rather than BlogLines, which I have been using for the last year or so.

There are some very good ideas in Rojo - among them the way you can tag feeds and feed posts with your own "tags" to make them easy to find in the future; and you can also add "Mojo" to posts - which is a neat way of saying "this is an interesting post" to help other people find it.

The Rojo site is very well designed, and everything (so far) seems to be simple, and just does what it says.

This could very well be the first of many posts about emerging web technologies or sites - on balance, I probably spend far more time investigating this stuff than the people who read my blog.

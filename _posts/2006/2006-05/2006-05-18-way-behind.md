I know - I'm way behind with my blog.

Half the reason for not having written in my blog for a few days is because I've been distracted by a new toy... I have installed a "Wiki" on the PluggedOut webspace.

It's hard to describe what a Wiki does if you've not seen one, but I'll try anyway. Imagine you have a website, and imagine you could quickly go in and edit any page. Imagine that if you wanted to make another page, you just make a link to that page, and by going there it gets built...

You're starting to see how it works.

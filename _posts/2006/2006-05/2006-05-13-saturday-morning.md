I've been up since 7:30 this morning, and find myself in the unusual position of having the whole of the weekend stretched out before me with nothing planned. Of course, I think that at the moment, but W is bound to arrive back from town in the next few minutes and dictate what I'm going to be doing.

Since I've been writing in two blogs (I seperated the geeky stuff out to the "official" PluggedOut Blog), I have been discovering all kinds of new and funky projects on the internet. Just having the "task" each day to find something new to tell people about is pushing me to find out about all kinds of great new sites. Go have a read - you never know, you might find something great too!

Back to real life - apparently thunderstorms were predicted today so I should really go and cut the grass before the rain starts falling... I guess that will earn brownie points with W too...

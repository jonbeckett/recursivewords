On Saturday we went out with some friends to visit "a National Trust place". We didn't really decide where until we arrived at their house.

For those that don't live in the UK, the "National Trust" is an organisation that protect historic buildings and places - most of the big houses are under their protection, as are significant stretches of the UK coastline.

I have been to Waddesdon before - both to visit the grounds, and to a running race a couple of years ago. It's a huge place - the driveway goes through a couple of miles of parkland before you even get sight of the house. We wandered around the house and the grounds for several hours - amazed that a family once lived there.

The property is now owned by the Rothschild family (very rich, very old family) - they are the ones who opened it up to the public.

Sorry for the disjointed blog entry today... will write more later. People keep messaging me.

It's saturday morning, and I find myself firing the computer up to carry on with my work.

The sun is shining outside, and I'm missing yet another weekend to this project. It's difficult, because as much as I know I should be outside enjoying the day, I'm also a bit of a geek when it comes to complicated computer problems.

It showed itself with my cousin staying through this week. She brought her laptop with her, and I found myself horrified that she had no virus killer, and that the machine took so long to start up. After an evening of "doing my thing" she ended up with a clean, safe, fast computer. W said I have an obsessive compulsive disorder when it comes to computer. I don't think it's that bad, but it does annoy me when people install legions of crap on their computers, and leave a million files on the desktop. Most of my annoyances are based on knowledge that normal computer users don't have - like the fact that wallpaper eats memory. Drawing icons on the desktop eats memory and processor time. Running all the Quicktime and Realplayer update monitors eats memory and processor time... the list goes on.

Anyway - I have to get on with my work. If you happen to be reading this during Saturday feel free to message me and give me some distraction for a few minutes

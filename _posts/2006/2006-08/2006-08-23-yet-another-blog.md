While busy banging my head against a brick wall this morning in a manner only fellow software developers will identify with, one of my colleagues sent me an email invitation to start a new blog over at the WordPress website.

I have reluctantly agreed. God only knows how I might find enough time to write in another blog. I already write in two (LifeAndTimes, and the geekery that is PluggedOut).

Here's the URL if you are remotely interested;

The reasoning for writing in a third blog is to disseminate knowledge from my professional life - to spread nuggets of experience and wisdom that the company doesn't mind me spreading. It doesn't make sense to use PluggedOut for it, because it's typically used for "stuff I found" (you really should check it out if you haven't already - there's all manner of nerdy stuff).

While talking about "nerdy stuff", one of my friends mentioned in passing that she has a t-shirt with "talk nerdy to me" written on on. I want one. If I can't find one, I'm going to head on over to Cafe Press and make one. And a mug.

Returning to the normal subject of this blog (my intensely uninteresting life), today has been quite a good day so far. I've actually started to make some progress. I might even catch back up a little this afternoon.

I guess an apology is probably in order for the "woe is me" bulletin I sent out across MySpace too. What can I say - I was asleep on my feet this morning and wanted my pretend group of friends to all help prop me up...

It's funny really, isn't it - while writing in this blog, in my very own little corner of the internet, in my mind's eye I am addressing a group of people who are actually listening to me. What a strange concept...

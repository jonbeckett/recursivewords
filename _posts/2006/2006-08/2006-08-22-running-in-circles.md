When I came home tonight I planned on getting a big chunk of work done. Somehow inbetween getting home from work, and the clock striking midnight I have acheived nothing. Nada. Zilch.

It all started when W (W) arrived home from work and I asked if she wanted me to help her take photographs for her new website (nothing is quite as interesting as a new project when you're halfway though a huge, complicated project, and you're subconscious is looking for any excuse to do something else). Her face lit up, and she dissappeared upstairs to retrieve past knitting projects.

As she dissappeared off upstairs, she shouted "How many things are we going to take photos of?". "All of it", I foolishly replied. Following an extended period of thumps, crashes, and scrapes eminating from various rooms upstairs, she re-appeared in the lounge looking like she had won the "who can catch the most clothes falling from the burning building" competition. She would have made a good children's book character - maybe "the knitting monster" - which for all the world looked like a huge ball of knitted clothes with legs poking out the bottom.

I digress. We spent the next hour playing at being a photographer and a model, with W dashing in and out of the house doing quick changes of her clothes, and me crouching at odd angles to try and take photos in the dying evening light of the various garments without making her bum look too big (although, granted - I might have spent a few seconds more than necessary just having a look - hey, I'm allowed).

While transferring the photos back to the computer to start tweaking them for the website, the phone rang. An old friend wanted to pop round and discuss a business idea. And drink my beer. Now I'm not saying that I will use any excuse to drink beer with friends, but if they are going to let me talk about geeky stuff while drinking it, well... you can imagine.

We ran out of beer...

The upshot of the entire evening is that I got no work done at all. Add that to a frustrating couple of days at the office where I got next to nothing done either, and I'm starting to worry a little. Perhaps I shouldn't. Perhaps if I have a good day tomorrow, all will be well with my world again (I tend to be a little like a weather vane with stress at the best of times).

It's funny - when I hit low points as I'm heading towards at the moment, I tend to find myself looking around at my online friends, wondering if I'll hear from them - wondering if they'll help prop me up, or if they'll give me an excuse to avoid my work for a bit longer - after all, if you're in it up to your neck, another inch or two won't hurt.

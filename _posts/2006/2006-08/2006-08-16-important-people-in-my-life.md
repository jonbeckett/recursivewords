I actually seem to have regained my uber-software-developer mojo today. The keys are clicking. Code seems to be dripping from my fingers.

Isn't it weird how some days your mind can be "elsewhere", and on other days it is back, online, and available for business. Perhaps it's part of being a pisces - it's supposed to make me a dreamer, which might explain the "elsewhere" days a bit more.

I'm struggling here with avoiding an enthused post about the programming I'm working on - I know it will send people to sleep and cause all kinds of narcolepsy inspired accidents.

A meme. A meme would be a good way of spending this lunchtime... following a search on Google for "Blog, Meme", I came up with the following question;

Other than family members, who are the most important people in your life?

Hmmm... this is a really good question - I'll have a shot at it though. In no particular order (and keeping their names secret), here are the friends "that matter". It's going to be a very short list though - I don't have that many friends... (sad, but true).

 * A certain person who visited us recently - I wrote everything I need to say    in a previous blog post (click here to read it).          * This girl who lives and works in the US, living her dream and making glass.    I've known her online for years, and have one of those oh-so-comfortable    relationships where we can go weeks without saying hi, and then suddenly bump    into each other and start talking as if we only spoke yesterday. She used to    be a web designer, and was in the thick of the bay area during the dot com    boom. We very nearly met once in the Napa valley, but due to my own idiocy we    missed each other by a day.          * My best "real world" friends - an Australian couple that I met at a party    when I first moved to Marlow. We regularly catch up with one another when we    get the chance, and know that we are always there for each other should    disasters strike. The memory sticks in my mind from the time I had started    learning about Microsoft technologies (after being a Linux evangelist for so    long), and they both exclaimed "what's happened to our Jonathan!".          * D,G,T and Z. Isn't it great when good friends live just round the corner? We    are privilaged to have my other half's best mate and her fantastic husband    and children living a couple of hundred yards away. If ever two people were    meant to be together, meant to have have a family, and were the kind of    parents you might aspire to be, they would tick all the boxes.          * My saxaphone playing friend. He recently seperated from his other half, and    has been left in something of a tug-of-war over their son. He's what many may    call a dreamer, but both inspires me and infuriates me by equal turns. He has    perhaps the most brilliant and insightful mind of anybody I know, and is also    the most humble of my friends. Wonderful, wonderful person.        

So there you go. My mind-splurge for this lunchtime. Time to bring my brain back online once again...

In the absence of anything to write about at present, I thought a photograph from our various adventures might be in order.

I took the photograph during our epic treck through the Lake District in 2003 - we walked the 76 miles of the "Cumbria Way" from Ulverston to Carlisle over the course of 6 days. It's probably worth pointing out that the photo has not been modified in any way.

For those in various other parts of the world, the Lake District is the closest England comes to a "national park". The "National Trust" owns much of it, and prevents the commercial world from wrecking it too badly.

Myself and W have been members of the National Trust for years - they do a lot of important conservation work throughout the British Isles, and ensure that our rich history and surroundings are preserved for future generations to enjoy.

My cousin arrived at our house last night to stay for a couple of days, so I had a night off from the endless hours of overtime I've been doing recently. She is over to sort out living arrangements before coming back at the end of the month to stay for a year - she will be going to college in London.

Last night reminded me how close we are - and how much I enjoy her company. Sure, she makes me mad sometimes, but if we were all the same as each other the world would be a very boring place. It's just nice to be in the company of somebody who knows you inside out - and you them - and you don't have to "try". It's easy...

We travelled over to Oxfordshire to visit my brother and his family last night, and went out for dinner together at the local pub. My nephew was on fine form, and was desperate to show me his PSP - I seem to be something of a computer god in his eyes.

We had a great time catching up with each other, went back to my brother's for coffee, and then travelled home late last night. Today my cousin is staying at our place, so I've left her login instructions for the computer and a key for the door. We'll see how she gets on

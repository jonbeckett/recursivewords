I have decided - somewhat reluctantly - to move my development projects (PluggedOut Blog and PluggedOut CMS) to SourceForge.

Traditionally I have hosted them - along with support forums and a Wiki - here at PluggedOut, but with other commitments stopping me from doing much, opening the scripts up to other developers to extend, and hopefully improve should be a good thing.

Oh crap - look at the time...

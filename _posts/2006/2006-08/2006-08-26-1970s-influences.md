After watching the movie "Almost Famous" the other night (the same movie that caused an attack of introspection, and this blog entry), I have found myself digging out records that I have not listened to for a long time (if you are reading this and were born after 1985, a "record" is a 12C/3 vinyl disc that we used to buy music on. They actually sound better than CDs, and much better than MP3s).

So - "Almost Famous"....

It's very rare for me to like a movie this much - much less it's soundtrack. It reminded me of all the reasons I have grown to hate modern commercial music, and why I have an affinity for folk music, and "real" rock music.

I'm not going to say much at all about the movie because it will ruin it for you if you haven't seen it, but I will say that you will find yourself listening to those old vinyl albums again, and re-discovering why you thought they were so great all those years ago.

Here's the movie trailer too...

In the spirit of re-discovering the music and art of the 1970s I have re-tooled my MySpace profile - enjoy : http://www.myspace.com/jonathan_beckett.

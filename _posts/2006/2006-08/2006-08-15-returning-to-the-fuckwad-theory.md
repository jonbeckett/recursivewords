I spent some time tonight exploring MySpace, and while browsing the forums discovered that nothing has really changed in people's behaviour on the internet since the days I used to run a busy website. We experienced what has perhaps famously become known as the "Penny Arcade Fuckwad Theory"...

This theory was originally published at Penny Arcade a long time ago, but it's as relevant now as it ever was. Whenever I see fights break out in forums, I am reminded of it, and wonder how many other people have seen it.

Isn't it a shame that some people seem to fit the theory so well...

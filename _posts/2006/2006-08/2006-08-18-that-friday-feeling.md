I woke with a start this morning, and heard the garbage collection truck pass the end of our drive - the end of our drive that had no bin on the end of it because I forgot to put it out last night. I am beginning to wonder what my chances are of securing the world record for forgetting to put the bin out. After running across the landing, hastily trying to put my robe on (to avoid any "naked man in the window" episodes), I reached the window to see the back end of the truck dissappearing up the road. This of course meant "decision time".

What to do - resign myself to having to take the garbage to the local dump at the weekend, or run down the street in my robe, dragging our bin behind me. Based on the fact that I look more like a primate than a homo-sapien when I first get up (especially with not having shaved yesterday) I decided that I better not leave the house for fear of scaring small children.

While struggling to pull the robe on this morning, I wondered what quirk of physics determines that you will not be able to find the arm hole of a garment if you're trying to put it on quickly. I think the same branch of science can probably describe how (while stood on one leg) pulling a sock onto my foot detracts from my overall sense of balance.

The rest of the day - thus far - has been entirely predictable. Rain, thunder, lightning, and general miserableness. Having said that the sun did shine for the two minutes the sandwich man arrived at the office, but then it remembered it had to be somewhere else and the thunder started rolling again.

I have that "it's nearly the end of the week - why isn't the weekend here already?" feeling today. I have tons to do this afternoon though, so perhaps the afternoon may pass by quickly. You never know...

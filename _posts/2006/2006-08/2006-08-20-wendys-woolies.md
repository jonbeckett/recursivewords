My better half finally has her own blog on the internet - at present it is hosted at PluggedOut, but it will be getting it's own domain name in the near future. For the moment the URL is www.pluggedout.com/wool.

The blog will cover the knitting projects she is working on, and over the coming weeks will also encompass a gallery of items for sale. This year the main proceeds from the items for sale will be going towards Cancer Research.

Please do take a moment to have a look, and leave a comment. I've waved my geek wand over the site, making sure it supports RSS, and is easy to subscribe to. If you have any questions, go ahead and respond on the site!

In a world filled with people working their nine to five jobs like orwellian automatons, we all sometimes wish that we had pursued a dream, an interest or a talent, and perhaps found an escape from the prison that so many modern lives can become.

Hidden away in the suburban backroads of Beaverton, Oregon, Carli Schultz Kruse is making just such an escape.

Back in the heady days of the 1990s, Carli worked as a web designer for some of the biggest names in the business - working hard and partying hard through the "dot com boom", and surviving the "dot com bust" to tell the tale. In a tale familiar to so many that have worked at the sharp end of the IT industry, although the money was good, and being "there at the time" was great, Carli slowly became disillusioned with the job she loved.

Having always loved creative activities, she found herself taking a class in glasswork one summer and unwittingly stumbled upon a talent, a way out, and a possible future.

With property prices in the bay area rising stratospherically, Carli and her family made the decision to get out while they still could - if they still could, and following some determination and a sizeable slice of luck found themselves moving to Oregon in 2003.

Here was the chance. A chance to change tracks. Change career. Step away from the nine to five existence, and do something you believe in rather than something somebody else believes in.

Although still learning her trade, Carli has started her own glass studio, "juiceglass", working from the family home in Beaverton, Oregon. Making beads, bracelets, necklaces, plates and a variety of other high quality glassware, Carli sells both at craft fayres and through her own online store, and via auction to other jewellery designers. juiceglass is proving that if you believe in yourself, and have perseverence, courage and talent, then you really should take a step back. Take stock.

While you're driving to work tomorrow morning, think about it - Carli will be buying glass from the wholesaler, drawing designs for approval, and making glasswork you can't buy in any shop. She will be setting her own schedule, her own deadlines. She will be living the dream - tilting at the windmills of the daily commute, the nine to five job, and making us all a little envious that we're not doing what we wish we might.

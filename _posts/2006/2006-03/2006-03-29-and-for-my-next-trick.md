I have just spent the morning digging myself out of a development hole.

When I left the office yesterday evening I had a prototype system to be handed over to a salesman today that (a) wasn't finished, and (b) didn't work. Nothing concentrates my mind more wonderfully than the fear of letting people down - and based on that tennet I managed to pull the proverbial rabbit from the hat.

I handed the demo over about an hour ago, and can now race on to a load of HTML work to be completed by the end of the day.

I'll write again later with either a tail of woe, or jubilant celebrations at having squeaked through another development deadline...

I'm not sure why, but I got in from this work and just have no energy. Perhaps it's the result of a late night last night.

All I have done since I got in from work is sit, watch telly, help make dinner, drink wine and do nothing basically.

I'm sure I'll perk up a bit in the morning.

Until then, I thought people might like to take a look at some great things I've found on the web over the last few days;

Google RSS Reader

http://reader.google.com

Writely Word Processor

http://www.writely.com

iRows Spreadsheet

http://www.irows.com

I've been experimenting with the Google Reader in particular, and have been very impressed with it. Google are also playing with a web page authoring tool - pages.google.com - buy you need to have been a gmail member for a little while before they let you use it. It's very clever.

Anyway - I'm off to go sit and do some more nothing. I'll hear the laptop go ding if you message me via Yahoo, so feel free.

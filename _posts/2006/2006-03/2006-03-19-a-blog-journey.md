I just had a rather wonderful idea for a blogging activity when you're bored. I'm going to call it a "Blog Journey". Here's how it works - you go to a random blog that you regularly read, and write your perspective on an entry that has comments. You then pick a comment that has a link to another blog, and repeat - and you just keep going for as long as you want... documenting your views as you go.

Here we go then - my first journalled "blog journey" (I've put a few comments on the end for you to carry on where I left off)

My first visit is to one of the blogs on my blogroll...

Circe - The C Word

http://www.circe-gets-laid.com

I've been reading Circe for a year or so now - ever since I've used Bloglines probably. I'm not entirely sure how I came across her blog either. She writes the most amazing, searching blog entries about her daily life and thoughts. She tends to start her entries with poetry, and has a very individual view of the world.

The entry I'm reading is about her misusing her blog to keep record of when her last period was, and being publically horrified that she's doing it...

Radio Free Galador

http://rfgalador.blogspot.com

Okay - this guy has a very "homemade Sci-Fi" look to his blog. His most recent entry seems to be the lyrics to the title music from the movie of "Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy". They were sung by a band in the UK called "The Divine Comedy", and are one of my favourite bands. This blog journey looks like it's working rather marvellously to find new blogs to read  The author makes a great comment at the end of the lyrics that whoever reads them and knows what they are won't be able to get the tune out of their head... very true.

DarkNeuro's House of Musings

http://darkneuro.blogspot.com

Okay - I'm bookmarking this one immediately. This woman states in her bio at the top of her blog that she wants to write whatever she likes. Excellent. I thought I read a lot of blogs, but her blogroll makes mine look a footnote.

One of her recent posts is a wonderfully written reminiscence about going to watch Star Wars in 1977 with her family, and the vivid memories of the night. Curiously although I vaguely remember going to see Starwars too, my most vivid memory is of leaving the cinema and feeling fantastic. It may even be a false memory.

She also has a fantastic admission about her geekiness following her various aquisitions from the Starwars univers, and the various magazines she reads. Amazing.

From here, I follow a comment to;

Boulder Journal

http://boulderjournal.blogspot.com

Okay - I had to skip the first entry this guy had written, because it was all about a bondage flail he had just got in the post. I guess that's what you call it anyway... I won't judge - each to their own, as they say.

His next post is about dealing with stress, and how he has been reading too many blogs - how he has cut the list down in order to focus on those which he tries to read every day.

One of the comments leads to;

Pretty Dumb Things

http://prettydumbthings.typepad.com

Okay - this girl has a photo she has taken of herself in a mirror wearing some kind of bikini. She is fit, and I'm not sure what to think before I start reading. Remember she had been reading the previous guys blog, which seemed to be about bondage...

Hmmm. People always confound my first impressions. She has written a wonderful entry about her attempts to compose a seventy five word bio of herself. She is witty, entertaining, cutting and sarcastic by different turns. I love the one where she dumps on a previous partner by comparing the popularity of her blog with his 

One of the comments to the post leads to...

Eros Logos - Erotic Love and the Word

http://www.mycyberaffair.blogspot.com

First impressions here are that somebody either looks for graphic stuff on the net all the time, or has way too much time on their hands. Most of the opening screen of the blog is filled with graphics. It looks moody, but I'm more interested in what they have to say.

Okay - the first entry at the time I looked is a HUGE response to a meme about their favourite pieces of music, and the reasons they like them. This person has written PAGES about it. Hmmm... they like the Rolling Stones... why?

And there ends my first blog journey! I could have kept going, but where do you stop? You could carry on by jumping into any of the blogs I've listed and follow the comments. Comment back to me here if you do, so I can follow the path too!

Unless you are completely blind, or are reading this blog entry via RSS, you will notice that I have changed the template. It's still a similar layout to before, but is a bit cleaner and easier to read. I can't claim any credit for it - it's one of the "stock" blogger templates; although I did tweak it here and there.

Today is a relatively slow day at work - hence having time to write a blog entry. I'm in the middle of making prototype systems for various clients - following several such tasks recently, earlier this week I asked the managing directory if we could have an official badge on the door - "Smoke and Mirrors Department".

Building prototypes can be a dangerous game to play sometimes - you might illustrate something that is incredibly difficult to build - but the general idea is that somebody experienced builds the mock-up, so they only include ideas that are possible (at this point, people who work on IT projects will be starting to laugh, because they've been asked to build the impossible too).

Changing subject, today is W's birthday 

I wish I had more to write about, but I don't seem to at the moment. Perhaps something interesting will happen this evening...

I got up at 6:30am this morning to watch the Formula One race in Malaysia. What a complete and utter waste of time that was.

I'm now sat here, it's nearly lunchtime, and I have no idea what to do with the rest of my day. I've been to the newspaper shop - W is currently doing the sudoku puzzle. She's still in her pyjamas.

I guess I could switch a game console on - always good to waste a few more hours. Or I could carry on reading "The Great Gatsby", which I started the other night.

Listen to me. How bored do I sound... give me a shout if you're online.

I just did a meme over at http://www.tickle.com [http://www.tickle.com/] and answered the question "What do your Photos Say About You?"

Here's the answer 

We can see that you have more of an analytical mind than most people and that you're probably on hand to take record important events regardless of whether it is a wedding, graduation, or just the time when a group of friends came round for dinner.

This doesn't mean that you're herding people around in search of the perfect group photo, more that you think about the subjects more carefully than most. This attitude is also reflected in your personal life. We can't see you endlessly running blindly from task to task. It's not that you always take your time to do things properly, more that you think about the situation rather than just charging in to see what develops.

Sounds about right for a change

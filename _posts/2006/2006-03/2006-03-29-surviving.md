I survived the day (just). After working flat out throughout the day, I finished my work at 5:26 - with 4 minutes to spare inside my normal working day. Hopefully the rest of the week will be a little more relaxed.

When I got in from work (remembering I cycle to and from work on a mountain bike - about 3 miles each way) I went out for a run. I'm going to run the Marlow 5 again this year, so I need to get my fitness up, and lose a load of weight. This evening I only ran a couple of miles, but I expect the distance will come more easily over the coming weeks - especially if I do some weights, and some rowing. I just need to get into a routine.

W is still busy playing Lego Starwars. I have to admit - it's the best "fun" game I have ever seen - it rather handily compares with anything Nintendo has to offer. I'm not sure it actually beats Animal Crossing though.

Ah well... time to go and make our meal I suppose

It really shouldn't have come as a surprise that I didn't feel very well when I got up this morning - W was off work for the first half of last week, and I've not felt wonderful for days. I'm currently sat at home, watching the rain come down outside, sitting in silence with a headache and a head that feels like somebody jammed it full of cotton wool.

The events of Saturday probably didn't help much - I went for a run with some friends - the start of my training for the Marlow 5 in May. I haven't run any serious distance since last spring, so I really had no idea what to expect of myself. I ended up running about 4.5 miles (I chopped off the end of the route), and felt okay. I'm only guessing that it took more out of me than I thought, and where I was doing fine at stopping this cold (or whatever it is), knackering myself out probably tipped the balance.

Anyway - I won't drivel on and on about not feeling well. Nobody likes to hear people write about themselves all the time.

What else has been going on? I guess the only thing of note this weekend was me buying W "Lego Starwars" on the Playstation.

My little nephew had it a while ago, and W took a particular shine to it - last night was the first chance she got to play it, and ended up playing into the early hours. I really cannot enthuse about how good the game is - you have to see it, and play it to "get it". Imagine the entire Star Wars universe realised in lego blocks, and then imagine having lightsabers and force powers, and being able twirl your lightsaber through something, and it fall apart 

It's difficult to express without screenshots (or video) so I urge you to go and take a look at the GameSpot Review, or download the Official Trailer.

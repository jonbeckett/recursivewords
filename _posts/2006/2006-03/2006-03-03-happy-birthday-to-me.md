On Saturday 3rd March 1973, June Beckett gave birth to her second son. He remained nameless for several weeks while the hospital did every check possible on him; they suspected he was suffering from Hydrocephalus, more commonly known as Water on the Brain. It wasn't until they measured the father's head that they realised there was nothing wrong. Of course at this point his grandmother divulged that she had always had trouble buying hats for her son

 1. The world was a very different place in 1973. Ted Heath was the Prime     Minister of the UK. Nixon was still president of the USA, who were pulling     out of Vietnam. Elvis played to a billion people via satellite television     from Hawaii. The Russian "konkordski" (the Tupelov Tu144) crashed at the     Paris Air Show. Billie Jean King ruled womens Tennis. Princess Anne married     Captain Mark Phillips. Gerald Ford became the new President of the USA in     November. J.

R. Tolkein died. Olivia Newton John had an international number one with "Take Me Home, Country Roads". TCP/IP is inventedalthough it will not be used for what becomes the internet for another 10 years. George Lucas releases "American Graffiti". Bruce Lee stars in "Enter the Dragon".

There has been a wonderful series on the BBC recently called "Life on Mars"about a police detective in a coma who finds himself in 1973, where the world may as well be Mars. A world where women are subordinate despite the sexual revolution, where ambulance crews are not yet paramedics, where the police fight fire with fire, where furry dice are cool, flares and cuban heals make girls head's turn, and nylon shirts, denim jackets, and kipper ties rule.

I'm 33 today. I woke up this morning to a hug and a beaming grin from W, and a bag full of cards and presents from both her and various family members. I had to admit to being a little taken aback. I tend to just trundle through lifewandering from one day to the next, doing the best I can, oblivious to pretty much everything external. Then sometimes (like today) I am reminded how many friends and family I have, and am moved by how many people have bought me things.

Among the goodies were clothes, DVDs, computer games, CDs, and books. I am chuffed to announce that I did get the Buck Rogers set from my wish list I am happily planning to watch Wilma just enough until I need glasses.

On the way into work today I bought industrial quantities of cakes, and then sat back to watch the mob descend on receipt of my company wide email announcing their presence in the kitchen. I'm sat here now listening to my new Kate Rusby album, and thinking about making another cup of coffee.

Have a great day wherever you areand if you're online, give me a shout!

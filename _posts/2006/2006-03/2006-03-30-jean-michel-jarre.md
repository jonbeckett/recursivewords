I've been sat here programming all night, and thought I would take a bit of a break and tell you what I'm listening to.

The album is "Jean Michel Jarre - Live in Gdansk", and it's fan-bloody-tastic. There are some absolutely banging tracks on it, and it's making me think seriously about getting the DVD of the concert. It's certainly not an accident that most people regard Jarre as the father of dance music.

You can listen to some of it here.

There are some great choir tracks too - the concert took place in the G'Dansk ship yards, so they open up with the Industrial Revolution overture - Russian male choirs, rhythmic pumping of machines, etc... if you know Jarre's music, you'll be able to imagine.

I've been a fan of Jean Michel Jarre for years, and sometimes forget how much I like his music. It's not to everybody's taste, but most people seem to recognise that technically he leaves virtually all of the synth pop / dance / club music standing...

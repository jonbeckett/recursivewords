Those of you who have not been reading my blog for very long (or perhaps this is the first time you've seen my blog) will have no idea that I have written a "blog script".

A "blog script" is a program you can install on a web server on the internet that allows you to run your own blog - away from the rules and limits of services such as Blogger, Moveable Type, Yahoo 360, or whoever you might use to "have a blog".

If you want to see an example of it in action, click here. It's a very basic example, but it gives you some idea. To get more idea of what it looks like when you are writing your blog entries, take a look at the screenshots here.

This evening I have been working on the programming - the main task being to make the entire thing multi-lingual. It basically involved going through the entire thing, making sure that any english words appearing anywhere in the admin section are abstracted out to a language file.

Other things I want to look at are implementing "bbcodes" (as you might have seen in various forum solutions) - they are a simple form of mark-up for people who don't want to learn any HTML, and some form of comment verification (maybe copying a word or number from a box to prove you're not a robot).

I know... this is the most boring blog entry in the known universe, but it's what I'm thinking about and doing at the moment, and I write my blog for myself 

I expect I'll be on about beer, running, maths, UFOs, chess, or some such madcap interest before too much longer.

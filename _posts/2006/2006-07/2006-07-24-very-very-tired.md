I'm not really sure if I'm coming or going any more.

It's lunchtime on Monday at the time of writing. I'm having difficulty concentrating on anything. Perhaps the mental weekend might have something to do with it...

It all started after not going to bed on Friday night until about 2am because it was too hot to sleep. Following that, Saturday was filled with an attempt to catalogue about 7,000 photos on the computer, and then a trip out to visit friends later in the day. We arrived home at about 10, and didn't go to bed until the early hours once more.

Sunday began with a few hours work at home, and then a trip to the DIY store with W to help her buy things for her new bathroom. While walking around the DIY place I got the idea in my head that it would be good if we turned out junk room - that used to be a study - back into a study. Therefore I bought one of those vertical storage unit things with draws to throw things in - thinking I might be able to tidy the study up a bit.

Tidying the study up meant re-arranging it - and doing that meant throwing a legion of crap away. We took the seats out of the car, and make a pilgrimage to the local rubbish tip - depositing two computers, two monitors, a Yahama synthesizer, an old office chair, and prodigious amounts of cardboard and paper.

Turning the study around was one of those exercises you wish you never started. We had never really planned how to fit things into the study - they just arrived in the room when we moved in, several years ago. In order to move things around meant taking pretty much everything out of the room. Doing that seemed to fill three other rooms and the hallway with junk...

Just to cap things off, W announced that we were going over to have dinner with her family in the evening, so I had to leave the house looking like a bomb really had hit it.

I finally finished putting some of the stuff back in the study last night, and finally went to bed at about 1:30am. This morning I was back up at 8, and back at work.

Tonight the carnage starts again - trying to tidy up the attic so I can put about 40 boxes up there that are currently forming an assault course on the stairs...

Just before leaving the house this morning the postman came by, and delivered a jiffy bag. I stood in the hallway clutching it like a small child, almost too excited to inform W what I was holding.

This all started last weekend when I walked down to our local Blockbusters to raid their second hand game bin. I spotted Tekken on the shelf in the shop for 20, but decided that was far too much money to spend on a computer game - so bought movies, wine and chocolate instead.

On Monday morning during a coffee break at work I had a look on E-Bay to see what games were available - and there was Tekken with a "buy it now". So I did.

Five minutes later I got an email from W (also at work), titled "You've been buying computer games". After initially thinking that W must have telepathic powers, I decided that she must have received the purchase notification from E-Bay too (we have a joint account). Strangely, I don't get notification of her buying stuff... I wrote back with something along the lines of "I can't get away with anything any more".

So - I was faced with a decision this morning while stood in the hallway clutching the jiffy bag. Do I go to work, or do I phone in with some fictional illness and play Tekken all day?

Which do you think I chose ?

I have had what feels like the first chance in weeks to catch up with some of my friends blogs this afternoon - and almost feel like an outsider, which is weird because I've been reading them for a long time now.

While reading the various posts and catching up with what everybody has been doing, I found myself feeling bad about the general quality of posts recently on my own blog - I haven't had a great deal of time due to work. It reminds me of the famous phrase "too much work makes Jonathan a dull boy".

This blog has become dull - and it's about time I did something about it. I used to be so interested in the act of writing. I used to really try and make my writing interesting. I have repeatedly stated that I will write more informative and entertaining entries in "LifeAndTimes", and have not followed up on those promises.

Perhaps now is the time to do something about it.

Writing in a blog is a strange thing - I have likened it in the past to a conversation with an imaginary audience - some of which you might know in the real world, but most of which you may never know, and may never meet. Perhaps bizarrely, many of the visitors to a blog aren't even real - they are software routines from the likes of Google and Yahoo that are busy indexing your words for their archives.

On that note, I'll renege on the promise (for this post at least) as W is standing over me - we're off to see "Pirates of the Carribbean - Dead Man's Chest". Only W just discovered she hasn't got her credit card - it looks like the idiot girl at the garden centre didn't give it her back yesterday...

I'll let you know what happens later...

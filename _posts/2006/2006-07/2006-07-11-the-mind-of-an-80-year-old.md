I recently bought W "Dr Kawashima's Brain Training" for her Nintendo DS. I had a go on it, and am regretting it now.

The idea behind the game is that it fires quick-fire quizes at you, and rates the apparent age of your brain based on your performance at particular tasks. The quizes range from simple mathematics to remembering words (much like "kims game"), and various other observational, logical, or mathematical tasks.

Apparently the lowest age you can achieve with the game is "20" - meaning you have the "brain age" of a 20 year old. After a few days at it, W is at 21. I kind of expected it because she has an amazing memory, and is very quick with anything analytical (she works as a chartered accountant).

I have had two goes on it - on the first go it said I was 80, and on the second go it said I was 60.

I may as well get the spade out and start digging the hole now...

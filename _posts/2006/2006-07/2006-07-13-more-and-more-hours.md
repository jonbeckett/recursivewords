It's starting to feel like my life has dissappeared, and been replaced by endless hours of work. Today I crossed through 40 hours for the week so far - and we're not even at Friday yet. It's looking like another 60 hour week in prospect.

Among the stresses and strains of writing the software for the project I am having to do research here and there - through last night and this morning the nut to crack was "raising events in Internet Explorer from C# winforms usercontrols". This really was ragged edge "clever stuff", and way out there on the fringes of what I know as a developer with many years of experience. Thankfully at lunchtime I managed to figure it out, and then spent an hour writing it up to give back to the community on the internet, and for the use of my colleagues.

I feel quite strongly about giving knowledge back where appropriate - I use the internet heavily when trying to learn things, so feeding results back is the "right thing to do".

It's 9pm as I write this, and I'm probably going to do another hour this evening before packing up.

One great thing about immersing myself in the work over the last couple of weeks is that I am now far more accomplished with C# and visual studio than I was before. Sure, I could write programs before, but hadn't really touched on any of the clever stuff in "dot net".

Looks like dinner is ready - W has been making me wonderful meals to help support the slog. Word cannot describe how much I love her

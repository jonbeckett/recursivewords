After a trip late yesterday afternoon to our local Blockbusters, I raided the bargain bin of second-hand games, and came away with Soul Calibur 3.

The picture above is not artwork - it's in-game. I am continually amazed at how far the PS2 is being stretched late in it's life. This game really is a stunning achievement - it looks amazing, and plays wonderfully too. As soon as I got it home W said "right then - where's the other controller" 

I cannot re-iterate enough - playing fighting games against other people is SO much more fun than playing against the computer. Actually, playing ANY game is more fun.

You would be surprised if you found out how many normal board games we play against each other...

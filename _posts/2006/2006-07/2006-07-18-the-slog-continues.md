This is going to sound mad... it is Tuesday evening, and I am already crossing the 24 hours of work mark for the week so far. The subject of study this evening is "Code Access Security" - or more accurately, "How to strong name user control and web service assemblies, and then register those assemblies for use on a client computer".

I wish I had a big book all about this stuff, but no books seem to exist. I feel a bit like Lex Luthor in the latest Superman movie - peering into the Abyss towards the oracle, and saying "Tell me everything...."

As a slight aside, I'm listening to possibly my favourite album at the moment - "City of Walls" by Paul Mounsey. I bought it at Stirling Castle in Scotland a couple of years ago. His music is fantastic - very evocative of the people and landscape up there. Think along the lines of some of Howard Shore's music from the Rohan sections of LOTR, add a big helping of "folk" and a spoon of Mike Oldfield, and you're getting somewhere near it. I just discovered a nice bio at "FootStompin".

Anyway - time to get on with more work (I've been waiting for a 5 gig virtual machine to decompress from a ZIP file while writing this). If I get time later I'll try and catch up with friends blogs.

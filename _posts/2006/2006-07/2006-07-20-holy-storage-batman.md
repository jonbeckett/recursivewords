I think this might have to be a geeky post.

I had a portable hard drive delivered at home today to keep backups of both mine and W's computers on. Aside from keeping entire copies of the computers, it's also going to be used as a travelling data store for when W goes around the country researching family history. It's big enough to hold about 400 CDs worth.

Aside from that, I just signed up with the Amazon S3 service, and am busy backing up our data to it. For those that have no idea, "Amazon S3" is a web service they are providing to use their storage network to store whatever you want - it's really cheap too. Basic costs are 15 cents per month per gigabyte, with slightly more to actually transfer the data. Our main reason for doing it is because we are accumulating so many digital photographs. This gives us an "off site backup" capability for a very reasonable price - meaning our photos won't get destroyed in any disaster such as a fire.

What else has been going on in my world? A new 17C/3 flat screen arrives tomorrow for my computer at home too - which means I'll finally be able to get going with the cartooning. Expect lots of rather ropey first attempts in the near future.

And on that note I'm going to call it a night. It's midnight, and I have work tomorrow.

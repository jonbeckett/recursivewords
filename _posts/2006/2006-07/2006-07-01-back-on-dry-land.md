We are finally back on dry land after our adventure on the high seas.

We left on Sunday morning at 7am from Torpoint, and sailed for the Isles of Scilly - reaching St Marys (the biggest island) at 6pm that night. Over the days that followed we visited one of the neighboring islands, and then sailed back to the mainland - hopping between Penzance, Falmouth and Fowey on our journey back.

I'll write more in the coming days - for the moment I've uploaded a few of the photos to Flickr (we took nearly 500 and several chunks of video). Perhaps the hilight is the basking sharks...

While it was great to be away for a while, it's nice to be back too.

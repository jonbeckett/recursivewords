While wandering around John Lewis yesterday (in the process losing half a day of programming time), I was walking past the electrical department and saw the WACOM graphics tablets out of the corner of my eye - and for far less money than I have ever seen them before.

I bought the baby one. I've had a quick go with it so far, and it seems to work as you would imagine. All I need now is a copy of photoshop (I don't think Paintshop can really compare), and I'm ready to start drawing cartoons 

I'll probably still follow the same routine that a lot of the other comic book artists follow - do the ink on paper, and take it through to the computer as a scanned image. The pen makes colouring in very easy indeed - I just need to learn how the graphics software works to make my life as easy as possible.

Anyway... I need to get on with my work (yes, I'm working on a Sunday... again.) At present I'm re-writing somebody elses code to make it give back exact reasons why it might not be able to do what it's supposed to do.

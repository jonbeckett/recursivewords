It's late afternoon on Saturday, and I am finally having some weekend. I've hit a bump in the programming I am doing for work, and can't be bothered to investigate it at the moment (the problem is deep in the object model called from a web service through a proxy, and I didn't write any of it - I'm tempted to wait until Monday to progress that bit, after talking to the original developer of the web service).

Anyway. It's finally the weekend. I worked last night, and I worked most of today. I might wander into town in a bit and see if there are any good second hand PS2 games around at the moment.

p.s. we're going to see Pirates of the Caribbean 2 tomorrow night

Over the last few months I have found myself with very little time outside of work to persue my own interests, and have been watching television less than ever before. Without exaggerating at all, I can honestly say that I've spent more time in the cinema over the last month than watching television.

With this in mind, I have found myself reading regularly again. My only time for reading at the moment tends to be for half an hour or so before I go to bed, but at least it's something.

I've always loved books. They require imagination and escapism. You tend to participate in a book far more than a movie - in the book you actively decide how people look, and how they sound. I find it far more engaging than movies.

Anyway - I'm not sure if I've written about this in my blog before. I run a reading group. It's over on Yahoo Groups, and is called Bookworm Corner.

The main idea is for a group of people to read the same book as each other during the month, and discuss it afterwards. Also, during each month members suggest books to go into a poll for the next month, which is then voted on, and so on. That's really all there is to it.

I started the group because I was getting a bit fed up of reading books and having nobody to talk to who had read the same book. I also wanted some way of forcing myself to read books I otherwise wouldn't have looked at.

So there you go - Bookworm Corner. Why not visit today? It's free to join (you just need a Yahoo account, which is also free)...

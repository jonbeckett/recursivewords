Unfortunately blog posts may be very scarce on the ground over the next few weeks - I am working on a project at work that has had all overtime approved in order to meet a deadline.

To give you some idea, I've just logged over 24 hours worth of work in two days, and don't see that improving any time soon. I'm fully expecting to work all weekend, every weekend through this month.

If I don't get a chance to read your blog, I apologise, and will try to catch up later in the year.

It's Thursday morning, and so far this week I have logged over 35 hours work. At this rate, I'm going to hit something like 60 hours at some point over the weekend. How crazy is that?

I'll write a proper entry when I get more time - in the meantime, feel free to message me and give me some distraction/entertainment

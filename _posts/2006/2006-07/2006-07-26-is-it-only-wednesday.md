It's Wednesday morning, and I feel like it's the end of the week already. So far I have logged over 24 hours work for the week so far. That's in two days. If things keep on like this, I'll have done my normally weekly hours in 3 days, and will be looking at 80 hours for the week.

In the past I always seem to have found something to write about in my blog, but that kind of depends on "having a life" in order to write about it. Seeing that I have no life at the moment, and am not allowed to write about work, I'm a bit stuck.

I'm guessing that what I really need to do is spend my coffee breaks looking for distractions on the web - if anybody can suggest great websites to go visit, let me know...

I just realised what the time was, and NaBloPoMo popped into my head. It has a habit of doing that. I apologise in advance for a disjointed and badly written post - my mind is disjointed and badly organised today. I am also very tired after another 6am start, and 8pm finish.

By the time dinner had been eaten and cleared away this evening it was 9pm. Goodbye evening.

The remainder of my evening will be spent commenting on other people's blogs. I just don't have enough intellectual energy to write anything of note.

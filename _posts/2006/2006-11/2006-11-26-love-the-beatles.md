While out shopping, quite apart from finally aquiring a Moleskine notebook, I spied the new Beatles album "Love"...

There are not enough superlatives. Imagine The Beatles had walked into a recording studio today, and their signature tracks had been recorded properly in stereo, with swirling vocal harmonies flying around the room. Suddenly the strings in "Eleanor Rigby" are deep and haunting. The clarity of "Yesterday" stops you in your tracks - Paul is in the room with you. "Here Comes the Sun" retrospectively shows Coldplay, Travis, Badly Drawn Boy, Kasabian and any number of modern bands just how these kind of tracks should be done.

If you enjoy real music, written and performed by real bands, this is one album you really need. Like I said - there are not enough words to enthuse about it. You have to experience it.

The one we got wrong...We just got back from the pub. We performed hilariously badly. 14 out of 30.

In our defence, the winners only got 20. W had an inspired moment when we were asked the surname of "Harry" in the "Dirty Harry" movies - three questions after being asked, she suddenly piped up "Callaghan?".

We failed to name the president on the one dollar bill. W insists that she told us it was George Washington, but we went with "Benjamin Franklin" based on the slang we all knew - that one of the US notes were known as "Benjamins". The American's reading this will thing we are stupid for not knowing it, but answer me this (if you live in America) - who is on the UK 5 pound note (other than the queen) ? We are arguing about it right now.

Our notable success was the picture round, where we correctly named all the faces except one (we had to identify childhood photos of celebrities) - we mistook a photo of a 5 year old girl as Britney Spears, when it was Angelina Jolie. I would argue that they are never seen in the same place at the same time. Actually, that doesn't really work, does it. Oh dear...

We got all the music questions wrong. We also didn't know that some woman cycled from Hong Kong to England. W insists she knew this too. We wondered how she cycled across the ocean, but after several drinks this became clear - she obviously either over-inflated her tyres, or had an aqualung and cycled across the seabed.

This "Thursday Night Quiz Night" at our local pub is turning into a regular thing - and we both agree it's a great thing. We get to spend time with good friends, and forget about everything for a few hours. In the midst of the adoption course we forgot everything a bit too much and felt terrible the next morning. It's funny how your body forgets how to deal with alcohol.

14 out of 30. That's so crap...

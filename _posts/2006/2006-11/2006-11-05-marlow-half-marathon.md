Today saw the running of the Marlow Half Marathon, which W's mum took part in. This saw me up and about at an unusually early time on a Sunday morning in preparation for their arrival at 9 this morning.

Here's a photo of the start of the race...

And to the right we have an image of W's Mum as she came over the finish line in the park. I am glad to say that I do not have any wish to run further than the annual Marlow 5 mile road race - and my body more or less stops me from doing so (I have some kind of weird condition where my joints are too flexible, and it causes strain on tendons to run more than about 5 miles - I learned this the hard way).

Anyway - that was the story of my Sunday really - off to the park early, wander round town, back home for a cuppa, then back to the park, then to the pub for lunch, then home for coffee, and here I finally sit.

I promise to have something intellectually interesting to write about by tomorrow. For a few more photos from the day, visit my Flickr page.

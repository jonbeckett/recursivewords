It would appear that Winter is finally upon us...

This morning saw thick fog, and freezing temperatures across the south of England. I decided while half way to work that fingerless gloves really weren't the best idea. The cold affected the camera too - the motor that pushes the lens in and out of its protective cover seized up (it started working again once I got it back in the warm).

Coffee... I need a cup of Coffee...

My Google Mail account got hacked last night. I'm not so much worried about loss of personally sensitive information (there wasn't anything too terrible in my emails) as I am annoyed with the necessity to now go through every major website I am a member of, and change my login password - because every membership confirmation email may have been compromised.

I have also had to go through the various web hosting accounts I hold, and change their login details too. I am still in the process of doing this, and it's going to take a long time. I have done a huge number of them already, but it's technical and fiddly in places - and easy to forget places to check.

It does mean I'll stop leaving my email in Google Mail - I'm back to using an email client on my computer again. This is going to mean forming my own backup and security strategy though.

Think about it - getting your email account hacked is one thing, but what if your computer at home was stolen? How would you stop the thief walking straight into your email client and reading all your emails...

Today started fine. I got up, had a shower, got dressed, made some lunch, packed my bag, and went to work.

I then arrived, and started catching up on emails (remembering that I had been out of the office for a few days, so the pile of email was... oh - about 6 feet high).

There it was. Meeting. 11:30am. Reading (about 25 miles away). I had completely forgotten about it.

I also had to go see my manager, and the HR manager - so I was in meetings through until 10:30. After a period of blind panic, I managed to organise a taxi to take me to the meeting, so some normality could return to the world. While travelling there it occurred to me that I was not dressed for the meeting - combats and skateboard top instead of shirt and tie... ah well - they want our business, not us theirs.

I finally arrive, meet one of my colleagues there, and we discover that the meeting is covering the same stuff that we saw 6 weeks ago in a private demonstration at our offices. What's more, we were the only developers there - everbody else was managers or consultants. The entire day was a waste of time.

I am home now, and about to go take out my frustrations on the X-Box or something.

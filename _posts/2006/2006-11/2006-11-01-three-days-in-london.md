For the next three days I will be commuting into central London to work on-site on a client project. This will mean getting up at 5am, and getting home at 8pm. I'm not looking forward to it, but it has to be done.

Of course it's sods law that NaBloPoMo starts tomorrow too - so I may have to be a little creative in finding time to blog; I'm already predicting that the blogging may take place on my work laptop, and then get updated after dinner each evening.

Attempting to see the next few days in a positive light, at least I'll have something to write about each day. London is a big place - I'm bound to bump into some complete nutcases.

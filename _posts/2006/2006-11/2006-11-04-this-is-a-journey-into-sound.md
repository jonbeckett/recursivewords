I just logged into emusic and discovered I have 118 credits in the bank - that's 118 tracks of music I can download for free (except of course it's not free, because I pay them every month for those credits).

Of course now I have itchy mouse fingers - what to listen to? what to buy?

My previous "favorite find" on emusic was "Dar Williams" - a wonderful singer songwriters from the US. Most people would probably class her as a country artist, but I wouldn't - she's just a very good singer songwriter. I still have one of her albums on my MP3 player that has been travelling to London and back with me recently. There is this track - "The Hudson" - that makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.

I'm weird with music - I like most styles and genres, but if you asked me why, I doubt I would be able to explain. I can perhaps illustrate with examples.

I like people who sing in tune, with no assistance. I like songs that tell a story. I like bands who write their own material, and perform it without session musicians. I guess what I'm saying is that I like to listen to those that are obviously talented; I cannot sing a note, so I admire their talent greatly.

Any suggestions for little known artists that I should be looking up? Come on - 118 tracks is a lot of vinyl

I sit down, take a sip from my cup of tea, and light bathes my face. Fingers dance across keys. Within the machine virtual cogs turn, pipes open, and information bursts forth. Nobody.

This is the third night this week that I have finally found time to sit at the computer, and the third time that none of my friends have been online. It's a very lonely feeling - seeing none of those names emboldened. Hard to describe.

I shall console myself by playing some really rather melancholy music at depressingly loud volume. Coldplay. Travis. If I really need to drop to inky depths, Beethoven may find his way back into the room. Nothing quite like wallowing in the 7th Symphony.

Elgar. Now there's some depressive music.

How does my mind wander into such dark areas? Perhaps it's the other side to being so friendly and well regarded? While stood on a train platform the other day, watching hundred ton trains thunder past the platforms I actually caught myself wondering what would happen if a train hit you. Would you be snuffed out, or would you continue in some bizarre way? My rational mind decided on "snuffed out". Stop. End. The end of all things.

It's an unpopular opinion, but I tend to think many people become religious in later life because they are scared of the unknown - they try and populate the unknown with something acceptable to them.

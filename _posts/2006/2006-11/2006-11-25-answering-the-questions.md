Firstly, I would like to extend a huge thankyou to those who commented on my previous request for questions. I shall endeavour to answer them in as interesting a manner as possible in this post without (hopefully) sending you all to sleep. Without further ado...

What's the most ridiculous thing you have done while drunk?

I nipped out to the kitchen to re-fill my glass one night while "staying in" with a great girl friend I used to have, and was found several hours later curled up around the base of the washing line pole in the garden, in the pouring rain.

If you were stranded on a desert island and could only bring one (physical) item, what would it be?

My first instinct would be a magic lamp, but I've heard far to many stories where the wishes went wrong - so I would probably plump for a yacht. It would seem logical to take something to aid in your escape...

What would you like for christmas?

I'm one of those awkward people to buy for, that doesn't really "want" for anything. I like gadgets, books, music... that kind of thing. Can I be abstract, and ask for a "happy Christmas" ?

What do you enjoy most about blogging?

It's not so much that I enjoy blogging - it's more that I use blogging in differing ways depending on my mood at the time. I use it to reach out to people, to discuss my thoughts out-loud, and to share my life and experiences with an imaginary audience. I guess that's the thing I enjoy most - sharing things.

Why do people paint on the top of wallpaper?

Because they are incredibly lazy. Like the people we bought our house from, who wallpapered over a 6 inch hole in the wall.

With regard to adoption, male or female child, and how many children?

I (we) have no preference on male or female - and while we would love to take on more than one child, we don't think we'll be able to handle more than three. I have a brother, and W has two brothers. We are used to an environment where we had siblings to share our adventures and experiences with.

(I am going to have a mad, raging fit at this point - I just got as far as answering about 16 of the questions, and pressed a key by accident in the web browser - which instantly wiped out everything I had typed)

If you could wake up tomorrow having gained one ability or quality, what would it be?

The ability to fix things - to put things right. Wouldn't it be wonderful when you see that somebody is sad, or upset, to be able to wave some kind of wand, and make things better for them?

If you could write your own dream tonight, what would happen?

Hmmm.... I'm probably not allowed to involve Palema Anderson and Kylie Minogue (along with a sudden shortage of clothes), so I guess I need to think of something a bit more constructive. Naughty dreams are always fun, but I suppose it would be good - just for once - to have a dream that made sense - where the places and people in it belonged where they turned up, and joined together in a logical way.

When did you last sing to yourself?

I read this question out to W last night and she laughed. Apparently I had been singing some incoherent jumble ten minutes before while making a cup of tea. I regularly hum or sing bits of songs - although, strangely, I never sing an entire song and cannot remember more than one or two lines of most songs.

If you could live anywhere in the world, where would it be?

With W. Georgraphy isn't important to me at all - although saying that, I do like living somewhere relatively quiet. I would have problems living in the middle of a big city.

If you could go back and correct one thing in your personal history, what would you choose to fix?

I would not have stood on Amanda Broadbent's fingers when I was in infants at school. If I had not been able to avoid it, I should have owned up to it rather than claiming I didn't do it. This happened 30 years ago, and still haunts me.

What is your perception of Americans?

This is a difficult question to answer. The United States of America is a huge country with many cultures - so the question is a little like asking "what is your perception of humans". The Americans I know as close friends are wise, funny, intelligent, clever, generous, and any number of other traits you might wish to find in people - but I'm not sure if everybody thinks that of their friends (in the same way that you defend your friends without sometimes really knowing what they did). If I'm going to be forced to tar all Americans with the same brush though, I would say that there are too many rich people who care too little about those who are poor. The general level of education - particularly of the wider world - is woeful.

Boxers of Briefs?

Boxers - but the stretchy, form fitting ones.

What did you want to be when you grew up?

A hotdog man. I had it all worked out - I knew how much sausages and bread cost from the local store, how much a van might cost to run, and of course I loved sausages, which was probably the main reason.

If you had to marry a male celebrity (to save the world), who would you choose?

This isn't really fair, because I'm already married. If you take into account that it would only be a technicality for legal reasons or whatever, I wouldn't care. They could plonk anybody down in front of me. If I had to consimate the marriage though... ewww! (I'm not going there). Let the world end... lol

What do you think about moustaches?

They make me laugh. I can never imagine myself having a moustache. I would look too much like Luigi from the Mario games. I have heard the old wives tail that you can never trust anybody with a beard - I'm not sure if that applies to moustaches too, but it's certainly hovering around in the back of my mind.

What did you enjoy the most in school?

A pudding we had at primary school called "Jam Roly Poly". It was kind of a pastry and Jam roll thing with custard. I have never seen it since, and have an entirely fantasised view of what it might have been like now. It was probably nowhere near as fantastic as I recall.

What's one piece of advice you would give your younger self if you could time travel?

Oooh. Good question. I would probably try to tell myself not to worry about not having as many friends as some people seemed to have. I would tell myself that when i grow up, people might actually seek me out as a worth and valuable friend.

If you had to live your life in a book, which book would you choose?

Another difficult question. Maybe something by Charles Dickens. On the other hand, wouldn't it have been great to have been a friend of Miss Elizabeth Bennet or Mr Darcy in Pride and Prejudice - just to grab them by the shoulders and give them a shake! "Look - he loves you!", or "Look - she loves you!"

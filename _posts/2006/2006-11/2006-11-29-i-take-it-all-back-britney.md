I sit down, fire up Mozilla Thunderbird to check my email, then over to Google Reader to catch up on news and blogs, and...

Gah.... keck.... spit.... choke.....

You know how I wrote a blog post a little while ago about feeling sorry for Britney Spears? I take it all back. The photo below is the only one from her recent "night out" that I can remotely publish on a blog without fear of my web host pulling the plug for posting porn...

The rest of the pictures (which you can find here if you really are desperate to see everything she has), are probably better termed "gynaecological" rather than "sexy".

It makes me wonder who was looking after the children while she was out being a vacuous idiot with Paris Hilton, and why she did it - this isn't after all a flash of knickers.... this is what she had for dinner. Any empathy I might have felt for her got erased when I saw those pictures, and I kind of feel sad about it.

If I hadn't been nosey and clicked on the link, I might still have fought her corner.

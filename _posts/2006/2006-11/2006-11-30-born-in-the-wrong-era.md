Is this a myth perpetuated by artwork, or did all women look like the one on the front of this book in the 1950s and 60s ?

Was I born in the wrong era? Why is this image far more appealing than the stick-thin or inflatably enhanced ideals we are bombarded with today?

I wonder if the story within the above book lives up to the rather wonderful cover? Why do they not have covers on books like this any more?

These are the important questions of our time...

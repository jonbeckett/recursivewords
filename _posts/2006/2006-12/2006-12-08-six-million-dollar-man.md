Sorry for the absence of a "real" post this evening, but I just came across this on YouTube, and had to share it;

When I was a kid in the 70's, "Steve Austin" was it. I used to run around with my friends, doing the bionic squint and everything. We could all do the sound effects too... "na na na na na na na naaaa". It was serious stuff.

God this clip takes me back...

While out Christmas shopping yesterday, I picked up a couple of things for myself - one of which was the first part of "Ghost in the Shell" on DVD. I'm trying to figure out how best to describe it. If you have not seen an anime movie before, it's basically a cartoon with an adult storyline (that's not to say it's full of smut - just that it has quite an involved story, and the occasional adult theme).

I have to admit to only having seen one or two anime movies - I saw Akira many years ago and didn't really "get" it. Since then I have warmed to them a lot though - having seen "Howls Moving Castle", "Porko Rossi", and the wonderful "Spirited Away". I have always been interested in the artwork more than the stories.

Anime and Manga have something that draws me to them. It may be that the characters and the stories are far more plausible than the likes of DC comics, where underdog hero's or superheros always save the day. Anime and Manga are far more likely to wrap stories around anti-heroes. The kid who doesn't fit in. The stranger that nobody talks to.

I will of course let you know what I think of Ghost in the Shell after I've watched it (it's worth pointing out that it's a series - and I only have the first DVD of a set).

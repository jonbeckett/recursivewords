While having a rather silly conversation this morning about the belief children have in "Father Christmas", I remembered something I invented when I was young - the Reindeer Bucket.

Here's the problem that faced my four year old mind - we live in a house with a pitched roof. If we put a bucket of water out for the reindeer, it's going to slide off the roof (it hadn't entered my mind that the crest of the roof is a pretty narrow ledge for an entire team of reindeer pulling a fat man in a sledge to balance on, but still...

I came up with perhaps the first clever invention of my young life (at least - the first one I can recall).

Here's the idea. Imagine you get a bucket, and cave the bottom in so you can balance it on the crest of a rooftop. Dannaaaaa 

What do you think? Have I been sat on an idea for the last 30 years that could have made me a millionaire?

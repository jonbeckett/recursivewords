Today's post to the soon to be year-old blog known as "Life and Times" marks the end of 2006, and the beginning of 2007. We have been staying with my parents in Cornwall for the New Year - just over 3 hours away as I write this - and it's been a fantastic break so far.

Today was special for another reason. Today I met a wonderful friend and her family from "the internet" that (by complete coincidence) live about 10 miles from my parents - she write's a blog called "Gwelva Kernewek", and lives with her family who help run a farm in Cornwall. We all got on fantastically well, with a strange sense that we had always known each other.

This is perhaps the gift of the internet for our generation - the ability to bring people together who would otherwise never have met. It's weird - meeting people you have known online - the whole "getting to know you" thing is removed. After fighting to get a word in edgways with the six way conversation over the dinner table, I found myself sat on the living room floor with two wonderful little girls, finding out exactly how much I didn't know about Doctor Who, and the names of each pony in the My Little Pony wagon train.

W has always been right - children are drawn to me, and I to them.

So there you go - it's been a "different" year, but a very good one. Myself and W have both made huge decisions in terms of our future this year an acted upon them in terms of the adoption. We have also made the most wonderful new friends (you know who you are), and found support and help from the most unlikely people.

There have been bad times during the year (without the bad, there could be no good), but we both think they have made us stronger, wiser and (we hope) more able to cope with the hurdles that lie just down the road.

I guess the one thing I will take from this year is the friendships. You know who you are - both old friends and new, in England, America and elsewhere. Here's to you - you mean the world to us.

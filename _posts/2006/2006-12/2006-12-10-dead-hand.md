I disovered just how quickly you can wake up if you are in a state of panic this morning. Here's what happened (a transcript of thoughts, if you will...)

Hmmfff. Oh. I'm awake. I wonder what time it is? (I turn my head on the pillow to catch a glimpse of the alarm clock)... 9:30. Crap - there goes part of Sunday already. I guess I better go make a cup of tea. That's weird - I can't feel my right hand. REALLY - I CANNOT FEEL MY RIGHT HANDarm out. Immediate pins and needles. Slowly the instructions from my head got through to my hand, and it started to work again.

I do NOT want that to happen again.

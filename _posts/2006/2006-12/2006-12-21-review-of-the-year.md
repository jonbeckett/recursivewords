The idea to do this "review of the year" came from W, who has done a similar thing.

The basic idea is that you post the first sentence of the first post from each month - I've helped things a little by linking through to each story too.

It's been a very "different" year...

Tuesday 17th January - "A Beginning"

"All blogs have to start somewhere, and this is the start of this one."

Thursday 2nd February - "Absolutely Knackered"

"I think I might be experiencing what some people call 'burnout'."

Thursday 2nd March - "It's nearly my Birthday"

"I am going to be 33 years old tomorrow."

Sunday 2nd April - "Working on the Blog Script"

"Over the last few days I have been working on my blogging script, and finally released an update for it."

Monday 1st May - "Surviving the Fun Run"

"I took part in a 4.5 mile "fun run" in Oxfordshire this morning. I would like to say I did well, but that would be a bare faced lie."

Friday 2nd June - "King of the Idiots"

"Nobody will be interested in this post apart from the geeks among you."

Saturday 1st July - "Back On Dry Land"

"We are finally back on dry land after our adventure on the high seas."

Wednesday 2nd August - "A Night Off"

"My cousin arrived at our house last night to stay for a couple of days, so I had a night off from the endless hours of overtime I've been doing recently."

Friday 1st September - "It's Official - I have the Lurgi"

"While stood in the bathroom brushing my teeth this morning, I noticed red weilds around my neck and thought "hmmm that's not right"."

Tuesday 3rd October - "Zombies - Aim for the Headsuccessfully."

In closing, I would just like to say thankyou to anybody who reads my little corner of the internet, and who makes the effort to comment from time to time.

I know some of you a little, and most of you less than I wished I might (that sounds suspiciously close to Mr Baggins speech at his birthday party).

As the tutor in Bill and Ted said - "Be Excellent".

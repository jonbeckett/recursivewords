We invited friends and neighbors round last night for drinks and mince pies, and it finally feels like Christmas has arrived.

It's rapidly turning into a tradition - on the last day of work before Christmas, we invite all our friends round (not family) for drinks and finger food. We put the Christmas music on, and spend the last evening before everything goes mad trying to relax. We also did a lucky dip sack full presents for our friends to choose from - well, three sacks really - one for children, one for the women, and one for the men. We've done that for several years too, and it's always great to see just how pleased people are with the simplest things (the star last night was our Australian friend who got a pocket pen knife with a torch on it - he was SO excited about it...).

The one casualty of the evening was my old Playstation 2 - while firing it up for some of the children to play on in the front room, it refused to read any disks. I took an executive decision this morning and bought a new Playstation 2. The upside is that they now cost a third of what they did when I bought the old one, and I got a game thrown in for free - "Lego Star Wars 2". W is playing it right now, and laughing like a child.

I now have to run to the store to buy a few bits and bobs that we completely forgot (tea bags!), and then we can start to relax.

Hope you and yours are getting into the spirit of it all, and I promise to put pictures of the general lunacy up on the blog soon!

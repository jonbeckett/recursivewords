We just spent Sunday afternoon and evening with my cousin Charlotte, and her boyfriend Jake...

Charlotte is from San Francisco, but is living in England at the moment while studying at Kingston University. Charlotte and Jake got their first place together recently, so we went to visit (it was both their birthday's recently) and had dinner with Jake and his family. I have never met such a great group of people - we laughed, drank, laughed some more, drank some more, and basically had a wonderful time.

There is a saying about good wine and good company, isn't there?

Anyway - we are both knackered now, but what a great way to spend a Sunday...

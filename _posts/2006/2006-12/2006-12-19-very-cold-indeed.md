It has been very cold indeed today - below freezing for most of the day. Cycling in this morning I had to stop after about a mile, put my helmet in my bag, and resort to a thick double-skinned fleece hat (pulled down over my ears to avoid them snapping off). When I arrived at the offices I met a couple of colleagues walking from the car park - they looked at me wide eyed, and informed me that a layer of frost had formed across my hat and shoulders.

I had figured my legs were cold during the last mile of the journey - wearing only jeans my thighs (despite being wrapped in a pretty thick sheet of muscle, which was working to turn the pedals) were slowly going numb. If the weather stays like this I will have to resort to thermals.

The cold this morning was the unpleasant kind of cold - that no matter how many layers you put on it dropped your core body temperature. The kind of cold that takes a while to recover from.

The worst thought is that I have to travel home through it again tonight.

As Christmas's go, this one was pretty good (apart from one thing that I will get to in a minute).

We got up at about 8, had breakfast, prepared vegetables, and put dinner on - then opened the mountain of presents sitting in the corner of the lounge. It was great to see W open her presents from me - lots of small things this year instead of one or two big things; definitely more fun to give and receive. I got all sorts of cool stuff - books, DVDs, geeky t-shirts, and a wonderful board game called "Thud" that I have lost spectacularly at so far.

The one thing that has marred the day so far was W's brother deciding he'd had enough in the evening, and going home. I can understand that he was probably bored "doing the family thing", but it did seem incredibly selfish (and caused a few tears).

Anyway. I'm not going to let it get to me too - there are far more important things to worry about. W to be helped, the house to be kept (sort of) tidy, books to be read, DVDs to be watched, new clothes to be worn, friends to thank for presents, food to be eaten, drink to be drunk, and hangovers to be had...

Merry Christmas to you and yours. Here's hoping that your day went off peacefully and uneventfully. I promise to write a proper blog entry when I have more time.

(p.s. W bought me "The God Delusion" - it's fantastic)

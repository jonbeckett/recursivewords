We watched the movie "Good Night and Good Luck" last night.

I'm not sure what I expected of it, but it didn't seem like a "movie" - more like a television drama. For those who have not seen it, "Good Night and Good Luck" chronicles the CBS news team's dismantling of Senator McCarthy in the late 1950s amid the madness of the McCarthy trials. At a time when the US industrial military complex tentacles extended into most of the broadcast media, the CBS team dared to speak out against the madness.

While watching it, both myself and W remarked that if McCarthy had not been stopped, the military could very well have ended up in control of America (some people will argue that they already were in control, and always have been). The whole thing reminded me of the speech made by Donald Sutherland in the directors cut of JFK - about the business of government being war.

One of the best moments of the movie (for me) - and this gives a pretty good indicator of me "as a person" - was a back story in "Good Night and Good Luck". In the 1950s, CBS had a policy that no employees were allowed to be in a relationship with each other. Two of the news team were (they thought) secretly married. As the government turned up the pressure on the company following their news-casts, the couple were asked in to meet the public relations manager. "I know you're married. Everybody knows..." - he then went on to explain that they were needing to lose two people from the team due to budgetary concerns - and would they like to leave, or be pushed.

You would think - in the situation of losing your job - that they would have been distraught. They were not. Their sense of relief was palpable. Both myself and W turned to each other and smiled.

It was a good movie, but it wasn't "great". I'm not sure what was missing either...

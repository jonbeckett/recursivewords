Has anybody seen W? I used to be married to this lady who knitted things, and wrote in her knitting blog. Now I live with this person who enthusiastically recounts stories of dressing Chewbacca up as a Storm Trooper, and how she "got Lando Calrissian to kiss Princess Leia", and other such tales of daring do.

It's all my fault. Curse my metal body (yes, the jokes have gone way below the geek level of most people). I bought Lego Star Wars 2 with the replacement Playstation last weekend. All I hear from the lounge is lazer battles, explosions, and the swoosh of lightsabers (along with the obligatory symphony orchestra belting out the Star Wars theme music).

If I had a time machine, I would go and grab George Lucas from the late 1970's, drag him to my house this evening, and shout "DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'VE DONE!" (in a slightly mad Jim Carey manner).

I haven't been drinking cider, honest.

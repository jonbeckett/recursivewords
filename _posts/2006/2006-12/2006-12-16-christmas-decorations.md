Today was spent on a madcap dash into town for presents, to the supermarket for christmas meal ingredients, and to the garden center for a Christmas Tree and decorations. Following that I climbed into the attic and retrieved the various bits and bobs we have collected over our years together.

The following photos are stored at their original size over at Flickr - feel free to click on any of them and have a better nose at bigger versions.

Voodoo Snowman

We received this from my parents a couple of years ago for Christmas - it's made of wicker and has fairy lights inside it. I think it's posessed by something evil, but W loves it.

Alcoholic Snowman

I saw this today while buying decorations (I was given permission to buy whatever I wanted - wehey!). I saw his face, and thought "I've got to have him"...

The Lounge

About half way through putting stuff up, I took a picture of the lounge. I still have W's presents to wrap.

The Lounge (again)

Looking the other way across the lounge...

Simpson's New Bed

While busy untangling things, and pinning things to other things, Simpson discovered a wonderful new bed in the kitchen.

Buzz, Woody and Jessie

The Christmas spirit seems to have permeated the bookshelves - Buzz, Woody and Jessie are caught having an intimate moment. Looks like Woody is about to get a slap though...

W Cooking

W preparing to make "Mushroom Wellington", which will be frozen off, and retrieved on Christmas Day.

Last Year's Wreath

While unpacking the various boxes of decorations, we discovered last year's wreath (in several pieces).

Tangled Lights

You would not believe how long it took to untangle them...

Decorations

Why does something that seems so gaudy throughout the rest of the year seem like a good idea at Christmas time ?

It's very rare that I run a story across both the PluggedOut blog and here at LifeAndTimes, but I felt today was one of those rare times...

Yes - that's right. Time Magazine has named you as the "Person of the Year"...

That's right - you. You are the "Person of the Year". By taking part in, and therefore making up a small part of the whole that we call "the internet", Time Magazine has marked you out as the most significant thing to have happened in 2006. The buzz words within the covering article seem to center around the same terms that surround "Web 2.0" - community and collaboration.

In reality of course, we are talking about Wikipedia, Digg, MySpace, and YouTube - among many others. Perhaps the most satisfying result of taking part in any of the collaborative communities on the internet is that the mass media hate you. You are out of their control. You are free - you cannot be dictated to.

Well done on the award. You've earned it. We all have.

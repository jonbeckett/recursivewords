Today is the last day of work before Christmas. The office has reduced down to a skeleton staff, of which I am one.

The above photo shows the view from the end window of the office this morning. Freezing fog has been sitting on the UK for several days now - although in Marlow this morning it seems to have cleared - for the first time all week we can see the sky (visibility has been down to 50 feet or so at times). Most of the internal UK flights have been grounded for the last few days due to the fog, causing havoc at the major airports.

I don't get why people are moaning at the airports - there is absolutely nothing anybody can do about it.

In other news, I am going down with a cold - but not if I can help it. Here's the various things I have on my desk to combat it;

We have lucozade, special "christmas biscuits" made by W, a bar of Galaxy chocolate, echinacea tablets, nurofen tablets, satsuma oranges, an apple, and sandwiches. I've already take the tablets and had a glass of lucozade - hopefully they will kick in and annihilate the germs that are trying to get at me.

If you're around today, give me a shout - it's very quiet in the office, and I could do with the company.

I am busy perusing the Figleaves website, trying to pick something for my better half for Christmas. Why is it so difficult?

Do you get something sensible, or something special? Do you get something you like, or something you think she will like? Do you get white, black or some other colour? Plain or patterned? Big name or little known brand? Sexy or comfy? (can underwear be both provocative and comfortable?)

I will admit to being a little lost.

The ladies that stumble upon this post will be amused by my encounter with our local lingerie shop last year. I wandered in, and they were taken aback that I knew my other half's exact sizes. Apparently this is rare, and all kinds of comical scenes ensue with gentlemen trying to indicate the relative size of their spouses... I wonder if they do it on purpose to strike up conversation with attractive assistants? It wouldn't surprise me.

I have heard several quotes over the years warning against the dangers of mediocrity. How best to battle the slide of this blog over the past several days towards that danger?

How about a geeky post? Something of interest to others rather than something introspective? I have to be careful when it comes to "geek posts", because I could keep prattling on about "interesting stuff I have found" until the end of the known universe. That's why I also write a blog at PluggedOut covering just the geek-o-sphere...

Anyway - this "thing" I'm thinking of (which is particularly "thingish" as Pooh Bear might have remarked), was too good not to mention.

I have discovered a rather nice little service on the web called "Twitter". The basic idea is you can join up - as can your friends (for free), and it works like a mini-blog. You can text message whatever you are up to, to twitter, and it appears on twitter instantly. You can have it so your friends are informed what you wrote too. It not only supports text messaging, but IM applications too (Google Talk etc). You can also show the most recent twitter post from you via your webpage...

You will notice (if you visit the homepage of this blog at www.pluggedout.com/lifeandtimes) that there is a twitter thingy in the margin. Feel free to join twitter and request me (jonbeckett73) as a friend!

We arrived in Talland at about 5pm last night, after a day spent on the road battling driving rain and howling winds. It was great to finally arrive, sit in front of a roaring fire with my parents, and have dinner.

Today is rapidly dissappearing after getting up late, and we are deliberately trying to "slow down" to the cornish way of life. Time doesn't seem to be in such a rush in Cornwall - people don't rush, or get angry if things don't happen instantly. There is a real sense that nothing is really that important - unlike London, where everybody seems to be selfish, self centred and self absorbed.

After all getting up late this morning, bacon is sizzling in the kitchen, the kettle is whistling on the Arga, and I've just fetched a new bucket of coal in. We have no real plans for the day, other than relaxing, eating, drinking, and maybe some board games.

Perfect.

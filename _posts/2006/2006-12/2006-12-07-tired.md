Another day, another journey into the depths of London's East End. A little further through Anna Karenina, and a little less energy left in the tank.

At lunchtime I walked through Spitalfields market. Among the polished glass frontages of modern retailers, a few traditional market stalls still exist - selling everything from woolly hats to paintings, to bits of bicycle. While wandering along, I wished I had taken my camera. There's always tomorrow.

After a rather intense afternoon of programming, I finally got on the train at just gone 6pm, arriving home at about 8pm. Bang went any hope of going out running with W this evening. By the time we had eaten it was nearly 10.

Oh dear... I have just spent the last hour watching "Love Actually" over the top of the laptop screen. I got sucked in. I found myself watching the credits with tears on my cheeks. Aren't feel good movies brilliant?

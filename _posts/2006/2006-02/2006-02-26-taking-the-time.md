I'm sat here wondering about time - five minutes to be more precise. I've never really thought too deeply about how I spend my time each day before - I tend to just muddle my way through between one day and the next, and behave like some kind of automaton. Get up, go to work, do what I'm told, come home, do what's expected, kick back for a while, go to bed.

Somewhere in that monotonous routine of course is the time I spend with my wonderfully lovely other half, and the time I spend catching up with various friends and family on the internet. I also spend inordinate amounts of time "surfing" the internet, satisfying my mind's seemingly ravenous appetite for new knowledge. What can I say - I appear to have an enquiring mind.

The internet seems to be invading my life like some kind of tentacled parasite. It has snuck in behind everything else and become an essential ingredient that other interactions rely on. Without it I would lose touch with some very important friends that keep me rather more sane that I would be without them waking up around the world and spending five minutes with me.

Spending five minutes. It's funny, isn't it - how few people are willing to give five minutes of their time to other people any more. When was the last time you actually asked somebody "how are you?", and were ready to really listen while they didn't just say "fine"...

On another note, please excuse me while I go and stamp on the wireless router in the other room which keeps cutting out the signal to me. On another side note, I definitely need to do some anger management - while playing X-Box earlier I very nearly leaped upon the laptop that happened to be nearby - just because some imaginary twerp in a racing car game punted me of the track.

Where was I?

Time. Yes. Without embarassing anybody I just want to thank two particular people who I tend to spend five minutes with most days through the wonder of the internet. I look forward to our brief conversations over coffee, sat several thousand miles apart putting the world to rights, and passing judgement on each other's worries and escapades.

If you spent a couple of minutes reading this, I hope I made some kind of point somewhere - just don't ask me what I was trying to say. I guess I might have been saying that if you have the odd five minutes to spend, I would be a more than willing recipient

It's Saturday morning, I've been up since 8am, and I feel great - which is surprising as I was off work yesterday feeling very rough indeed.

It looks tremendously horrible outside. There's two adjectives you don't see together very often - "tremendously horrible". I'm going to be sat here thinking up other unlikely pairs now - "hideously fantastic"... oh dear, this could become the kind of all procrastinatory diversions. One famous combination comes to mind - "Magnificent Desolation" - I believe it was coined by Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin during his first moon walk.

I am conscious that I haven't been writing in my blog very often recently. The truth is I haven't really had much to report - my life has been even more uneventful than usual. Get up, go to work, come home, watch telly, go to bed. Repeat. The failure of the IVF has probably had something to do with it - not wanting to really communicate with the outside world too much. It's easy to just bury myself in my work - which is probably why PluggedOut Writers got created.

Ooh - on about websites, I found something of note last night - The Internet Scrabble Club. If you have ever played chess on the Free Internet Chess Server, you will instantly recognise many facets of the interface - it appears they have ported the guts of it to play Scrabble instead of Chess - and they have a nice Java client called WordBiz that makes the actual playing of games, and finding of players very easy indeed. I showed it to W last night and she has been addicted ever since. Like the chess servers, the service keeps track of your rating from game to game, and you can look back over other player's previous games to see how they play. My only fear now is that W will become an expert at all the two and three letter words - which will mean the end of any chance of me ever beating her at Scrabble again.

I'm probably going to spend today working on the writing website, or playing computer games  I'm in the middle of a world championships in a cheap Formula One game

I bought the other weekend (Formula One 2005 for the PS2). It has a "career" mode in it - I won a drive with one of the crap teams, and have been doing some giant killing.

Thinking about Formula One, the season is nearly upon us once more. I've been reading the various news reports from ITV-F1, and it would appear the championships are going to be very close this year. McLaren seem to have the fastest, but also the most fragile car. Honda and Renault are very, very close to them in terms of outright pace, followed by Ferrari and the rest. It's going to be an interesting year.

Changing subject yet again (how many subjects can I write about in one blog?), is it just me or has the Winter Olympics become a bit boring? The press are doing their best to make stories up about people like Bodie Miller, and the various "alleged" drugs offences with the biathletes - instead of reporting on all the good things that are happening (like a girl from a tiny village in the UK winning silver in the tea-tray - sorry, Skeleton Bob).

Anyway - I'm off to have some Saturday  I'll do the rounds of the blogs I track with BlogLines later and try to catch up with everybody - promise!

I think I might be experiencing what some people call "burnout".

Two nights ago I decided to start building a successor to the writing site I ran one upon a time - "ThoughtCafe"... I'm getting there slowly, but it's really taking it out of me. You can go and have a look at my main development site - for the moment, the new site resides at PluggedOut Writers.

It hasn't helped that the last few days at work have been pretty much flat out too - today I spent all day reading technical stuff about Apache and PHP to help diagnose a problem a client is having. Thankfully I already know quite a lot about them, but still - spending 18 hours a day coding probably isn't healthy.

I'm off to go spend some time with my lovely wife now...

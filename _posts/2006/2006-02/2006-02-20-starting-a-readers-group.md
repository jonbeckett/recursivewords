You heard it here first.

I've started a reading group on Yahoo, which W is graciously going to help me run (I say "run" in perhaps the most creative sense, as the group will in all likelihood be a free-for-all).

The basic idea will be to vote for books to read a month ahead, then when everybody has read them we can all get together and either say "well wasn't that a wonderful book", or "well wasn't that a waste of time"... the general idea is to read some great books, make some great friends, and have a great time.

If you love books and are looking for an excuse to force you to read more than you presently do, click on the link below and request membership...

Yes, you heard right. I am English, and I think Soccer is the most pathetic game in the world - or at least the people who play it at the top level are the most pathetic people in the world.

I was just watching the "hilights" of Liverpool's match with Chelsea today, and almost laughed out loud. The Liverpool goalkeeper did a fantastic tackle to take the ball from one of the Chelsea players, and was reprimanded for it after the Chelsea player fell over like he'd been run over by a tractor.

The referee summoned the goalkeeper over to talk to him, and on the way one of the opposition players walked up to the keeper to hurl some abuse at him. The keeper put his hand against the other guys face and pushed him away. The guy he pushed (a fully grown man) suddenly grasped his face in his hands, screamed, and fell to the ground... and the goalkeeper got sent off.

Can you believe it?

Not only are soccer players pathetic, the people in charge of the game make decisions based on their pathetic carryings on.

Now I know why I prefer Rugby over soccer.

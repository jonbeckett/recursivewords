For the first time in living memory, I am choosing to stay at home today rather than trudge off across the country to visit W's family (or go on some other escapade that uses up my entire day off). I just want to have Sunday to myself for a change. Of course now I'll feel guilty for not going.

Therefore I now have the afternoon to myself - I can catch up with everybody else's blogs and write comments galore.

By the wonders of internet radio, I can listen to yesterday's Jonathan Ross radio show on the BBC website (click here to listen to it - you need Realplayer installed). Jonathan Ross is by far the most entertaining radio show I have ever listened to. It's right up there with "QI" - a UK television program you could loosely call a "game show". I've just had a quick look on the net, and they've actually made a QI website. There is a fantastic trailer for the show.

If anybody is online today, feel free to email me or contact me via my new favourite program - Google Talk.

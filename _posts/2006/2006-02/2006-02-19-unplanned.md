This weekend didn't happen how I thought it was going to happen at all.

Rather than spend the entire weekend kicking back, I found myself decorating. It was one of those "I'm not doing anything else, so why can't I be doing something W wants me to be doing" weekends. Saying that, we did get a lot done. I wallpapered the upstairs landing with lining paper yesterday, and painted the whole area with flat white paint today. Hopefully that means we can paint a top coat on in the evenings this week.

Apart from that, we went over to PC world yesterday afternoon and I bought W a new laptop. The screen on hers is flapping around like a sail with no wind recently, making it incredibly difficult to use. We got a no-name 1.5Ghz XP laptop with 512Mb RAM on board - it's perfectly fine for what she uses it for, and it has wireless built in.

This means that I have inherited the laptop with the dodgy screen. It's much better than the "craptop" that I have been using, but it has this screen problem. At the moment I'm propping one of those L-shaped book ends under the laptop to keep the screen upright - but that only works if you sit it on a table. As soon as we have verified that all W's data is migrated from it, I'm going to format it and re-install everything cleanly once more. It's had a couple of years of rubbish being installed and removed from it.

The only other thing I got from PC World yesterday was a new (decent) webcam. I have previously spent about 12 on webcams - which end up being predictably crap. I finally spent the money on a nice Logitech webcam, and have been suitably amazed at it's quality - especially in low light conditions. Here's a sample...

On another note, I've just been watching the US Hockey Team getting their ass handed to them by Sweden in the Winter Olympics. I will admit to almost smiling - I'm one of those people who gets really annoyed when the US have competitions that they call the "World Series", when in reality it's only a national championships. Hopefully getting walloped at everything they think they are good at will help them realise that they are only one country in a very big world... and they're not even the biggest country. At the moment they probably do win the "in the most debt" competition though.

Enough serious thoughts. It's Sunday night and I don't want the weekend to end.

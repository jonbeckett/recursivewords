It's been a great Saturday so far. It's cold outside, but not unpleasantly so. A crunchy cold.

We just got back from walking into town. We live about a mile from the centre of Marlow, and hardly ever drive in - by the time you have got in the car, driven in, parked, and walked to wherever you were going, you could have walked there. Walking does you good, it's less stressful than driving, and it doesn't cost anything either.

I bought a new penit will take a few months to become really smooth. Some people seem to advocate writing on sandpaper to get them smooth quickly - that seems a bit extreme to me.

There's something strangely romantic or eccentric about owning and using a fountain pen. I like that feeling.

The pen can join the other bits and pieces I carry around with me all the time (wallet, phone, keys, and palm organiser). It's probably worth mentioning that my keys have a penknife attached to them with a USB flash drive built into it - go look at the Victorinox site to see what I mean. When I got it for Christmas a couple of years ago I wondered if I would use it much, but it's turned out to be one of the most useful things I've ever owned. Once you have a penknife and other people find out, they're forever asking to borrow it too, which is a little annoying. Feels good to be helpful though.

I have absolutely no plans for the rest of the afternoon (or the weekend), so I'll see where it takes me. I expect more blog entries may be written at some point.

Ooh - nearly forgot - everybody needs to install Google Talk. I've been playing with it, and it's simpler than both Skype, Yahoo Messenger, and MSN. What's more, it's a Google product, and that scares the hell out of Microsoft. I am "jonathan.beckett@gmail.com" on Google Talk - if you need an invitation to get your GMail account, just email me or comment on this and I'll send the invite. Remember to tell me your email address so I can send the invite (the reason for this is GMail is invite only - I was a very early adopter).

It might interest whoever reads this to also learn that Google have built Google Talk into GMail too - so you don't even need Google Talk running if you are looking at the GMail webpage - it all works right there in the webpage... very clever.

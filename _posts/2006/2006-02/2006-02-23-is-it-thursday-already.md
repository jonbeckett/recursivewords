I can't believe it's Thursday. This week is dissappearing faster than a fast thing that dissappears quickly.

Okay. I'll stop the "Blackadder" style remarks.

I'm back on Support at work, which means I have time to write in my blog during the day once more. My blog has been sadly neglected for the last few days so it's probably high time that I splurged some thoughts into it.

First thought that comes to mind is the Microsoft advert I saw on television last night. They had one of those adverts where you spend the first three quarters of it trying to figure out (a) what the advert is about, and (b) who the hell the company is going to be. I think the main point they were trying to get across is that the next version of all the Microsoft products coming out will be much more secure.

So what Microsoft are neglecting to say is "more secure than what?" - the answer to which of course is "our own products". It's a little like Ford running an advertising campaign saying "Buy the new Ford (because you're driving a f*cking deathtrap)".

I know, I know, all companies do the same kind of advertising. I just like to pick on Microsoft. It's fun. We all know that Windows XP is nearly the best desktop operating system available (that crown goes to Apple's OS-X). I do get annoyed with companies who keep buying Windows as a server operating system though - it's emphatically NOT the best choice by any stretch of the imagination. The various flavours of Linux wipe the floor with it.

Changing subject wildly, the new edition of Empire magazine arrived today - by far the best movie magazine in production. It's arrival has prompted myself and W to go to the cinema tonight if we don't have too crap a day - we'll probably go see "Good Night, and Good Luck", the new(ish) George Clooney movie. W also wants to go see the gay cowboy movie but I'm not too keen (Brokeback Mountain, for those of you who have been living in a hole in the ground).

Going to the cinema means we'll be eating out tonight - yay! Pizza Hut! I'm looking forward to that feeling of having eaten too much already.

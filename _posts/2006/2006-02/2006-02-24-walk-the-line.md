We just got back from watching the movie "Walk the Line". We decided to see it at the last moment when we arrived at the cinema - we had been thinking of going to see "Goodnight, and Good Luck".

I'm stuck for a description or sensible superlative to describe it. It's by far the best movie I've seen in a long time. I don't really get into the technicalities of movies - I just tend to turn up and enjoy... and I did.

Even though it's not really fashionable any more, I've always had a bit of a soft spot for Johnny Cash's music, and this movie filled in a lot of the back story behind a lot of the famous tracks. I had seen a documentary on television a while ago that covered Cash's last years, and the recording of "Hurt" - it's a shame in a way that the movie didn't close with it... I guess they didn't want to completely tear the audience to shreds though.

I'm finding it hard to describe why the movie was good. It just was. It got under your skin. You ended up caring about Johnny and June - even if you knew that the movie wasn't telling the whole truth.

Perhaps I'll be able to enthuse a little more clearly tomorrow...

Yes, yes, I know - I haven't written anything in here for a few days and you're wondering where I've dissappeared off to. I've not been keeping up with the blogs I normally read either. Yes... yes... I'm very naughty. Blah blah blah.

Sorry - I'm just in a good mood today, and spouting garbage. I tend to do that sometimes.

At work yesterday we got the news through that the project I have been doing the conceptual work on, and will eventually be the "Technical Lead" on has been won by our company. It's nice to wander around the building and find handshakes greeting me wherever I seem to go. I'll shut up about it now though - I don't want to get into trouble for talking about work if the HR manager ever reads this.

Yesterday was also "Valentines Day" in the UK. It's pretty stupid really - single people are supposed to make an extra effort on Valentines Day to woo the object of their affections. Why they can't make that effort all the time is anybodies guess. Even though I'm now happily married, I will admit to buying W flowers, chocolates and a card to cheer her up a bit. I also cooked dinner, and we spent the evening watching silly movies ("The Wedding Singer", and "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"). We managed to get through a bottle of Champagne - leftover from christmas - and a bottle of wine last night. I thought I might wake up with a headache this morning, but was fine.

Today has been another busy one at work. I went on site this morning, and am now having my first "break" of the day - at 4:30pm. I'll probably pack up in a minute and leave early... I didn't really stop at lunchtime anyway.

I need something arcane to write a blog entry about... maybe I'll write a geeky series of blogs about the history of computing or the internet - because I know all about it without having to even look it up

It seems like days since I last posted a "proper" entry into my blog, so here is one. I'm not sure quite what I'm going to write about at this point, so we'll just see where it takes us.

I'm writing the text in Microsoft Word 97 on an old Toshiba laptop (the somewhat famousin our house"craptop"). I would be highly surprised if anybody who reads my blog has a worse computer. It's so bad that I prefer using the Opera web browser on it because it's that bit quicker than Firefox. Normally this would be fine, but Opera isn't quite as compatible as Firefox with some web pages. Putting my geek head on, Opera seems to have problems with particular types of floating div tags.

I often wonder while writing in my blog about the use of hyphens and brackets. My style of blogging tends to be very conversational, and in line with that I tend to wander off mid sentence to interject the odd fact or point of interest. I'm aware that in the past I have used brackets far too much, so am making a definite effort at the moment to not use them if I can help it. I'm sure you didn't really need to read all about that, but it was in my head so I wrote it. Yes, I really am this simple.

So what have I been up to recently?

My day at work today was filled with HTML, and content management systems. I am implementing my own CMS as a replacement for the company website where I work. It's great fun (how geeky does that sound?), and makes the hours fly by during the day. I am getting a little worried thoughI'm sure I can probably write pure HTML more quickly than a designer could do the same thing in Dreamweaver. I'll be thinking in HTML soon.

One element of the website that has wound me up is the content. I was under the impression that other people had been working on content for the last few months, but when I finally receive the results of their work I find my own original text cut and pasted into their documents it looks like nobody has lifted a finger. I've taken it upon myself to start authoring the site myselfand I'll take full credit when it's done.

Away from work, things have been busy too. Today I got up a little earlier than normal and found time to eat some cerealsthen when I got in this evening I managed to get the washing up done, put a load of washing in, fold up last night's washing and put dinner on before W got inwhich was great because it meant she could relax when she arrived. The IVF drugs are still taking it out of hershe gets tired very easily, so if I can help in little ways I will do so.

It's getting pretty late here so I should think about signing off. This is probably the first "brain dump" blog entry I've done in ages. I have no idea if this bilge is interesting to anybody, but it's probably helping my poor old brain to purge some of it

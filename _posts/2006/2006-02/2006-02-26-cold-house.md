Our heating has packed up. Again.

The gas boiler will not stay lit - therefore we have the various electric heaters on around the house. It doesn't help that it's below zero outside - god knows what the electricity bill is going to be.

We spent yesterday and today carrying on with the decorating upstairs; I painted the walls while W did the woodwork. Today's task was masking and undercoating an old iron window. Once it has a couple of layers of gloss on it the masking can come off, and hopefully it will look okay once more.

We've uncovered more horrors of the lazy-ass people who lived here before - like wallpapering straight over rawplugs that protrude from the wall (how difficult could it really have been to just hook them out of the wall and squirt some filler in?). Nothing surprises us any more.

I'm now sat here wondering what to do with my Sunday evening. Food, wine and laziness looks quite appealing at the moment. I expect the laptop will be somewhere nearby, so if you're bored too give me a shout.

It came as no surprise that following Rossi's 10th place in Assen, he is whining about the MotoGP races being so close together. If he had been in the lead of the championships he doubtless would have kept very quiet indeed.

Last weekend confirmed everything I ever want to know about the snivelling little shit that is "Rossi". Following a huge accident at the first corner of the spanish GP at Catalunya, 5 of the top 6 riders in the championship were knocked out of the race with either injuries or broken machinery. Rossi therefore lucked in, and trundled around for the win - which was fine. What wasn't fine is that he then celebrated in such an arrogant fashion - holding a finger up to the crowd to signify his "number one" status... I turned the television off and found something else to do.

It's becoming more and more clear - the people who "support" Rossi are on about the same level as people who "support" Manchester United, or Ferrari. You can infer whatever you want to.

I have been working on a project for work all weekend (complex programming geekery), and am finding it difficult to get it out of my head.

I just walked into town to go and get something to eat for dinner, and found myself thinking about classes, methods, and other such programming geekery for much of the time.

I'm now sat here with my third glass of wine since I switched off Visual Studio, and know that I still have some stuff to arrange for tomorrow - a 6am start to go into London and visit a client.

Perhaps it's good that I'm going on holiday on Wednesday. Forced break. I need it.

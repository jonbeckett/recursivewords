When I got home from work last night there was a parcel at the back door, and even though it had my name on it, I thought W must have bought something on E-Bay, and thought no more of it.

When W got home, she said "that's parcel is a present for you..."

So - I get the scissors out and start cutting into the cardboard, and in the mass of bubblewrap, I discover a NES 

I can't actually remember what games I used to have. I know I had Duck Hunt, and Gyromite (with the robot), but I also had some latter day classics - things like Excite Bike and RC Pro Am - and Super Mario Brothers of course.

I can still remember the cult that was "Super Mario Brothers". Kids at school used to take a pride in knowing more secrets about the game than each other, or how fast they could complete a particular level.

What fun I'm going to have over the coming days. The NES brings my museum of old games machines one step closer to completion - there are very few machines (that were available in europe) that I don't have now... and all of it has been bought relatively cheaply on E-Bay.

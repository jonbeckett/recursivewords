Okay - Jim survived and is okay - he's still in hospital while they figure out why his heart stopped, but he's sat up, is talking to people and is otherwise fine.

His wife is staying with my parents, and (as I overheard while she used their phone earlier) she plans on staying with them for a while.

Bang goes our holiday right there.

I know it's terrible to have this point of view, but if nothing changes by the end of the weekend, myself and W are probably going home. Bang goes several weeks of doing extra work at home and at weekends, and bang goes any chance of any holiday until September.

All I have to look forward to now are weeks, and weeks, and weeks of overtime and working weekends that I agreed to in order to have this holiday - only of course the holiday hasn't happened.

As you can imagine, I'm not happy.

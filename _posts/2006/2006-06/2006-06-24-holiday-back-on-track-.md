This morning myself and W went for a walk around Polruan - both to get away from everybody, and to salvage at least something from the holiday.

We did the short coastal walk - about 5 miles - and added various detours onto it - one of which took us on a nature trail through various coppiced woodlands alongside the river Fowey. We were warned by my parents before setting out that it was a hard route with some big hills - for some reason it goes into one of their ears and out the other that W regularly walks half marathons, and that I cycle miles every day, and have run quite a few medium distance races recently... It goes without saying that their "big hills" were not steep or long at all.

Anyway - we now find ourselves back at the house once more, and have just had a phone call from the hospital. Dad was calling to tell us that we are setting out on the boat tomorrow at 6am (i.e. as early as sensibly possible). I'm not sure how he's wangled that yet, but I'm sure we'll find out later. If there's some wind tomorrow and we get good conditions it might just still be on to reach the Scilly Islands.

I'm now keeping my fingers crossed.

I just took an IQ test at the Tickle website, and have no idea what the results mean. Apparently unless you pay, they give you an abridged version of the score.

Your IQ score is 131is 131? Is that good? I really have no idea, because I don't usually think these tests have any kind of value in "real life".

What do you think?

After my apparent "success" with the IQ test the other day, I sat down late last night and did a free exam on the Brain Bench website.

I sat the "English Vocabulary" exam, and said I should have an "advanced" understanding (being English). The exam took me about 45 minutes, and was incredibly difficult.

Apparently I scored 3.97 out of 5 - "higher than 86% of all previous test takers".

Demonstrates a clear understanding of many advanced concepts within this topic. Appears capable of mentoring others on most projects in this area.

Weak Areas - None Noted

As with the IQ test I did the other night, I have no idea what relevance tests like this have to the real world, but it was fun doing them. I should probably close in saying that my wife thrashed me on this test - she got 4.3, which apparently qualified her for a "masters" level in English.

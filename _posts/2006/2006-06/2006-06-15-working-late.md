It's now 22:06 and I find myself finishing up on some work that I brought home with me. Maybe time for some television, some quality time with my other half, and then turn in for the night.

This weekend is going to be filled with work. I have my new laptop from work now, so at least have a platform to use from home. The backpack I'm going to be using to transport it is big enough to mistake for a "King of the Rocket Men" backpack though...

For those interested in techie stuff, it's a Dell Inspiron 9400 - it has a dual core processor, and 2 gig of RAM. Beyond that I don't know much about it - other than the fact that it has an absolutely HUGE screen...

I promise to find time to write something interesting soon - honest.

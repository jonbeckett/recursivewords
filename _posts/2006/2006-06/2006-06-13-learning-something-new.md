I am on a course for the first few days this week (or "taking a class" as the American's among you might better understand).

The course is for some more technical geekery - it's for a workflow product called K2 - part of the whole Windows / SharePoint / Office juggernaut that seems to be rolling across the IT landscape at the moment.

So far in the course I've had a huge advantage, because I've seen and used the product before. Hopefully today we will move on to some elements that I know nothing about.

Anyway - I'll try and write something interesting later when I get back.

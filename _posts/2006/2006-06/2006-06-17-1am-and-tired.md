It's 01:00 on Saturday morning, and I have been programming all night. I am relatively pleased though - I now have a complete database wrapper class that I can use in the rest of the code I'm going to be writing this weekend.

The main aim for the weekend is to invent methods to communicate with a big database schema - so I've effectively built the first layer of the foundations so far. Tomorrow will be filled with diagrams, and writing of lots of methods.

Bizarrely, tonight was probably the hardest bit - because now I have the database programming done, the rest should follow relatively easily.

I'll write more through the weekend. It's worth pointing out that I am going to be only pretty much all weekend as I work on this stuff, so feel free to message me and annoy me  (jonbeckett73 on Yahoo Messenger)

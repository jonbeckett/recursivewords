Nobody will be interested in this post apart from the geeks among you. Actually, it's a bit of a misnomer addressing an "audience" to this blog - as far as I know, only two or three people read it. I shall carry on anyway...

I hereby title myself "King of the Idiots". I updated the programming behind this webpage a couple of days ago to bring it "up to date" with the latest development version - and in the process wiped out the "theme" - the "look and feel" of the site.

If you had noticed the cartoon appear at the top of the page, this was the real reason behind it - I lost what used to be there... I put most of the stuff back in place immediately after, but only realised this morning while checking something else that I had missed the various affiliate links - such as the link to StatCounter and Blog Explosion. The most serious omission is StatCounter - it means I have no idea how many people looked at the Blog yesterday (not that I ever remember to look at it anyway).

I told you this entry was going to be geeky, didn't I.

I do wonder how many people actually read the rubbish I write though...

We have just been watching "Celebrity Weakest Link" on the television, and laughing our socks off at the lack of knowledge they seem to have.

I'm not sure where they dredged the collection of so-called celebrities from - they were at best Z-list celebs - those who are known for being things like astrologers, or participants in reality television shows...

Here is a selection of the questions and their answers...

Q. What is the common name of a meteorite - a falling what ?

A. Comet

Q. What is the second letter of the word Aardvark ?

A. R

Q. Is Michael Stipe famously a vegatarian, or a rastafarian ?

A. A rastafarian

Q. What's ten plus sixteen ?

A. 160

Can you believe those answers? We couldn't. The scary thing is, kids look up to these people...

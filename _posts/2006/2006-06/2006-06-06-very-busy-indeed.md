I'm just taking the chance (while waiting for some software to install) to write a few words in my blog.

A new project has started at work that is going to take up inordinate amounts of my free time - so my blog will probably suffer, as will the various online friendships I have. I promise to try and email people at least once a week, but if not you can always check in the blog what I'm up to.

Today's task is building a development environment for us developers to use in order to build the new system for the client. We use virtualisation software called "VMWare", meaning that we can run "pretend" computers inside our normal machines. It's quick, it's cheap, and it's a great way to get things done.

Better get on with it...

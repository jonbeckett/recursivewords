We are finally escaping from our life tomorrow, and spending a week holed up in a cabin in the Turkish mountains (click here for a sneaky peek). This of course begs the question - which books do I take away on holiday with me?

I bought several classics a while ago - including such weighty tomes as "War and Peace", and "The Idiot". A little voice in my head tells me that I should pick lightweight reading for a holiday - maybe one of the Discworld books, or some Dickens. Maybe even "The Pandora Star", which I bought W quite some time ago.

Another voice in my head tells me I should take the chance to read something of substance. Years ago I tried to read Moby Dick, and gave up pretty quickly. It has become a thorn in my side now - I want to read it, but know it's a difficult book to get into. Perhaps I'll try again.

Does anybody have any thoughts, or suggestions of books they have read recently?

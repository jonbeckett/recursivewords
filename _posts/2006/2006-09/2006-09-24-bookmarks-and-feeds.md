For the first time since last weekend I have what appears to be a Sunday to myself. I'm probably going to fill it with all manner of activities that are on the "would like to do when I have time" list - like creating a good set of bookmarks of the pages I visit regularly, or a good OPML file containing all the feeds that I regularly peruse.

I also have some tidying up to do around the house, but that's not really going to take very long.

btw - if anybody is using Google Talk (jonathan.beckett), Yahoo Messenger (jonbeckett73), MSN Messenger (jonbeckett73), or Skype (jonbeckett73) feel free to hit me up!

Coffee... I need coffee.

Today was the kind that you remember with a smile.

One of our good friends was 40 years old this week, and we celebrated with a small group of friends and family this Sunday over lunch at a country hotel in the English countryside.

There is something special about the England you find away from the towns and cities. It may be that it's the "real" England - written about by Betjeman and Keats. The hotel and it's grounds today reminded us all of a more quiet way of life - of the value of spending time with friends, and of sharing each other's company.

Wonderful people. Wonderful day.

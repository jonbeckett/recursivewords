I just played Chess on the internet for the first time in ages, and got resoundingly thrashed twice in a row. It may have had something to do with the glass of wine I just drank, but I'm not so sure.

I used to play chess a lot - I've read books about it, and studied the history of the game (there are some fantastic stories of people going off the rails). I've always been fascinated with it - maybe because it's something I'm never going to master. I bore of things that "I can do".

Playing chess well requires hard work, and practice - neither of which I have done for months now. Hell - I haven't played an "over the board" game with anybody for perhaps four months. That's unheard of.

Half the reason for playing chess this evening is a conversation I had with a friend today where I asked for suggestions for "things to do to relax". Chess was one of the activities - as was drawing, or reading.

I'm still half-way through Anna Karenina, and enjoying it. I might go to bed early actually, and read a bit more of it. It's about time I had an early night.

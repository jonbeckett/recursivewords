I forgot to say... while on holiday in Turkey we went out for dinner one evening in nearby Fethiye, and while eating the main course, our host for the evening (the owner of the hotel), suddenly drops this bombshell...

"I discovered your blog on the internet earlier today."

Oh. My. God. That was a first. Somebody I don't really know found my blog. My nerves were calmed slightly by the next words he volunteered (I may have blurted out something like "REALLY!" as the rest of the people around the table - about 10 of them - fell silent).

"It inspired me to create my own blog."

At that point I probably calmed down a bit, and W was preparing to hit me with a large heavy object for talking about anything vaguely connected with computers or the internet while on holiday (supposedly a holiday away from said subjects).

So there you are. We go on holiday to the back end of nowhere, and somebody turns round to me and tells me they found my blog that very morning... small world.

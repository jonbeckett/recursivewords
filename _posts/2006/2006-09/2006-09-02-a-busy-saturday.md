It feels rather strange - entering "normal" life once more after several months working weekends.

Today we went "shopping" for the first time in recent memory. I got my hair cut, bought clothes, PS2 games, and finally bought a DVD recorder for home.

After having it for a few hours, we wish we had bought one a LONG time ago. It has a hard drive on-board that continually records what you're watching - so if you miss something you can re-wind live television... and re-wind that again if required... it's wonderful.

Half the reason I don't watch television any more is because I have so many distractions that I never see a whole episode of anything. Perhaps this new gadget will fix that.

The recorder can burn recorded programs to DVD too - I'm not sure how much we'll ever use that feature (I guess we might for movies), but it's nice to have. I think the machine can record something silly like 30 hours worth at full quality to hard drive anyway...

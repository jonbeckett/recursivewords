For the past couple of days I have been looking at various means of organising my life a little better. I tend to forget where I should be or what I should be doing rather too often.

This "organisation" probably requires no more than some kind of to-do list that I keep on top of, and a calendar.

I used to have a Filofax which worked well as a calendar, but it didn't help in terms of reminding me about anything. Sat on the desk next to me is a Palm organiser. It is probably the best "magic bullet" I have that could help me, but I need to get into a routine of using it, and carrying it with me.

I have also looked at various internet solutions - including BackPack - an online organiser that has to-do lists, pages for you to write, and so on. It all looks very nice, but it costs money and I don't know if I would use it if I paid for it (perhaps that is a motivation in itself though - if you pay for something, are you more likely to use it?).

The Palm Organiser looks like it's going to win the battle, but it very much depends on me using it much more regularly than I do at the moment. I need to put reminders in the calendar. I need to write to-do lists and tick them off. I need to basically "act", and not sit here writing a blog about it.

Of course, I am sitting here writing about the thought of doing something. That's a pretty high level of procrastination, isn't it - writing about the thought of getting off my ass.

Changing subject violently, I did achieve something yesterday that's nearly worth noting... I sorted out my RSS feeds, and added a little doobry to my blog called "Grazr". It lets you persuse the same things that I do. If you go to LifeAndTimes and look in the right margin, you will see a little box with folders in - that's the RSS feeds I follow. Rather clever, no?

Anyway - it's lunchtime and I have a date with a tub of biscuits.

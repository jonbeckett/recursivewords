Over the last few weeks I have been busy re-styling the PluggedOut website, and have started writing regular posts over there on the thing that interests me most - "interesting stuff I find on the internet".

Something has surprised me.

I have been writing regular entries on PluggedOut for perhaps the last two weeks, and as a result (as far as I can determine) the number of people tracking the feed has risen by 100%.

It's going to be interesting over the coming weeks to see if the trend continues.

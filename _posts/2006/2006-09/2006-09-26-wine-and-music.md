This evening finds me re-discovering free time, wine, and most importantly music. I haven't done this in ages - there is a value to be had from relaxing in a dark room with good music. There is another value to be had from discovering new musicians.

I am nearly out of chocolate. The music has been that good.

Tonight's musical discoveries were made while burrowing through the jumble sale that is the emusic website. Standouts have to be Dar Williams, Lisa Loeb, and Jill Sobule. I have linked their names through to the capsule biographies on emusic to avoid either me repeating everything they have said, or getting the pants sued off me for plagiarism.

Oh dear. Just ran out of wine.

Isn't it weird how some people prefer female singers, and others prefer male. Perhaps it's a stereotype that they prefer to listen to or watch the opposite sex. I can only speak for myself, and I typically find myself listening to female singer songwriters more than anything else.

I find myself in the privilaged position of knowing a wonderful singer-songwriter. I admire many things about her, but the thing I admire most is the talent she has - and the effect that talent can have on those around her when she chooses to show it. It reminds me of the Abba lyrics - "I have a talent, a wonderful thing - everyone listens when I start to sing". I've seen it happen with the person I'm talking about...

It makes me wonder if it's a conscious thing - if people with that talent consciously switch it on and off, or if they are completely oblivious to the effect they have on people around them. In terms of my friend I suspect she knows, but chooses not to take advantage of it. This sounds like a very noble position to take, but is probably normal for most people in one way or another - we could all be demeaning to people less fortunate than ourselves, but the idea never enters our head.

What am I saying here?

Wine, chocolate, a darkened room, and singer songwriters. That's what I'm saying.

The photograph above is from the balcony of the house we will be staying at in Turkey for the next week. We fly out from London Heathrow tomorrow afternoon for a week of seclusion and hopefully regain some humour, some spirit, and some much needed rest.

I have never been to Turkey, and have no preconceptions or prejudices about the place or it's people. The little I do know about the country comes from school - off the top of my head, the ancient city of Troy was in Turkey, and many, many famous civilizations have inhabited it's lands at one time or another - the Hittites, the Ottoman empire, the Byzantine empire, the Persians, and of course the Greeks.

We are visiting a place called the "Yediburunlar Lighthouse", a purposely simple (even basic) place - high in the hills away from civilisation. The week will be filled with reading, hiking, drinking, relaxing, and not much else.

I will no doubt return with a thousand photographs, and as many stories about my experiences.

As Mr Baggins once said - "I have to be going now. Goodbye."

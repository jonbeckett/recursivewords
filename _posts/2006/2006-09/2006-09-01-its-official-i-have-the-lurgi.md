While stood in the bathroom brushing my teeth this morning, I noticed red weilds around my neck and thought "hmmm... that's not right".

I then noticed bumpy red blotchy patches all down the insides of my arms, and down my sides and hips. Ah. That might be a problem then.

Next stop was the middle of the lounge... "look at this!" (perhaps I should have thought about what I was going to say, remembering that I was stood naked in the middle of the lounge at the time).

W called the doctor immediately, and miraculously got me an appointment first thing this morning.

The doctor has no idea what it is either yet - and has put me on a course of "Chlorphenamine". They are tiny little tablets, and apparently will make me very drowsy. I'll give an update later - I'm guessing it will be a miracle cure, or I'm going rotten.

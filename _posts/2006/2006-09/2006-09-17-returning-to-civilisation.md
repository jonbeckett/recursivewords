After a week where we seemingly dissappeared off the face of the earth, we are back home and very, very tired.

We flew into London Heathrow from Dalaman airport in Turkey in the early hours of this morning, and have just made our first cup of tea.

I will be sorting out photographs and stuff later today, and trying to figure out where on earth we are going to start with telling the stories. The photo above was taken by a great friend we made while staying at Yediburunlar, and gives a hint of the photographs to come.

In advance of replying, I would like to thank everybody who sent good wishes and "miss you" messages while we were away - it was great waking up to them this morning.

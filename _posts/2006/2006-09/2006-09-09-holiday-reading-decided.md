By the time you read this, I will most likely either be on an aircraft somewhere over europe, or sat on a balcony in the middle of knowhere in deepest Turkey, reading one of the books below. Yes - I finally decided which books to take with me for the week ahead.

I've wanted to read Anna Karenina for a long time now - it has edged in front of "War and Peace" on the book shelf purely because I think it might be an easier read. I'm fed up of hearing about various classic books and not having read them myself. I am more of an "experience" person than a "hear about" person. At this point in time I have no idea what the story is about, other than it's supposed to be a very good commentary on life and society in general.

The second book is the "easy read" - Terry Pratchet's Discworld books are very, very funny indeed. I've read a couple of them and they alway delight me in their inventive humour and perspective on the world we live in. If you've not read any of them, I urge you to at least read "The Color of Magic" - the first Discworld book. If you don't laugh out loud when Twoflower explains the concept of insurance to the witless locals of an Ankh Morpork public house, I don't know what will ("I bet you that you won't burn your own pub down, and you bet me that you will.").

I have also stuck my Palm organiser in the bag - it's got an electronic book reader on it, and I have all manner of books on it - so if I do get stuck for something to read, I always have it as a fall-back. I have been surprised at how easy it is to use an electronic book reader - granted, the screen has to be quite good, but it's just as convenient as a book. It will be interesting to see the "electronic paper" readers when they become more widespread.

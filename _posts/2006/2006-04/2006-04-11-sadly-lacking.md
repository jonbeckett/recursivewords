This blog has been sadly lacking "interesting" entries over the last week or so. There are a few reasons for it, but the main one is that I have a very simple brain, and if I'm busy doing one thing, I won't think to do another. Last week I did some work on my blog script, so everything else suffered as a consequence.

A few people have asked why I use Blogger rather than my own blog script for my day-to-day blog. I don't really have an answer for that; other than I'm lazy and blogger works too, so why not use it?

Okay. Enough techie talk (snore). What else has been on my mind?

Today I seem to have found myself talking to American friends on the net following the splash across the front pages in the US that the Bush Administration has not ruled out the use of nuclear weapons against Iran. The media appear to be jumping off the deep end, but perhaps it takes that to get the US public to care about anything. I'm sometimes left wondering if the average US citizen has much idea about the awful view much of the rest of the world has of their government and armed forces.

It's awful to even have the thought, but a small voice at the back of my mind is saying "if the US wave the nuclear stick, they'll end up defending themselves against a first strike - and it will serve the populance right for voting the Bush administration in again". Like I said - it's not a very objective or rational view, but it's there.

On a related note (highlighting the apathy), what happened to all the "democrats" that were going to leave the US after the republicans got voted back in?

I was talking to my other half about the various problems going on in America a few days ago, and we both seemed to center on the point that America is still a very young country. There is no concept of "socialism" in America - perhaps as a result of the cold war. A socialist government in the US would up taxes for everybody and (shock horror) provide services to everybody - rich, poor, black, white, yellow... everybody. Education. Healthcare. Welfare. You name it. But that doesn't happen in the US because the only option is conservatism.

I expect I'll get some pretty horrible comments in response to this, but it's something I feel strongly about, and my blog is my platform to talk about the things that matter to me.

The whole world would be a far better place if people care and did a bit more for each other.

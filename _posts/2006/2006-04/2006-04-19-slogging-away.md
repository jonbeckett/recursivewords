I feel like I'm shackled to a treadmill at the moment - with no obvious way of getting off.

I have been working on some programming to do with Microsoft Exchange Server 2003 for the last few days - and getting nowhere fast with it.

I doubt anybody will ever read this and have any flicker of recognition or know what on earth I'm talking about, but I'll say it anyway. If you know how to register a "Custom Web Form" against a user's In-Box for viewing messages in the Outlook Web Access (OWA) interface for Microsoft Exchange Server 2003, I'd love to know how you did it.

I've spent two days going round in circles (getting nowhere) and am beginning to run out of ideas.

Anyway... I'm going to go home, eat lots of chocolate, and drink beer.

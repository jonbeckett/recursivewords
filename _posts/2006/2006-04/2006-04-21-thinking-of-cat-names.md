One of my friends on the internet is about to become the proud owner of two kittens. I say "owner" in the loose sense, because as any cat "owner" knows, cats don't have ownerscats have staff.

She asked me the other day if I could come up with any suitable names for two female cats. My only tips at the time were that the name had to go with your own last nameso when the vet keeps their records, the name doesn't look too stupid.

While cycling into work this morning I found myself thinking of cat names.

I came up with all kinds of names for male cats, but have so far only come up with one name for a female cat that I like. It would appear (at least in my mind) that female cat names are more difficult.

My favourite so far for two male cats would be "Kasparov" and "Karpov". They have that certain ring about them that names like "Macavity" have.

Perhaps that's the direction to go in"Old Possums Book of Practical Cats" by T.

S.

Eliot. Names like Plato, Admetus, Electra, and Demeter

Anybody else got any ideas?

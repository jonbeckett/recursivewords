In the absense of regular blog posts recently perhaps a quick review of the week is in order.

I started this week slightly apprehensive - I was planning to do several runs in preperation for a "fun" run this coming monday (yes - stop laughing). The apprehension probably came from the fact that until two weeks ago I hadn't run any serious distance since last May. Somehow I survived and am here to tell the tale.

At work I have started on a new project so have been up to my ears in Javascript, SharePoint, and HTML. Some of the code I've been looking into is pretty inovative - it might even make it into some of my open source projects at some point.

On Thursday night the staff of the company where I work were taken out on a river cruise for the evening to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the company. On the homeward leg of the trip everybody participated in a quiz - which our team would have won had it not been for a certain person on the team disputing half my answers (it turned out I was right on nearly all of them...)

Last night I work up at 3am and then didn't go back to sleep until 5am. How I made it through the day without falling asleep is anybodies guess.

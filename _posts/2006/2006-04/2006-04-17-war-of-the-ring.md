Last year W bought be the "War of the Ring" board game, based on the "Lord of the Rings" books by J.

R.

R.

Tolkien. Today is the first time we have ever played it.

It's by far the biggest and most complicated game either of us have playedneither of us having played any "strategy" or "role playing" board game before. The game comes with two sets of rulesthe "full" game, and the "introductory" gamewe played the easy option (which says something about how complex the full version must be).

The game has taken up most of the day so far, and will probably stretch on into the weekW is playing as the "Free Peoples", and I am playing as the "Shadow Armies"basically, I'm the baddies.

We really have no idea at this point on the best strategy, so this first ever game of it is something of a lottery. There are multiple ways to win for both sides, so it should be a fairly even conflict. Annoyingly, the shadow armies cannot kill Frodo and Samthey can only try to find them and push them away from Mordor so you can see the direction of the game right there.

As I said earlier, we've never really played a proper strategy board game beforeand if this one is anything to go by, it won't be the last. It certainly beats playing computer games, because you have the element of human interraction which would otherwise be missing.

I expect I'll cover the outcome of the game in a blog entry later in the week.

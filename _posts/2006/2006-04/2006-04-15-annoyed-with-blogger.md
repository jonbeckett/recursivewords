Okay. I've started using my own blog script again - mainly out of frustration with Blogger, who's servers refuse to publish my blog at the moment.

At least I know my own server will stay up 99.9% of the time, and it will out-perform Blogger's servers by quite some distance.

If you've just navigated here after looking at my old Blog, or via the FeedBurner feed, please leave a comment to let me know you got here okay!

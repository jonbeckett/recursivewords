After getting in from work this evening I went for a run and managed to churn out 5 miles.

I won't pretend it was easy either - the first couple of miles were incredibly hard work, and I thought about stopping more than once. There was quite a lot of pollen in the air, and it made me start coughing - probably caused by that part of the route taking me through the fields. The air was quite "thick" today too.

Bizarrely it suddenly got much easier through mile 3 and 4, and then it was just about surviving the last mile. As I got close to home I suddenly had an overwhelming urge to be sick (I have no idea why) but survived.

The main thing I want to take from this evening is that I just kept going, and cranked the miles out even though the weather wasn't ideal.

The next run will be Thursday morning before work. Hopefully another 5 miles. I'm not concerned about any times at the moment - just putting more and more miles down, to build core fitness.

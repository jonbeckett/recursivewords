This weekend we went to visit some friends who live down in the southwest of England - a little village called Chappel Knapp. If I was going to paint a word picture to give you some idea, it would have rolling green hills and fields, big old oak trees, farms, people in the village who (shock horror) know each other - basically a quieter, slower pace of life that we are used to living so close to London.

It's the first time for years that we have been able to spend more than a few hours visiting, so you could say the real point of the weekend was to spend quality time with old friends and remember why we were friends in the first place.

As always seems to be the case, the children gravitated towards me and I spent a large part of the weekend drawing pictures, playing football, or perched on the piano stool alongside them creating an unholy noise. I'm not sure why, but I seem to have a certain affinity with children. Perhaps it's because I play on their level.

I'll try and upload some photos when I get home this evening.

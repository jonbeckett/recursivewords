When I arrived at work this morning, I was browsing the "latest news" on Yahoo, and came across the story about Tom Cruise's baby being born... the second paragraph goes as follows...

Cruise, a longtime Scientologist who introduced Holmes to the faith, is likely to follow Scientology's practice of quiet birth. Followers believe the absence of talk and other noise in the delivery room is more healthful for mother and baby.

Okay - so since when has "healthful" been a real word?

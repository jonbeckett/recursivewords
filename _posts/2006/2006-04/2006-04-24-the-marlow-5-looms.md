The weekend after next I am going to run in our local running race - the "Marlow 5". I say "run" in something of a creative sense. I don't think you can describe the speed at which I will devour the course as "running"... more "jogging".

I'll be going out for a run this evening, so will perhaps have more news on fitness / progress / likelihood to drop dead later on. Having run four and a half miles on Saturday, ideally I would like to run further (or rather, for longer) today.

Having left everything so late, I'm facing a bit of a race to be fit in time this year. I'm hoping to go out running on Thursday morning, then Saturday morning, then I'm in a fun-run on Monday (which is a bank holiday in the UK), then two more runs next week before I run our local race.

I hadn't intended to do the "fun" run (yes, I laughed too), but we are going to be near the place it's happening that weekend, so I thought "why not". I know my mother in law is doing it too so it might be fun.

Perhaps all this running will help get rid of some weight. Since I did my knee in late last year I've put loads of weight on.

It's just gone 9 on Easter Monday morning - I've filled the dishwasher up and am sat here in my housecoat with crazy hair and a cup of tea. I really need to think about having a shower and a shave.

Yesterday went really well. W's parents and her brother and his family came for dinner. We did a full roast dinner - turkey, potatoes, carrots, cauliflower, brocolli, parsnips, and cheesecake that W's mum brought for pudding. We had seven sat at the dinner table - I had to put an extra leaf in for the first time in a while (that was fun - remembering how the table works).

Most of the entertainment during the day was provided by W's 2 year old nephew - who took great delight in chasing the cat. The cat thought the cuddles were okay until the cuddler started squealing excitedly - at which point he made a run for it through the catflap and we didn't see him again for the rest of the afternoon.

We finally said goodbye to the last visitors at about 8pm last night, and started on the prospect of eating the various easter eggs we've been given. I may give one or two of mine away - I only usually expect one easter egg, so having company and receiving more was a pleasant surprise.

We also ended up with lots of bottles of wine - mainly because I panicked yesterday morning and raced to the off-license to buy a bottle of white, and a bottle of red to make sure we had the bases covered for dinner - of course all of our visitors walked through the door brandishing wine 

So - Monday is a wind down day. Most of the washing up is done, and we get to have a lazy day. I finally get time (for the first time in a week) to go and read the blogs on my blogroll...

On Thursday night one of my friends gave me a call and asked if I wanted to go out running on Saturday morning. While at work yesterday, I started to wonder if going running was very wise - being overweight and not as fit as I should be (the entire reason for going running is to prepare for the Marlow 5 running race in a couple of weeks time - an annual 5 mile road race).

As yesterday evening wore on I half intended to pretend I had a cold, and pull out of running - only I forgot, and resigned myself to going by default.

I'm glad I went now. A group of us (all unfit) met in Higginson Park in Marlow at 8am this morning, and ran the route of the race. One of the girls is obviously a bit fitter than the rest of us, and cruised off into the distance after the half-way point. My friend and one of the other girls crept away from myself and another girl too.

I spent the last couple of miles feeling knackered but not letting on, and encouraging the girl I was running with. She had a stitch just past halfway and I stayed with her and walked for a few seconds - then made a pact that neither of us should walk until the end. Amazingly we did it, and it was worth it just to see her so chuffed afterwards.

It's also worth pointing out that we ran round in about 45 minutes, which isn't bad going at all for a couple of fun runners who haven' trained.

As a belated birthday present (because the pyjamas I bought her were the wrong size, and you can't get them in her size), I bought W her replacement present today. A Nintendo DS.

I haven't had a go on it yet - we were out in the garden all afternoon planting trees, and she has had her nose in it all evening. I gather from her laughter that the games I got with it are very good indeed.

It came with free copies of "Nintendogs" and "Sonic Rush", and I bought her the DS version of her favourite game - "Animal Crossing - Wild World".

It has to be said that Nintendogs appears to be THE most silly game ever invented - owning a virtual dog that you can teach, take for walks, and that responds to your voice commands. Watching over her shoulder was a surreal experience - imagine watching a very realistic 3D puppy running around a virtual back yard...

I'm told that Animal Crossing is fantastic on the DS - W has already enlisted my services to connect the DS to the wireless network here in the house, so she can share her game with anybody on the internet. Nintendo really do seem to have thought of everything.

When I do finally get a go on it, I'll let you know what I think of it

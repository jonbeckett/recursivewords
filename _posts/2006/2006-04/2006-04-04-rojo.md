I've been playing with a new(ish) website called "Rojo" tonight. It's a news aggregation service - they basically pull together RSS feeds from multiple sources, and based on tags you give them (telling them what you are interested in), they then present items from the feeds for you.

It's a very clever idea to begin with, but they have gone further than that - you can mark posts as having "mojo", which elevates them in the rankings. You can also add your own tags to posts to help classify them.

I've not really played with it a great deal yet, but my own blog is listed on there already - if you click on the "blogging" tag within Rojo, you'll see mine listed 

The URL to visit is;

Let me know what you think!

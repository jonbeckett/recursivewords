While helping a couple of people on the internet last night, I was watching television out of the corner of me eye - and a news story made me look up.

Apparently the broadcast news in the UK have just woken up to the whole "blog" publishing thing - they were reporting on the various bloggers around the world who have been published as books. Bit late maybe? I think part of the reason they bothered with the story is because the "Blooker Prize" has had a big marketing push. (here' the official website).

It will be interesting to see what happens with published blogs - I can't see how they can quite work if the reader doesn't have the option of commenting. For me, half the fun of writing in my blog is to "talk" to an imaginary audience about whatever is on my mind, and sometimes get a comment or two in response. Primarily the writing is for my own benefit, so I don't really mind if anybody bothers to comment or not.

With "blog prizes" in mind, I'm wondering what is out there in the form of awards programmes for blogs - I know of the "webbies", but very little else... if you happen to know about any blog award type things let me know! (who knows - I might end up making a blog award website where people can vote on them or something).

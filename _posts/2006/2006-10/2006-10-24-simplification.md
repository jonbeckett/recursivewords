After several days being dissatisfied with the look and feel of my blog, I have decided that "simple is best". It's about the words, after all - not how pretty the blog looks on the screen. I'm guessing that most people read the RSS feed anyway, so never see the real blog.

Here it is, anyway - if you are reading this in a feed, click here to have a look, and feel free to comment!

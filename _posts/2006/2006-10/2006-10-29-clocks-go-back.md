The clocks went back this morning - we are finally back on GMT. We get an hour extra in bed, and the mornings are light once again.

I just took the photograph in the garden - isn't it wonderful how the morning light catches spider webs?

Changing subject violently, I was trying to help a friend find a suitable place to write her first blog, and so found myself looking at the various options available. I suggested Blogger, WordPress, or Vox. Why is it that when you suggest anything to anybody, those tried and trusted services will die spectacularly and embarrass you completely?

Blogger crashed in all directions (why do so many people use it?), WordPress - through their own hosting service - doesn't really let you customize it's look and feel, and Vox displayed the reliability of a baby's bottom.

While looking at Vox I almost became enthused to the point of fundamentalism; the guys that built LiveJournal seem to have constructed the best online blogging/community tool I have ever seen - it is far better than MySpace or Yahoo 360. It's Achilles heal is undoubtedly it's unreliability. While talking telling my friend to hang on for 2 seconds while I changed the design on my blog at Vox, the entire site blew to pieces... and it's still not behaving now. I tried all the tricks in the book - logging in with a different browser, logging in on a different computer... none of it worked. That meant the entire Vox system must be broken... that's worrying.

The more worrying this is that I seem to become cynical about everything I touch. Anything that starts out "looking good" ends up having so many faults with it that I feel the need to write in this blog about it. Perhaps I should re-title the Blog "here writes Jonathan Beckett, and he's bloody annoyed."

Anyway - we're off to visit W's parents today. If I survive without storing up too many annoyances caused by the journey over there (they are wonderful people, but the journey involves venturing onto a road system full of idiot sunday drivers - mostly old people going to garden centers), I will write about the experience later.

Auf Weidersehen!

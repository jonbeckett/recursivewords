While running around doing ten things at once since getting in from work this evening I thought it might be worth recording "just another day in my life" for the interest and amusement of others.

The morning started at 7:15 when the radio alarm kicked into life. I somehow managed to switch it off without really waking up... probably prompted to do so by a nudge from W. Apparently I respond to voice commands without waking up - "you're snoring" being the most common.

So... I woke up again at 8 and contemplated the pillow for a few minutes before deciding that in order to have half a chance of getting to work on time, I had to get up right then.

So - downstairs. Shower. Shave. Brush teeth. Feed cat. Draw curtains. Upstairs. Get dressed (meaning, hunt for socks and underwear, and clean clothes to take to work based on the fact that it's raining). Downstairs. Fill kettle and switch on. Make sandwiches. Make tea for myself and W who has just appeared in her pyjamas too. Find bike helmet. Pack bag with lunch, change of clothes, phone, palm organiser, and house keys). Put on bike helmet, sunglasses, and personal stereo. Down tea. Kiss W. Leave house. Fish bike from shed. Ride to work.

The ride to work is it' usual eventful dodgems race through town, fighting clueless motorists who roll across junctions without looking, and idiotic pensioners who look at you with a particular snearing impression as you stop them from stumbling into the road in front of you...

I finally arrive at the office (3 miles and about 12 minutes later), park the bike, dump my bag, get changed, and arrive at my desk. It's 8:57am.

The work day is filled with conversations about programming, the latest dilbert cartoon on my desk pad, and mostly with hours of writing programming and banging my head against problems too numerous and complex to begin to describe here. Lunchtime comes and goes with me having eaten my sandwiches at 11:30, and finding myself buying a half squashed chocolate bar from the sandwich man who arrives at 1pm.

The late afternoon is punctuated by the odd friend who pops up on Google Talk or Yahoo Messenger, and we shoot the breeze together for a few minutes.

The last couple of hours dissappear in a team meeting where we spend half the meeting watching various people take turns trying to use the conference phone with little success. Finally it's 5:30pm and I change clothes, pack my laptop into my bag (to do some work over the weekend), and re-mount the bike to come home through the constant rain.

Arriving home, the cat is waiting in the alleyway for me, and tries to get himself run over by my bike. The bike goes back in the shed (after ice skating my way across the wet decking), and I'm in the house, turning the burglar alarm off.

Feed the cat. Get out of wet clothes. Have another shower. Change into pyjamas because I can't be bothered to get more clothes dirty. Put washing in washing machine. Put wet washing in dryer. Empty dishwasher. Re-fill dishwasher with dirty stuff. Put kettle on.

W arrives home at this point, and I make us both a cup of tea. She's had a crappy day so I tell her to go sit down while I finish making the cup of tea. I take the tea in, then fish the Gamecube out and plug it in for her on the big telly in the back room.

Finally I sit down at the computer (at about 7:30pm), clear a few emails, and chat with a few friends on the internet. Lastly I order dinner from the local Indian Takeaway, and am waiting for it to arrive as I type this (at 8pm).

I can confidently predict that the rest of the evening will be filled with eating dinner, watching a crap movie, and then maybe hanging out with friends online into the early hours before crashing into bed, ready to start the weekend.

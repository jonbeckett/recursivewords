I started to feel a little better this afternoon, so dragged the work laptop from my bag, set it down on the desk, and tried to kickstart my head.

The product of several hours is about 20 lines of programming. My mind has gone on vacation with the cold, and so it would seem has my energy - my eyelids have become increasingy heavy during the afternoon. It is all I can do at the moment to keep them open.

I have this vision of W arriving home from work, finding me slumped over the computer desk with my head on the keyboard, busily typing the 268th page of random letters into a blog entry.

The positive to take from today is that I'm better than yesterday - so with a little luck normal service (from me) will resume tomorrow.

Perhaps a hot chocolate might be the thing... hmmm...

In events occurring entirely within Jonathan's head this morning, the Empire launched an assault on the computer desk. They met staunch resistance from a lone software developer sat in his robe, and it is rumoured that his scary hair affected the oppressor's morale considerably.

Yes. It is an ATAT - one of the Star Wars toys from the 1970s. Yes, it is stood on my desk with dramatic lighting, and yes, I did "set it up that way"... It seemed like a cool / stupid / funny thing to do at the time.

At least if I comment on your blog, and you come back this way you will have something entertaining to see, rather than the usual introspective drivel.

And remember - the force will be with you. Always.

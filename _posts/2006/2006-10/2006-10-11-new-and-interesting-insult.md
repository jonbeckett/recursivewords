I was just reading the comments to a post on Digg, and came across a new insult to hurl at people...

Assclown.

Isn't it great  You could use it in all sorts of interesting ways... "you assclown!", "stop assclowing around"...

Ho hum.

In an effort to write something of worth in this blog entry, I should perhaps communicate to the world that I am once more among the ranks of the working (or should that be living?). I scraped myself onto my bike this morning and cycled the three miles to the office. In a more romantic universe I would have battled through blizzards and hailstorms, and staggered, frostbitten, into the office. Unfortunately the "real world" is far less dramatic.

Half the morning has been spent catching up with things, blowing my nose until I have slight hearing loss, and reading Dilbert. I have a Dilbert desk pad thing with a new cartoon for each day - reading about Dilbert and his colleagues various exploits is rapidly becoming an essential part of the morning routine.

It's now lunchtime and I find myself wondering if my friends are online.

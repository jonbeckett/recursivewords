After a week spent twiddling my thumbs, and "evaluating" various pieces of software at work, I had to "get back on the bike" today - and start crunching out code. Quite surprisingly it has lifted my spirits, and I have no idea why.

Perhaps part of the reason for my change in mood may be the "clunk" I heard this morning. I was just waking up - and peeping at the alarm clock through a gap in the bedclothes. At first I heard steps on the front driveway, and then the rustle of letters being poked through the letterbox, followed by a gentle thud as something heaving than a letter fell into the house.

I held my breath and waited for the anticipated noise - and it came. Rat tat tat. Damn and blast. The rapping on the door meant that the postman was delivering something that wouldn't fit through the letterbox, and that meant getting out of bed. In a hurry.

There's another story here, that I should relate before carrying on with the next 10 seconds of the story - the postmen we have had over the last few years have all left parcels on our doorstep, banged on the door, and then walked on to the next house without waiting. This includes parcels requiring signiatures - where the postman invariably signs the paperwork himself. We have complained more than once, and been fobbed off.

So... I jumped out of bed, grabbed my robe, and was halfway across the landing, struggling to put my arms through the arm holes, when I looked out of the window on the landing (half naked), and the postman spotted me as he turned in to next door's garden. I expect he will need counselling. I scare myself some mornings when I look in the mirror.

I finally arrived in the hallway, and found the collection of junk mail, free papers, and perhaps one letter that was actually worth reading - and on top of them all a jiffy bag that seemed appropriately Nintendo 64 cartridge shaped. You can see where this is going, can't you.

I am now the proud owner of Mario 64, to go with the Nintendo 64 that I "aquired" last weekend. It's only been 10 years since the game came out, but still - better late than never. I confidently predict that I won't be online much tonight. I have a date with two Italian plumbers and a princess (now there's a leading remark).

If you are wondering what arrived that wouldn't fit through the letterbox - I cannot tell you. If there is a chance that you will be coming to our annual christmas party, the parcel on the doorstep may well have been filled with various stocking presents to hand out while dressed in rather comedic fashion as Father Christmas.

I thought it might be fun to take a picture of the desk at home in the study... this is where all the geekiness eminates from.

Just out of shot on the left there is an HP LaserJet and a flatbed scanner. The laptop is an archaic Toshiba Satellite (propped against the wall because the hinge on the screen has gone). The main machine is a Compaq Presario, hidden away under the desk - with a Dell flat screen on top of the desk (the Compaq flat screen died). Ummm... there's the obligitory "cute couple" photo, can of beer, my "Procrastinator" pad, and some very, very geeky magazines.

Out of view behind you, there is an enormous book case filled with titles such as "Running Linux", "The C++ Programming Language", "Programming PHP", "Web Database Applications", "Delphi in a Nutshell", and "CGI Programming with Perl"...

Oh - the beer in the photo is a Budvar. For the benefit of those of you in America, Budvar is the "real thing" - made by the real Budweiser company - not the idiotic American one that claims their drinks are great because they are "fresh" (the word lager means "kept"... figure it out for yourself). If you are wondering why the name of the American beer has become "bud", wonder no more - they tried to stop the original Budweiser company and lost spectacularly.

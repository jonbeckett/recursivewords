After a particularly shitty day at work, after dinner I went to the local garage and bought a big bag or rubbish. I can now announce that I just ate a 250 gram bar of Cadbury's chocolate. Yay me.

The original mission had been to buy some tubs of ice cream, but they didn't have any - which caused a kind of internal temper tantrum; culminating in me finding myself at the counter with a bag of Minstrels, a 200g bar of Galaxy, a 250g bar of Cadbury's, a tube of Pringles, and a big bottle of Lucozade.

I can almost feel the fat building in Nutty Professor style around my belly and chin.

I have also drunk two thirds of a bottle of wine, and am contemplating putting some beer in the fridge. There are not good things to be doing or have done.

Perhaps I should stop right now.

On a slightly "fitter" note, I got signed up for the local 5 kilometer "Santa" fun run early in December - apparently I am being roped into dressing up as Father Christmas (in full costume) to run 5k around town in aid of various charities - among them Breakthrough Breast Cancer, which W does various events for.

I could probably run 5k now if pressed, so I'm not unduly worried about it - I do feel (having seen photos) that I should make more of an effort than most with my costume - I'll probably make sure I have a HUGE beard, and a MASSIVE belly. I'll make sure my photo gets taken too (no, I'm not going to streak - my bits are not impressive enough - my legs might be though).

I've lost my train of thought now...

Perhaps I may have something more insightful to write by tomorrow. If you're wondering, the photo is of my bike light while pedalling along at 6:30pm this evening on the way home from work. It really was that dark.

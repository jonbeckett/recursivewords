While scouting interesting blogs to read earlier this evening, I came across "NaBloPoMo" - National Blog Posting Month.

I've nearly taken part in NaNoWriMo (National Novel Writing Month) twice now - pulling out on both occasions within days of the start. In both cases my life turned upside down within days of starting. For those who have no idea what I am writing about, or what either NaBloPoMo, or NaNoWriMo are, here's a quick explanation...

NaNoWriMo is a yearly challenge on the internet to write a 50,000 word novel in the calendar month of November. I think it's a great challenge - wonderfully eccentric - romantic even. The only reward you have for writing the novel is exactly that - you will have written a novel. The challenge emphasises the quantity of your output over everything - the argument being that while you may write a lot of rubbish, some of it may be brilliant.

NaBloPoMo is a new challenge - and far more achievable - to post to your blog on every day of November.

Over the past few days I have wondered about taking part in NaNoWriMo again this year, but know that personal commitments to do with the adoption process are going to eat into the time I might have available. Therefore the discovery of NaBloPoMo has put an enormous smile on my face. I already write in this blog nearly every day, so it's not going to be much of a stretch.

The graphic you see at the top right of the blog (if you're looking at the front page) is one of the official badges for the competition - I will be carrying it throughout November.

If you write a blog too and are taking part, let me know and I promise to come and read your blog each day!

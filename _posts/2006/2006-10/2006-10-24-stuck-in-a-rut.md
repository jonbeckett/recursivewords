My life at the moment seems to be a never ending series of "things to do". I need to make some kind of change before I go mad. Perhaps getting out of the house for at least one evening during the week might be a good idea - even if it's just down to the local pub for a pint.

While on the subject of going to the pub, it is with great fanfare that I announce I have been invited to my first "blog meet". I'm not quite sure what happens, or what the other people are going to be like. I will admit to private, comedic visions of everybody wearing viking helmets and doing funny handshakes. Perhaps I watched too much television when I was younger.

The invitation has been extended by Petite Anglaise, and is happening at a highly secret location (that serves alcoholic beverages) in London early next month. The time window of the occaision is worryingly wide - I can see scenes where people arrive and wonder who the very tall, slightly loud, slightly slurred person is who arrived too early.

I'll try and remember to take a camera, and might even publish some of the photos if those in them are not opposed to the idea (depends on how spectacular their viking helmets might be, I suppose).

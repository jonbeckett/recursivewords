I am off work today, having finally caught the lurgi that W has been suffering with for the last week. I'm not coughing as much as her, but that might have something to do with me fetching medicine from the local pharmacist as soon as I got up this morning. While there is a certain comfort to be had from wallowing in a cough or cold, a little voice in the bottom of my mind tells me that the weekend is nearly upon us, and unless I pump my body full of medication, the weekend is going to be wasted.

I am dosed up on Pholcodine, wrapped up in several layers of clothing, and huddled in the study, sat on my feet in front of my best friend - the computer. Perhaps I should list various people as my "best friends", but if I include inanimate objects that I spend a lot of time with, then my computer would be at the top of the list. How sad...

So - what else has been going on in my slightly drowsy, cough filled day?

I have been reading some of the blogs that will be taking part in the NaBloPoMo event next month. Favourite so far has to be "The 13th Apostol" - it's funny, intelligent, quirky, and has made me smile so far. I wish she would switch her comments on (I like writing comments), but this is a blessing in some ways - I am being forced to learn about trackbacks.

Oh - I have an apology to make too.

Yesterday I wrote about the very important news that I had aquired a Nintendo 64 from E-Bay, and that it had arrived minus one very important wire that meant I couldn't play with it.

I am an idiot. A king sized one, as it turns out.

The power brick on the Nintendo 64 plus directly into the back of the console. Now you would think, after working with and owning computers for 20 years, and having played just about every major video game console over that time period (and before - my brother had an Atari VCS2600) that I would have a slightly bigger clue about these things. Apparently I do not.

I have just written a grovelingly funny email to the seller on E-Bay who went to her local video game store and asked about the missing wire... which is of course missing BECAUSE IT DOESN'T EXIST!

Well at least I admit when I've been stupid. That's a redeeming feature isn't it?

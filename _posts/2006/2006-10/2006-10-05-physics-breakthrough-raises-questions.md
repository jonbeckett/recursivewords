I have just been reading about the physics breakthrough that has enabled scientists to move several billion atoms from one point to another in space (yes, they have figured out the basis for the transporter from Star Trek).

Apparently the process involves creating a new copy of the matter while simultaneously destroying the previous copy - through a process called "quantum entanglement". At the moment they have only moved a few billion atoms, but you can see where this is headed...

If this technology does run, it will cause havoc among those with "faith". If you were transported between two points, is the person at the destination "you" ?

The original "you" would have been destroyed at the point of origin, and a new version built at the destination. The copy would be identical in every way - but would it be "you" ?

Does this mean (following current ideological dogma forced on us by the church which still has it's fingers meddling throughout society) that the original version of the person is dead?

It's an interesting question, and one we will not have to deal with in our lifetime. Our great grandchildren may have to though...

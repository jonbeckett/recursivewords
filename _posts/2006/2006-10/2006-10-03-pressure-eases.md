I had been contemplating the idea of bringing my laptop home from work throughout the evenings this week and doing unpaid overtime to (hopefully) deliver the final round of changes to the project I am working on before the end of the week.

The plan had been to visit the client site early next week and install their production system - with the finished software. That has now been pushed back a week. When word came from the client this afternoon a sense of calm returned to both myself and the team. Rather than sprinting towards the finish line, we are now able to walk slowly and carefully.

In other news today I had the weirdest dream in quite some time this morning. I don't recall much about it now, other than it involved getting my hair cut, and the lady cutting my hair telling me that she loved my writing. Thinking about it, I did have a conversation on the internet with a reader of my blog yesterday, and the person in question has long hair in her profile photo. That must be it.

My mind is a mystery unto itself.

I'm sat here kicking my heals - W is watching CSI in the lounge, and I am holed up in the study. I really can't be bothered with watching television any more - the internet has replaced it to a great extent in my life. I still watch movies on DVD, and breakfast news, but that's about it. If you had told me several years ago that this would be the case, I would have laughed - I used to watch a lot of television.

p.s. W thinks "Horatio" in CSI Miami is wonderful (she's going to kill me for saying that).

I was watching one of my favourite video "netcasts" earlier - Amanda Across America, and just had to share today's post... click on the image to view it :

Amanda visited WKRN Nashville in the US, and talked to their editor about the decision to move their television news over to an internet based operation, hiring bloggers instead of traditional print journalists.

It's a fantastic story, and describes many of the reasons why blogging is so great.

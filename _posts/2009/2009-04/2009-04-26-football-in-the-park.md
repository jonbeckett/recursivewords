In between working on a freelance webdesign contract, taking our middle girl to a "modern dance" rehearsal, trudging around town, and then totally missing the Formula One (again), I spent an hour playing football with our eldest and youngest in the park in town - and cursed that I had not taken a camera with me.

The journey home from town took us to the supermarket to buy frozen chips and cheese (to make - you guessed it - cheesy chips), and then on to the toy shop. We don't often give the children pocket money because they are not really old enough yet, and they haven't asked - we do however take them to the toy shop every so often with a spending limit.

Today we came away with Kerplunk, cheerleader pom-poms (I bet they have a real name), and a knitting kit (!?). So far Kerplunk is winning the popularity contest easily.

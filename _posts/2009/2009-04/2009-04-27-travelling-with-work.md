I'll be leaving the house in the early hours of tomorrow morning to travel with work. I have been working as part of a team to build a project that we are showing the client for the first time tomorrow morning.

Tomorrow night will be spent in some faceless hotel before spending the entire next day sat in a succession of board rooms, trying to ascertain what we will be racing to build over the next couple of months.

I'll just be glad when we can slow down a bit. The last few weeks (and weekends) have been filled with me sitting in front of a computer for perhaps 16 hours of each day. Not good.

Expect all manner of deep thought nonsense from my temporary jail tomorrow night (if the hotel has broadband) - otherwise it will be shortened stupidity via the iPhone.

I've spent the last hour looking at Tumblr after a far flung friend (laurenmalone.tumblr.com) voiced her admiration of it. I was surprised - she has been hosting her blog on Squarespace for the last couple of years - Squarespace is widely regarded as perhaps the best blogging platform in existence. As an aside, how Lauren isn't an A-List blogger up with the Dooce's of this world is anybody's guess - go read her blog for yourself - you'll ask yourself the same question.

I digress.

I spent an hour messing around with Tumblr - figuring out what was new since I last looked at it (I had a Tumblr account for a long time). If you have the same kind of enquiring mind that I do, "just taking a look" is never "just taking a look". Within minutes I had recreated my Tumblog - jonbeckett.tumblr.com - and was sucking in my Twitter, Flickr and blog feeds.

I am my own worst enemy - it didn't stop there. Over the next hour I played with 12seconds.tv again, and then headed over to Vimeo.

Before I knew it, Saturday afternoon had vanished. If there was a medal for throwing time away on fruitless pursuits, I could be a multiple olympic champion.

How have you wasted your saturday?

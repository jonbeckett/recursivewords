Over the four days of the easter break, I have taken an unfeasible number of photos of the kids this year. Here are a few of today's... (warning - crap load of photos below)

If the last 4 days have proven anything (beyond being incredibly hard work), they have proven that spending time with your children - and sharing that time with friends and family is wonderfully rewarding. We only get this chance to share their young lives once - if we miss it, we will regret it for the rest of our lives.

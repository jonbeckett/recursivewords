Just one of the exchanges that took place today;

"Dad, want toast"

"I've made you cereal - eat it while I make you toast"

(5 minutes later I am accosted on the stairs)

"Make toast Dad?"

"Hang on - I'm busy"

"Please Dad"

"I said I'm busy"

"Pleeeeaasse"

"Busy."

"Pleeeeeeaaaaassssseee"

"Fine. I'll be late for work."

(I make toast, and deliver it to the dinner table)

"Here's your toast"

(4 yr old girl shrugs, doesn't leave couch)

"Come and eat your toast 

... and she damn well grinned at me.

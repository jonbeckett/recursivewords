The last few days have been unrelenting.

Saturday

Saturday was ever so slightly mental - filled from 7 in the morning until 4pm with the sprint to prepare for W's birthday party. It was the first big party we have ever done, and probably the last before the girls grow up. Hiring the venue and music, and buying the food cost a colossal amount of money - and I did all the organisation single handed after repeated complaints in previous years that W ends up doing everything herself... all she had to do this time was turn up.

I didn't do everything myself - thanks go to two wonderful friends who pitched in on the day to get the last couple of things sorted out with me. Her best friend arrived an hour early at the venue with me to decorate the rooms (yes, you read right - rooms).

The only downer of the night was that I did drop the ball - I forgot to take cash to pay the DJ. After listening to him bitch about it, I agreed to pay him more, and he turned up the next morning to collect his cash. I felt like reporting him to the tax man, but didn't in the end.

Sunday

I got back up at 7 to watch the Australian Grand Prix. I also went round the house and corrected the clocks for British Summer Time. W came rushing down mid-morning (after sleeping off the after effects of her party) in a mad panic - about taking the girls to their swimming lessons.

After explaining that the clocks were all correct, she stared at me - not quite piecing together the elements of her panic for a few moments.

The rest of Sunday was spent tidying the house, washing up, and attempting to get some freelance work done. I finally fell into bed at about 11.

Monday

Back on normal routine, we were up at 7, sprinted to get the girls to their various schools, and then I sat in a technical meeting at work for 7 hours before returning home to prepare for a day on-site.

Tuesday

Up at 5am. Caught the train out of town at 6:04, and arrived at my destination at 9am. Spent the next 7 hours in a technical meeting, and then travelled home in quite some style - in a Porsche 911 owned by another contractor. Fell asleep on the desk at home while trying to answer emails, and was woken by an angry W.

Wednesday

Today. Spent all day in the office installing software, filing time reports, and going nowhere quickly. Tomorrow will be another all-day technical meeting.

My life is one long round of work, travel, work, travel, work, and more work at the moment. Where the weekend should have been fun, I spent all of it either stressing about everything, or tidying up behind others... it was worth it though to see that everybody else was having fun.

I'd love to take a day off soon, but also know that the project at work will be a race against time for the next six weeks - and weekends aren't an option either - W relies on me to give her a day off when I can. In the middle of all this I try and get freelance work done too.

I need Doc Brown's phone number - I need the Flux Capacitor. It will solve lots of problems for me.

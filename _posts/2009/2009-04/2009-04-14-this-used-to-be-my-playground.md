There was a time when I would find a quiet hour to sit at the computer and write. The keyboard served as a conduit between mind and computer, translating the days thoughts, experiences and frustrations into something of interest for the wider world.

The quiet hour grows rare, as do the chances to scribble passing thoughts into the Moleskine. The first fifty or so pages of my latest notebook are filled with complicated diagrams, and technical language that may as well be heiroglyphs.

It is becoming more difficult to find a part of my world to share, quite apart from finding time to share it. Past readers will no doubt have noticed the increasing likelihood that I post photos - and also know from their own experience why I am doing it - it's easier.

While at dinner with friends on Sunday evening, I was asked if I would be taking part in the local 5 mile run this year - and I had to explain about not having time to train. A colleague from work boasted that he found time, and his other half tore into him. It would appear that the time I spend with the children, tidying up, washing up, or playing with the children is a great deal more than many.

What am I trying to say here ?

Perhaps that there are only so many hours in the day, and that at the moment they don't stretch far enough for me to find an hour - as I have done this evening - to share a part of myself with those who read the rubbish I write.

Who knows - perhaps scarsity will increase quality. Instead of a torrent of garbage, I will produce a trickle of barely passable rubbish.

One day I'll get around to reading some of the blogroll too - which is starting to bear a striking resemblence to cities of earth in Wall-E.

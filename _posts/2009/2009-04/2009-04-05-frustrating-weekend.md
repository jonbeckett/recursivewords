I had hoped to make progress with a number of freelance projects this weekend. It didn't happen (or at least it hasn't happened yet - I forsee a very late night ahead).

I worked like an idiot all week in order to clear Saturday to work on various projects, and ended up getting nothing done because of some arcane issue to do with virtual machine networking. I spent half the day and most of the evening installing and configuring a new Linux webserver for myself - which is still behaving unpredictably.

The best answer will be to buy a webserver for myself (which will take the added complexity of virtual machines out of the equation), but after spending pretty much everything I have earned recently on W's party and birthday present, I can't afford to buy myself anything - hence spending all damn day trying to make what I have do two jobs at once.

Today (Sunday), I had hoped to watch the Malaysian Grand Prix on television - this didn't happen either, and nearly caused me to get my head bit off when I mentioned it. In the end I listened to most of it on Radio 5 while en-route to my in-laws (deciphered inbetween the children shouting and screaming), and the final couple of minutes at their house.

This afternoon I find myself sat alone at my inlaws with my netbook. The kids are watching a television programme they press-ganged their Grandad into putting on, and their Mum and Nan are at Oxford Literary Festival. All I seem to have done all afternoon is repeatedly tell them off, tidy up behind them, put things away, and repair damage they have done.

Fast forward to midnight...

We got home at about 9pm, and ever since I have been working on freelance projects in the study - it's freezing in here, but I didn't notice until just now when I started shivering. At least I got something done this weekend...

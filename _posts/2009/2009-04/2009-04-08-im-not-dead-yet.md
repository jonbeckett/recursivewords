The title is of course a reference to a rather famous scene from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. It also refers to the lack of wordage pouring forth from my fingers in recent days.

I am what most people might term "idiotically busy" - with my day job, freelance work, and home life.

The long Easter weekend is approaching, and I'm looking forward to the excuse to not do much (which of course is not going to happen - the weekend has already been filled with activities that I will be expected to take part in enthusiastically, even though I haven't really had a "day off" in weeks).

I will not be going to church on Sunday or doing anything remotely religious. If people with faith in what they are told to believe can cause me to get a day or two off work, I'm not going to complain about it.

I think I'm finally beginning to get my head around Tumblr. Where WordPress is designed for wordsmiths - people with a story to tell - Tumblr is designed for people (like me) who find lots of interesting stuff, and wish they had an easy way of storing and sharing it.

I think perhaps the secret behind Tumblr is it's simplicity. Take the "dashboard" for example;

Notice you are not just writing "a post" in your Tumblr scrapbook - you are throwing a conversation, a link, a photo, a video, or whatever - and it will be represented appropriately. To make life even easier, there are Javascript bookmarklets for your browser, and an iPhone application.

The iPhone application suddenly makes the idea of "Life Blogging" far more realistic for the rest of us - being able to note photos, observations, and thoughts while on the move.

You read the title correctly. Given the ever increasing demands on my time over the last month or so, the frequency and quality of my blog posts has hit an all time low. Coinciding with all of this, one of my greatest friends on the internet has switched to Tumblr, and most of my friends and colleagues are finally using Twitter.

A couple of years ago I looked at Tumblr, and liked what I saw. The only thing that stopped me from using it was the dearth of friends using it. There is also a certain level of circumspection based on the fact that any hosted service could have it's plug pulled at any point - taking your words with it.

It's difficult. Do we hold on to the words we write - the thoughts we share - or do we cast them out into the world, and let them go? Will we put less effort in as a result ?

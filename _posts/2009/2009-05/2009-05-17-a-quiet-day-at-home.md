I had planned to stay at home today and bury myself in a couple of freelance projects that have been hitting the skids recently (due to the crazy schedules I've mentioned in the past). I didn't exactly count on feeling like crap. The family have been out all day visiting the in-laws, and I am sat here huddled in my biggest, thickest jumper, with the heating turned up, shivering like an idiot.

Ho hum.

I'm caught in some kind of blogging malaise at the moment too - not particularly being interested in writing anything, and not really knowing why. While I'm sure it will be transitory, it's unsettling. I know damn well that visiting friend's blogs around the world will give me all kinds of encouragement to write something.

Encouragement is not the right word at all.

This is the problem - if you don't write regularly, your already pathetic word power starts to pour down the drain (along with all the other stuff I used to know). What is the word to describe when you see something and it makes you want to take part ?

Perhaps it's the bug I have that's eating brain cells. Yes - I'll convince myself that my brain is busy working out how to build antibodies to fight whatever lethal lurgy the kids have given me this time. It's a better thought than I am becoming more stupid by the day.

I can't afford to be ill.

Perhaps being busy kills creativity. Perhaps that's it. I'm so damn overrun with things I should be doing, I don't have any damn time to dream stuff up... here's hoping things improve soon.

I thought it might be interesting to share the results of my week long assault on Tumblr, and it's ranking system - "Tumblarity"...

After a week of posting, sharing, following, liking, and re-blogging, I have vaulted myself from a nobody to the top 150 users of Tumblr in the UK. I did this on the back of about half an hour each evening.

Perhaps the most interesting outcome of the experiment has been the realisation that I like Tumblr more than traditional blogging. It seems much closer to scrap-booking than writing - and there's something refreshing about that. As I have built a list of people to follow (through the excellent directory and search facilities), my "dashboard" page has become a favoured destination to spend a few minutes.

At the moment I have the Disqus commenting system installed because Tumblr has nothing of it's own - but am rapidly coming to the conclusion that it doesn't need it. Tumblr is more about sharing, and re-sharing than passing judgement. If you like something you mark it as liked. If you want to share something with others, you re-blog it... end of story. Like I said - it's refreshing. A different take.

There are some nice gadgets included too - the ability to suck in a few of your other feeds is invaluable - you'll most likely integrate it with Twitter, Flickr, and perhaps your wordpress blog - meaning that any posts to those services appear in your Tumblog too.

If you're interested in taking a look, head on over to the Tumblr home page at www.tumblr.com. Then head over to my Tumblog - jonbeckett.tumblr.com and follow me

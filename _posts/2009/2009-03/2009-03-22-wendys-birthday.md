In celebrations normally reserved for the Queen, W is having two celebrations this year - the first (today) on her actual birthday, and the second next weekend at the party I'm throwing for her on account of it being a rather special number this time.

This year W's birthday coincided with Mothers Day here in the UK, which was apt given our year old status as a family. We headed down to the Church in town this morning for our middle girl to take part in the service with the rest of her friends from school, before a meal with W's parents.

Here are a few photos from the day;

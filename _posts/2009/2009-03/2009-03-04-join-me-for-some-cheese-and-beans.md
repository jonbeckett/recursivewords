I gone done and did it. Again. (and yes, I am quite aware of how many grammar rules the first sentence breaks. I also know this footnote should not have started with "and").

Henceforth, my personal blog exists here;

www.cheeseandbeans.com

This will be the last time such a move takes place. After something like 8 years of writing a blog of various sorts online, this is the first time I have purchased a domain name specifically for a personal blog. I am also moving my technical blog to it's own home online, although that's another subject for another time.

The reasons for this final move are many. When I began picking up freelance work some months ago, I had reduced my online "footprint" significantly - giving some projects away (PluggedOut comes to mind), putting some projects on life support (ThoughtCafe), and closing accounts all over the place (Posterous, Tumblr, MySpace).

I had not considered that the traces I leave on the internet - my words, photos, thoughts, views, and crackpot opinions - would be read by those who might one day hire my services. It therefore became obvious that if I choose to participate in the blogosphere, I need to do it on my own terms. I need to have my own websites which extend the little brand and influence I have beyond the bounds of the work that I do.

If you start to see me taking more care with the words and photographs I am sharing, it's entirely intentional.

In blogging terms, after eight years I guess I'm finally growing up.

We took the kids to the woods at the weekend, and in the face of continual moon faced complaints about never being allowed to do anything from our eight year old, we let her carry the small point-and-shoot camera.

She dropped it. Hard. I didn't notice until this morning. It's broken.

I'm not sure what I'm more annoyed about - having no little camera now, or that she didn't tell me. I'm also wondering if we get it replaced on the home insurance or not - while it wasn't the cheapest camera in the world, it's not the best either - the old Sony Cybershot that I lost was far, far better.

Footnote - apologies to 8 year old. Mum dropped the camera getting out of the car. Still don't know if to claim on house insurance or not.

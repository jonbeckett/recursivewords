I discovered her one morning in 1991 while watching breakfast television. She was there during the hundreds of hours spent commuting to and from London. She was there while walking the Cumbria Way. She was there when we discovered we could not have children, and she is playing now as three little girls sleep upstairs and I work late into the night.

Tori Amos has become the soundtrack to my life, and I wouldn't exchange her words and music for anybody else.

She is my compass, whispering in my ear during the quiet times. Her songs bring new meanings in times of sadness, loneliness, hope, happiness, and joy.

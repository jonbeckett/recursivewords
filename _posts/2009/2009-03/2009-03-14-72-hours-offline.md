The wheels fell off our broadband connection at home a couple of days ago in spectacular style, and it's starting to feel like somebody has cut my air supply off.

The online world has become a preferred place to seek entertainment, knowledge, community, and friends over the last few years - and given the various demands on my day, it has become increasingly persuasive.

The computer at home is always on - email is checked minutes after getting up while running between the shower and making the kids lunch and breakfast. Throughout the working day the iPhone in my pocket vibrates to announce new emails and reminders. Quiet moments will invariably find me checking Twitter to find out what friends are doing, or catching up on my runaway blogroll.

Retuning home on an evening I am usually doing freelance work for some client or another, and the connection will become more entrenched - with conduits open in the background to Twitter, Windows Live Messenger, Yahoo Messenger, AOL Instant Messenger, ICQ, IRC, Skype, Facebook, LinkedIn, and more. The computer speakers will continually murmur a soft heartbeat of the worldwide community sharing their day with each other.

Tonight that connection is down. Gone. Closed. Silent.

Given the various commitments I have to paying clients for freelance work, I will have to find a suitable cafe with internet access tomorrow, and set up camp for several hours. There is a Starbucks and Costa Coffee in town. The cafe in the park also has internet access. The choice may well come down to whichever has the best atmosphere.

Sitting in a cafe to work at a laptop will be a new experience for me. Will I be stared at in a condescending or envious manner by fellow customers? Will the staff be nice? Will I contemplate using the cafe as a regular weekend haunt away from home to get work done?

Sunday mornings at Starbucks ? Maybe. Maybe not.

For the last two months we have been trying to move our internet service provider at home from Pipex to British Telecom. The main reason for doing so is that Pipex were bought out by Tiscali some time ago, and have been ripping us off for a pretty poor level of service ever since. So far, Pipex/Tiscali have gone out of their way to make it as difficult as possible for us to leave them - we're pretty sure they are breaking the law, but without spending our own money on a solicitor (lawyer), we have no real way of knowing.

The process of moving a broadband internet connection to a different service provider in the UK requires the acquisition of a MAC code from your existing provider. The code verifies your request to move your connection between providers. Pipex claim the MAC code will take 5 working days to generate - which is strange, as one of my colleagues received his by email within an hour when he moved providers.

We first asked for a MAC code from Pipex in February. It arrived in the post after 5 days, and we immediately called BT to move our broadband to them. Apparently the MAC code was invalid. We have been deliberately given an invalid MAC code by Pipex. I called their support department, got through to Bangalore in India, and asked them to verify the code they had sent me.

Me : "Can you verify the MAC code you have sent me please?"

Support : "No Sir, but we can send it again in the post, which will take 5 working days."

Me : "Can you see it on the screen in front of you?"

Support : "Yes Sir."

Me : "Then WHY CAN'T YOU READ IT TO ME" (people behind me in the office looked round)

Support : "Your code is ........" (sounding worried)

Support : "I have just checked the code - it is invalid"

Me : "SO YOU KNOW YOU SENT ME AN INVALID CODE?"

Support : "...." (silence)

Me : "Can you explain to my how I have been sent a code that you know is invalid?"

Support : "No Sir."

I requested a new code be generated, and it be sent again. It never turned up. Therefore I called this morning, and spent three quarters of an hour on the phone with their support department.

To begin with, Pipex claimed that although I was being billed by them, they were not providing my internet connection - apparently some other company called "Power Internet" were. I therefore asked who THE HELL Power Internet were. After much digging, it turned out Power Internet was the engineering company used by Pipex - and they didn't actually know this themselves.

Pipex then claimed that there was no lock on our line, meaning another provider could take over services immediately without a MAC code. I therefore got my other half to call BT (she is the BT account holder), to try it. They replied that a MAC code was still being requested.

I therefore call Pipex AGAIN, and tell them that everything they have told me this morning appears to be false, and can they please send me a new MAC code so I can leave them and cancel my account. Apparently I can call them next Wednesday - ahead of the usual 5 day turnaround - and get the MAC code - which I then give to BT who will hopefully then take over the internet connection, and deliver 6 megabit to our house instead of 2.

Aaarrgggghhh.

Please excuse me while I go and head butt a brick wall somewhere.

Today started at 5:40am, in order to get kids lunches ready, breakfast ready, clear the kitchen, and then get ready for work before leaving at 7am. I didn't arrive home until 7pm.

I have potentially three more days of the same.

Not fun.

As soon as I arrived home, I started washing up, then ordered take-away for dinner while W read stories upstairs, and then got on with more freelance work.

I remarked to a close friend a few days ago - at some point over the next few months I'm going to have to start seriously thinking about what I want to do long term. The web design freelance work is fun, and what's more I know what I'm doing... at the moment my day job is no fun at all.

Of course my current dramas will blow over as I gain knowledge and experience, but gaining that knowledge in front of professional clients isn't the most fun in the world. I feel like a mechanic who is being asked to explain how the biochemistry in fuel works at a molecular level, on an engine I have never seen before.

Just to top things off, I forgot to buy any food today, so didn't eat anything at all until I got home this evening. I haven't told W because she'll go mad.

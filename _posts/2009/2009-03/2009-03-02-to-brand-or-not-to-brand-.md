Over the last eight or nine years I have "existed" in many forms on the internet - a member of Compuserve, a contributor to bulletin boards, a sometime usenet evangelist, a personal blogger, a professional blogger, and a member of countless social networks and instant messaging systems.

Throughout my online journey, I never considered the vehicle carrying my thoughts, words and photographs as important.

Perhaps I got it all wrong. Perhaps I should have a domain of my own - a place that becomes known as "the site where that guy writes who knows all that stuff, and somehow finds time for a family too".

Discovering that people actively follow the thoughts I record and share should perhaps have been a clue. The pure fact that people followed me through changes of web address - from one blog platform to another - should have been an even bigger clue.

I don't know what to do.

If I invest time and effort into growing my own brand - as well as helping others do the same (through my freelance activities), is it not just shouting "ME TOO!" ?

Footnote - I will neither confirm or deny that I may have purchased the domain and hosting for "www.cheeseandbeans.com" while having a coffee earlier...

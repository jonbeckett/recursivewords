I couldn't figure out how to attach the digital camera to myself in order to shoot video on the way to work (I'll probably have to buy a bracket for the bike or something), so I did the next best thing - and got the iPhone out of my pocket every 1/4 mile or so. Enjoy...

Here's W telling me that our clever new car is telling her there may be ice on the ground...

Leaving with the kids for the school run (I ride a mountain bike to work)...

Off through the suburban streets of small town England...

Past big houses where important people used to live - now filled with new media companies...

Some random road junction along the way...

And suddenly we are out in the fields - away from the town...

Into the estate where the office hides in a quiet corner...

Past the trees I have photographed so many times before...

Past the big house where somebody very important probably lived a long time ago...

And finally stood on the steps of the office, looking back down the estate...

In summary, isn't the iPhone camera rubbish!?

After I've booked the old Macbook in for service, it will be mine once more. It is covered by three years Apple Care (which cost a small fortune, but looks like it may pay off), and will hopefully have it's various ills cured.

The old Macbook has done remarkably well, given the hammering it has received. A year of commuting in my hands, and then a year of abuse at the hands of W who filled it with all manner of photos, videos, knitting patterns, and trials of various downloaded mahjong games.

There are battle scars though. It's battery is dead, and doesn't charge any more (the second battery it's had, I might add), and it has cracks on just about every corner of it's facia. If Apple don't just replace the damn thing, I will be amazed.

Of course, privacy being what it is, and the machine having everything about our adoption history on it, we are going to wipe it completely clean before handing it to an Apple Store... and I can't do that until W has transferred whatever she wants over to the new Macbook. Apple have a feature to do that for you (applications and all), but the skeptic in me says that will hose the new laptop. We shall see...

I'll just be glad - at the end of all this - to end up with a Macbook of my own once more.

Then I can bugger off to the coffee shop and sit there with my Macbook, pretending like I'm an intellectual.

In the spirit of sharing, here is a list of ten personal blogs I like. If you're not on the list, and you know I read your blog, worry not - I'll do another one of these lists soon. The selection list wasn't terrifically scientific either - pretty much a case of waving my finger in the air and saying that one, and that one, and that one... now how many is that?

I have been reading most of these blogs for a very long time - so long in fact, that I am suddenly aware of how long it has been since I went on the search for new people to read. If you're anything like me, the blogs you read (or rather, the authors) are somehow just as legitimate friends as those in the real world - those you visit regularly.

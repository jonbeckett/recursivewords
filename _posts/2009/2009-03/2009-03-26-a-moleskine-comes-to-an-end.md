This is the friendly Moleskine notebook that has travelled with me over the last couple of years, being filled with all manner of idiotic ideas, opinions, thoughts and rants about life, the universe, and everything (although you would be hard pressed to find any investigation towards the question behind the number 42).

Figure this out - after two years writing in the book with a fountain pen, I recently started using a drawing pen and discovered that not only is it faster - at least in my hand - but I tend to write more neatly with it too. Go figure...

Of course at some point soon this book will come to an end, and the shiny new replacement will be pushed into service.

The quote on the front of new Moleskine notebooks is wonderful;

The legendary notebook of Hemingway, Picasso, Chatwin

For some reason - and I'm not quite sure if this is by design, or a happy accident - Moleskine notebooks have attained thesame aspirational value as Apple computers. I wonder how many Mac owners also have a Moleskine notebook...

Anyway. There it is.

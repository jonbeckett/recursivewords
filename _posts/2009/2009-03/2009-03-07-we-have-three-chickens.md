Nestled in the corner of our garden, in their own arc and run, are three new additions to our menagerie - three chickens.

I am reliably informed by W that they are a White Star (named "Rosie" by our youngest daughter), an Amber Star (named "W" by our middle daughter), and a Black Star (named "Sophie" by our eldest daughter). I can't imagine I will ever remember their names - they will forever remain "the white one", "the brown one", and "the black one".

We got them from a nearby farm, and the children think they are wonderful. Later this afternoon, after clearing some of the devestation caused by winter from the garden, we will be releasing them from captivity to explore their new world. The biggest surprise so far has been the difference in nature between these chickens and the leghorns we had previously. Where the leghorns would run from you, fly vertically, and were expert escape artists, these are docile, friendly, and inquisitive.

More photos (and perhaps video) will inevitably follow.

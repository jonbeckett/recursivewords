Graze (www.graze.com) and the british postal service combined overnight to deliver snacks to me, so I thought it only right that I should do an "unboxing" post to show you what they sent.

I'm also trying not to sit here and eat it all right now.

The box

It fitted though the letterbox 

Now I just need to explain to W why I've eaten nearly all the peanuts while writing this (she loves seaweed and peanuts, so having the combination will make her do loop the loops).

Of course I'm only sharing this box because W has ordered her own, which will be delivered twice during the week to try and avoid eating so much other rubbish. I might do the same, and take them to work with me.

While people might think this is incredibly extravagant, you try having three kids, a career, and still have time to go and buy/make everything the most efficient way... I am willing to buy solutions to some things.

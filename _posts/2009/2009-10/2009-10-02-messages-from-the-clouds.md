No, I have not bought a copy of "The Cloud Spotters Guide", neither have I suddenly started reading the collected writings of Billy Meier (I'll let you look him up on Google).

My work email has been transmogrified from the company email servers into "the cloud", wherever that might be. I would like to imagine it's something akin to the cloud where the Weatherman lives in the Rupert books, with a kindly benefactor sorting through post bags. In reality, it is far more likely that "the cloud" is a faceless office building in Washington, holding rack upon rack of servers with Microsoft badges on them.

The idea behind my email being stored there rather than here is to protect against loss of service. Again, in my mind, I am imagining a Godzilla like creature stomping across the land, and sitting on our offices with an almighty "WHUMP". The reality is far more mundane... we had two power cuts this morning alone.

Are you still awake?

Okay. Slight scare - and even somewhat related to cloudy internet stuff. I thought my iPhone just bricked itself.

About half an hour ago in a fit of "I wonder if this will work" curiosity I switched Google Mail over to use Google Sync instead of IMAP - basically meaning the iPhone can then annoy the crap out of me and go ding every time an email arrives.

The phone suddenly went dead. Black. Blank. Devoid of life. The buttons didn't work. Plugging it in didn't work.

I'm not completely sure it's what caused it, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was my meddling. I cannot describe my relief when I rebooted it (via a panicked search on the mighty Google for methods to do so) and the apparently dead phone woke back up.

I'm not sure if it was pressing madly at the buttons, or casting multiple colourful curses that fixed the phone. The more scary thought is how dependant I have become on the iPhone. It holds email, notes, calendars, reminders, task lists, photos, and most importantly it can do impersonations of Mr T.

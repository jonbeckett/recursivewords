THEY HAVE ALL GONE!

I have 15 invites left for Google Wave. The first 15 commenters to this post will get them (head to Cheese and Beans if you are reading this elsewhere).

Make sure you put your real email address against the comment - the invite will go to the email address on your comment (it will not be shown anywhere).

 * Note - it usually takes 24 to 48 hours for the invites to arrive

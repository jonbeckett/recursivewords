Isn't it interesting that the UK postal service is branded as "The Royal Mail" when it's a commercial service. Isn't it also interesting that they think they can go on strike.

I know I'm going to be in the minority saying this, but I hate most workers unions. I completely understand why they exist, and in the minority of situations they do have a function. Unfortunately - in the same way that large enough groups of people almost always seem to behave - unions become power hungry, and like to get their own way.

It would do the postal workers in the UK good to remember that they don't HAVE to work for the Royal Mail. Nobody has the right to work for somebody on their own terms - employers pay for you to work for them based on you being able to do a job. It's up to you to accept the terms of that employment, and if you don't like those terms, it's up to you to look elsewhere.

I really hope (if a Royal Mail strike does occur) that businesses start posting packages via other delivery services - it will leave the leaders of their union without jobs, and with very little chance of getting any similar job ever again.

Imagine the interview...

"Why did you leave your last position?"

"I supported a strike that caused the destruction of the company"

Of course I'm expecting some pretty angry replies to this from people who have been exploited by their employers

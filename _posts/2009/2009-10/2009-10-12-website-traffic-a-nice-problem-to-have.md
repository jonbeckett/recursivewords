I received an email from the hosts of Cheese and Beans earlier today, notifying me that on the 12th of the month, I have already over-run the bandwidth limits of my hosting account. In laymans terms, that means "you've got too many damn people reading your blog!"

Of course there is no such thing as "too many people" - what nonsense are they talking about?! I headed off to look at the statistics, and gawped in amazement. Since I began the rather ridiculous feud with my cousin to see who could draw the most traffic to our internet writings, I have actually been trying for the first time in years - trying to write half-interesting posts, and telling a small corner of the world of their existence.

It's amazing what a little effort has done - as can be seen by the graph below;

So - I have a problem - I have to pay more for the hosting (I was previously on the cheap-ass hosting plan). This almost inevitably means talking to potential advertising suitors about them sticking badges down the side of the page, or going with Google Adsense. One this is for certain - I'm NOT going to sell out to the idiots who want links within the content.

If you happen to be visiting this blog, and own a hugemongous advertising company, how about it ? I will never write about any stuff you want me to, but you can have a tiny little badge, and I promise not to make the CSS hide it, or put it right at the bottom of the sidebar.

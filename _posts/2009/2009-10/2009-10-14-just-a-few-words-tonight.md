You find me on arrival home from a walk into town - an eleventh hour dash to procure food for dinner - and a hearing of our eldest daughter reading from a book of her teacher's choosing.

These few minutes are grabbed in passing. A moment of calm delimiting the mayhem of the day; a day filled with the bustle of the morning routine, perpendicular progress at the office, and then greeting stress and further mayhem on arrival home.

Once the little ones are in bed we will return to our adult lives for a few hours, before collapsing into bed as the world tumbles towards tomorrow and it begins again.

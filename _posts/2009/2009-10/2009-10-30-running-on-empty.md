When children get ill, their body does the same thing mine does; hikes the temperature up and burns the virus from their system. The kids have something happen that I don't though - they hallucinate.

Nearly every night this week we have had kids sit up in bed, and scream the place down. Repeatedly. God knows what they were seeing. Of course at some point they figured out that shouting out in the dark caused us to come running. How do you explain to a five year old not to play that game when they are running a huge temperature?

The upshot of all of this has been lack of sleep. On a huge scale. I've been getting to mid-afternoon at work and hitting the coffee nearly every day. Today was perhaps the worst.

Thankfully - apart from the inevitable Halloween parties for the kids tomorrow evening - we have nothing planned this weekend. No doubt the weekend will somehow manage to populate itself with things to do, but at this point in time it's looking good.

Now please excuse me while I go and collapse in a quiet corner somewhere.

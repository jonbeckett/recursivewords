In a repeat of their earlier generosity with "Clerks", Amazon again sent me two movies for twice the price yesterday. This time the movie was "Gamers", which I heard about on a podcast some time ago...

The movie had pretty much everything - moments of brilliance, of abject idiocy, and also of horror when the so-called "comedy" went too far. I was surprised to see Kelly LeBrock turn up - I didn't recognise her until she spoke, and seeing her now made me suddenly feel very, very old indeed. I guess because she hasn't been on the big screen for so many years, you forget how long ago Weird Science and Woman in Red were.

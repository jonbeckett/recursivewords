If you recognised the lyric from the Tom Paxton track, well done. We went to the Cotswold Safari Park with our kids today - the first time myself or my other half have been there since we were about 9 years old, and probably the same gap for my in-laws who met us there. Enjoy the photos (there are far more on Flickr);

See how many species you can name...

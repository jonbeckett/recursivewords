I'm considering setting up a comfy armchair, table, and permanent supply of flasks of tea in the nearby playpark. Despite being off work today with a head full of cold, I still found myself sat out there this afternoon when our youngest returned from school (to allow my better half to get anything done at all).

After a few minutes of falling off everything in the playpark, I made a suggestion;

"Shall we go home for a hot drink now?"

"Okay Dad... and a biscuit"

By the time we got home, it had turned into "Dad said can have biscuit". Crafty little madam.

We really need to stop referring to the coat in the photo as "The porn star coat" too - she's going to ask for it by that name in front of somebody else... you know, like the headteacher of her school.

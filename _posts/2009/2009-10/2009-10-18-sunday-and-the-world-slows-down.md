For the first time in weeks, I am being afforded the opportunity to spend Sunday doing what I want. This is so rare it seems like something of a novelty.

Most people in their right mind would be out doing cartwheels around the house, eating junk, watching television, drinking fizzy drinks, and otherwise being a slob. I'm configuring my own web server, reading technical books, and monkeying with stuff.

It doesn't help that our youngest didn't really sleep last night. At one point (at about midnight) I heard "noises" drifting down the stairs, so went to investigate. I discovered little miss 4 sat in the middle of her bed, a cuddly toy in each hand, singing a song to them. I coughed to announce my presence and she threw them down the bed, and fell back like a tombstone - pretending to be asleep.

Coffee. I need coffee.

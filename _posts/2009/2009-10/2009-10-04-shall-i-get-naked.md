If you arrived here via a search for something rather questionable, I'm sorry to disappoint you. This does involve nakedness, and showers, and lots of giggling - but it doesn't involve anything naughty at all (well... apart from mine and my other half doubling up with laughter, which could be something to do with the implied meaning in the question our five year old came out with).

They had just arrived home from swimming, where the queue for the showers had been long enough for Mum to make an executive decision - they would be having their showers at home.

I was in the bathroom, switching the shower on when she arrived in the doorway, and asked the question in the title;

"Shall I get naked Dad?"

I burst out laughing, and so did she - in the same way that small children do when they laugh with you, but don't really understand why everybody is laughing. It will be one to remember when she is older - to recount in front of her friends. As I drew breath, I heard W doubled up with laughter in the kitchen, and our eldest laughing like a particularly loud thing in the living room.

Little miss 5 seemed delighted that she had made everybody laugh, and had a smile like an upside down coathanger.

It was her first go in the shower at home. After climbing in with her shoulders tight to her ears, she started doing a happy dance, and shouting "IT'S RAINING!".

One of my oldest friends online (she has a blog here) messaged me this morning, asking if I had heard of "Graze" - and I had to admit I had not. The photo above appeared in my email shortly afterwards from her.

It turns out Graze is a new company in the UK that sends out healthy snack packs that will fit through your postbox - therefore the normal postal service can deliver them. You can choose from all manner of things (dried fruit, nuts, etc) to go in the box, or take the easy option (I did) and just choose a diet plan. I was looking for the Lex Luthor style "give me EVERYTHING" plan, but the nearest is a "balanced diet" plan. Like most food delivery services, you can go through everything they might send you, and tell them if you like it, don't mind it, or hate it.

If you are a greedy guts, you can have them delivered every day. A box costs typically just under 3 ($4.50ish for US readers - although you can't order it anyway - sorry!).

Given the deplorable postal service in the UK, I suspected this might be the Achilles heal of the service, but they even seem to have thought of that. On breakfast television this morning, the UK postal workers were threatening to go on strike (again) - Graze have already responded, and will be substituting all fresh fruit until the risk of a postal strike has gone away. I'm impressed.

When my first box arrives, I'll take some pics, and write more. Lets hope this is one of those good ideas that turns out to work well! I suspect our local postal service will do it's normal trick, and the lazy ass postman will drop a card through telling us "this item was too large to carry, please pick it up from the sorting office at a time completely unsuitable for you."

Head over to http://www.graze.com if you are interested. It's worth noting that I am NOT connected with "Graze" in any way at all.

For the past few weeks I have been investing a little more effort into the words and pictures I contribute to the world you and I know as the blogosphere. It has reminded me why I love blogging - and indeed writing.

It's all about spending time with myself - listening to my own music - writing my own words - sharing my own pictures. Consuming content, and generating new content.

Life has a habit of sneaking up on us from time to time, and the unimportant consumes us. No matter how selfless we might like to be, we forget the most important thing to look after is number one - ourself. It pays to invest - to find something for yourself, that belongs to nobody else.

Your thoughts below to you, and you alone. The words you share are a manifestation of those thoughts, and as such are a piece of you shared with the passing crowd.

While immersing myself back into the world of those who blog - who share their life and thoughts online - I found myself thinking about commenting; about their importance or unimportance. After worrying for some days that comments could be seen as a form of attention seeking, I realised something.

Feedback from the passing crowd reminds us that we are not all the same. The differences make people interesting - without them our stories, views, and opinions would hold no interest. While this inevitably opens the door to deliberate controversy as a platform building technique, it also invites us to find like minded people.

Concordant feedback leads to the affirmation that you are a part of something bigger than yourself - that you are not alone in your thoughts and opinions. You're not quite as weird as you perhaps thought.

Weird is good though. Everybody needs to embrace their inner weird sometimes. The really weird stuff is always the most interesting, and yet typically it is only discovered by those closest to us - those we share our life with.

If you happen upon this philosophical navel examination of a post, thankyou.Thank youfor taking the time. Now go embrace your inner weirdness, and share a little of it with the world. The world will be listening.

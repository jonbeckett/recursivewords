Like most workplaces, we each draw from a collective pool of mugs in the kitchen. The various drinkingreceptaclesare emblazoned with an assortment of long dead or defunct company and product logos. I can't help feeling that I should somehow be striving to be more individual - to have my own mug.

After working here for so many years, have I really become such a slave to the corporate machinery that I put up with whatever is available - whatever is given away by the mighty overlords for free ?

I used to have my own mug. One I got for free. With a long dead company name on it. Ah. I see the flaw in my own behavioural history here.

The most obvious places to acquire a mug would seem to be;

ThinkGeek (with a risk of import tax)

Caf Press (make my own mug)

Zazzle

The next question is perhaps more important - how much can I get away in terms of lude, suggestive, or colourful signage ? How far can I go before I receive the phone call from the human resources manager to "pop up for a chat".

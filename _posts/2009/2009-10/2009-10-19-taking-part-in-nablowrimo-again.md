I will be taking part in NaBloWriMo again this year (also known as "National Blog Writing Month") - the annual challenge to write a blog post on every day throughout November. It sounds easy, but I can assure you from years gone by - it's not.

The first few days are great fun - writing about the minutiae of each day, sharing your annoyances, your joys, and perhaps a few private thoughts. You quickly begin to wonder if things are worth sharing - and conceal more and more.

Of course NaBloWriMo is aped from the rather famous NaNoWriMo - National Novel Writing Month - an annual challenge to write a 50,000 word novel during November. I attempted it last year, but life and work conspired to make it impossible.

The one great thing that does come out of NaBloWriMo is new friends. Of all the fellow bloggers I now read, virtually all of them came from past Novembers, taking part in the forums, and reading the various blogs of others taking part.

If you have a blog, why not think about it. If you ever find yourself thinking "I should write about this" while dodging the slings and arrows of your day, now is your chance. Make November memorable - you know you want to.

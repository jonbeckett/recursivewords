It's strange to think that the previous generation of games machines is now thought of as "Retro", but apparently it is (ask any ten year old).

I succumbed to the charms of E-Bay last night and ordered Jak and Daxter for the Playstation 2. We still have the console, and stacks of games for it, but this one game - "Jak and Daxter" - is the only one we've got rid of that I really miss.

The danger of course is that the arrival of Jax and Daxter through our letter box will cause mountains of washing up, ironing, and general devastation to occur around the house. I know from experience that if I even miss one evening of clearing the decks, the house (aided and abetted by three little maniacs) destroys itself in short order.

E-bay is dangerous. Even though it has become a glorified market, populated almost exclusively with "real" shops, I just never learn. Boredom + any free money = junk I didn't need through the post.

Of course I need Jak and Daxter (like a hole in the head, but still...).

Don't even get me started on The Legend of Zelda. It won't be pretty. We're talking "not even answering the door" levels of idiocy not seen since I was a student.

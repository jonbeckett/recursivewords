While making the very important decision about what to have for a first drink of the day, one of my colleagues (who has been attempting to detox a little) proclaimed "F*ck it! It's Friday!", and chose coffee.

I'm not quite sure when coffee became the evil choice, but my bizarrely sidetracked mind immediately started working on the possibilities of using our new label.

Twitter already had the idea of follow friday - this would seem to be a natural extension of that, but I'm not entirely sure how one might use it. Perhaps mistakes of the week should be owned up to on a Friday, with the hashtag displayed - fckitfriday ?

Perhaps not.

You might gather from the general tone of this post that my week is drawing to a close, and you would be right. I worked straight through lunch today, so could officially wander out of the door right now. Given that I will be mounting the bike, and it rained torrentially ten minutes ago, I will be waiting a while - lest I swallow more puddles and wretch my way home as happened in the week.

I wonder if "F*ck It Friday" extends as far as ordering pizza for dinner ?

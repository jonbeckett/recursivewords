What is it about Fridays? Where does our energy and enthusiasm go?

I was going to write a long post filled with bitterness, complaints, and general curmudgeonly pearls of spite. You might even call it "foaming invective". Mid-rant, I realised that nobody would be at all interested in listening to my protestations, so I hit the delete key and held it down for quite some time.

Let me summarise that which I would have written if the "attack of sensible" had not happened;

I have lots of things I would like to do

I do not have enough time to do any of the things I would like to

The thing is, I quite like moaning. I'm good at it. I get in a temper with myself all the time - protesting internally at my private annoyance of the situations I commonly find myself in. The external manifestations are generally fast stomping around the house, heavy handedness, and refinement of a flustered look.

How do you deal with the every day slings and arrows ?

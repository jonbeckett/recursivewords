When I was young my Dad went on a business trip to Germany, and came back with a toy (from the Frankfurt Toy Fair?) called "Big Loader" - this was at least 30 years ago. Imagine my surprise when some friends of ours offered to give us a toy their children had grown out of - Big Loader. We had the smaller set of the two we have now acquired, but the memories it has brought back are priceless.

Isn't it wonderful to see further generations of children enjoying the same toys we had when we were young. Who needs video games ?

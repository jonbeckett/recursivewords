This morning finds me on the London train once more - for the first time since I stopped commuting for a project last year. It felt very strange preparing to leave the house this morning - memories of returning to school after the summer vacation came back to me. What time is the train? What time do I need to leave? What do I need in my bag? Being on the train again is strange too - many of the same faces are sat around the carriages - including Mrs Handbag, busy shovelling her makeup on. She has the dress sense of an armoured car. In a strange way I've missed this time on the train each morning. Time to reflect, time to think, time to wake up... Sent from my iPhone

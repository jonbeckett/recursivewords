Back when twitter was shiny, new and horrendously unstable, it was also interesting; or rather the people who frequented it were. Popularity heralded the arrival of the marketeers though, and with them the idea that twitter could somehow be used as a marketing tool. Over time, people who had been writing interesting, open and honest posts read too many articles about monetising their twitter presenceor became self proclaimed experts on social media.

It is therefore with some dismay that I am going to go through the hundred or so people I follow, which I had already decimated a few months ago, and cull still further.

Over the next few days, if anybody shares something thoughtful, interesting, or personal, they will go into a "safe" list. Friends will of course go into the safe list too. At the end of these few days, everybody else will be unfollowed.

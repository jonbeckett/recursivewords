It's been a mental week.

Following Monday night, when I fell into bed at 3, and got up at 6, yesterday and today have both been commuting days; so up before 6, clean the house a bit, catch train, return home by about 7pm, wash up.

The last two days have not helped my nerves eithergoing "on site" with work always makes me feel like I'm being tested. In many cases customers know more detail about the software they are using than I do. Granted, I might be able to write software to completely pervert most productsbut users often know workarounds for just about anythingand some of them are damn clever. Tomorrow I am heading into the unknown again. Off to another client, to help do something rather clever that I've never attempted before. I will be packing my laptop, along with virtual machines, development environments, and other such goodies, and will do my best. That last sentence probably caused 75% of readers to switch off. All 3 of them. I'm listening to some crap or other on Spotify. "The Music of the Band"a compilation album.

Tea. I need a cup of tea.

You might imagine I would have worked out how much sleep I need to survive on by now, wouldn't you. You would also be wrong.

I vaguely remember looking at the clock at 3am this morning, shortly before my body decided it was ceasing activities for the day (or rather the next day). I believe I was listening to Newton Faulkner at the time on the Nano, having just decided that "This Week in Fun" was the most annoying podcast I had ever triedI guess I just don't get certain shades of American humour. I wonder how much coffee will be required to keep my eyes open throughout the day? I also wonder how I'm going to get through the remainder of the weekeach day will be spent commuting to client projects in the early hours, and returning lateand then of course I will face the inevitable mixture of chaos and mayhem at home. If you're wondring what I was up to until the early hours of this morning, go take a look at "Chicken and Cheese" http://www.mychickencheese.com- [http://www.mychickencheese.com&/#8211]; it's the personal blog of a journalist that I'm proud call a friend.

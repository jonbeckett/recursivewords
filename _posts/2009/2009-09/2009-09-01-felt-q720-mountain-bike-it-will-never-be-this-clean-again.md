Fresh out of the boxthe first photos of the Felt Q720 mountain bike I took delivery of earlier today.

After tightening everything up and adjusting a few things, I took it for a first ride up and down the road; indexed gears worked perfectly, brakes feel very soft (it has hydraulic brakesfirst bike I've had with them).The distance between saddle and handlebars seems a little further than my old bike, and the seat post will raise a little higher.After riding it to work tomorrow I might have a few more thoughts. Initial feeling is good. See and download the full gallery on posterous

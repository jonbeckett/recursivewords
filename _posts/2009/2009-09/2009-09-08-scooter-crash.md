While walking to school this morning, our 5 year old had the kind ofscooter crash that Barry Sheene would have been proud of. It seems tobe pre-programmed into all children below a certain age to staredirectly at the floor when propelling a scooter. Little Miss 5 foundout the hard way why we have told her a thousand times to "LOOK WHEREYOU'RE GOING". Doing a little arithmetic, given the speed she was travelling at, andher estimated eye line, she probably had about about a tenth of asecond to react to her little sister's scooter appearing in her fieldof vision. Of course she didn't react at all. Walking along behind,all we saw were her legs fly in the air above her head. Then the volume got turned up to 11. After dusting her down, and examining the impressive scratch acrossher thigh, she relectantly got to her feet, and started walkingtowards school - really slowly, and with lots of sobbing andcomplaining while holding her skirt up so everybody could see herscratch. And her knickers.

I arrived home last night a little early to help out with our eldest daughter's birthday party. It seemed like a simple enough idea for a birthday; 3 friends, movie, and junk food. For some reason our circle of friends and various parents were wishing us luck with eyebrows raised.

I have news for all the doubtersit was easy. I didn't really sit down between 5:30pm and midnight last night, but that's pretty normal; I think I washed up about six times. That's pretty normal too. A few observations from the evening and morning;The playpark never gets old. In order to entertain our younger children while the party girls made t-shirts, I dragged them over to the green outside our house. A few minutes into the mayhem, two of the party goers appeared, followed by the rest. Little girls want to be big girls. It's the way of the universe. While running around the playpark in their party dresses, one commented to another "you look really grown up!", answered with "thanks!" oh dear. The loudest child is always the most insecure, as evidenced by the one who's Mum we had to call at 11pm last night to pick her up.

The appeal of SpongeBob Squarepants is universal.

You know the little girls who look like ballerina's? They look like that because they don't eat their dinner, and re-define the term "fussy eater". I am quietly thankful that our girls will eat hotdogs until the cows come home. Since when did 9 year old girls "not drink fizzy drinks" ?!? (yep, that will be the ballerinas)Little girls will lie about their staying up prowess. They all fell asleep by about 11, and slept like logs through until about 7:30 this morning. They claimed not to have gone to sleep at all (if only I had recorded them led all over each other in their sleeping bags). Would we do it again? Of course. But not maybe for a few weeks we like to have some weekend too. See and download the full gallery on posterous

We went out for dinner last night at Bangkok Lounge in Bourne End to celebrate surviving 8 years of marriage without killing each other. Apart from being the only people in the entire restaurant all night, we had a great time. It was nice just to sit, talk, and have no arm tugging, no repeated trips to the toilet, and no requirement to tell anybody off.

After much looking at the menu, we ordered the vegetarian set menualthough anniversary meals are supposed to be for both of you, everybody knows in reality that it's all about the woman. Like most men I'll eat just about anything (and am often chided for treating food as "fuel"), so not having a plate full of some beast chopped into strips wasn't really missed. You would think our conversation might have been a little more wide ranging, given the absence of the children. You'd be wrong. We talked about the kids pretty much all nightabout school, their friends, upcoming birthdays, the other Mums and Dads we need to make more of an effort to get to know, school teachers, handwriting, maths you name it. W wrote in our anniversary card that she doesn't deserve me. I don't think she does eitherI'm a nightmare lol

I have been meddling with the various places that I hold accounts on the internet this eveningtrying to bring the same username into effect everywhere (as much as that might be possible, given the lack of planning that went into the mess I have singlehandedly created). While doing so, I thought it might be a sensible idea to keep an online backup of my entire personal blogso grabbed  http://jonbeckett.wordpress.com [http://jonbeckett.wordpress.com/]. A few minutes later it was populated with my old blog postsif you would like to know how I did it, feel free to email me.

The basic idea going forward is that I email posterous, and it hits  http://www.cheeseandbeans.com [http://www.cheeseandbeans.com/], and the wordpress blog (and Facebook, Twitter, and LiveJournal, but that's another story).

Holy crap. It's nearly midnight where did the evening go ?!? (again)

Should 2am be regarded as "last night", or "this morning" ? Whatever, it's the time I finally rolled into bed last night. This would have been find had a small child not awakened me at 6:30am. I peered across the bedroom in the dark and saw a ghostly small figure at the end of the bed."Can we go downstairs and put the television on?""It's too early"Little person quietly walks back into her bedroom, and bellows to her sisters "IT'S TOO EARLY". I woke the next time at about 7 in response to some kind of bed gymnastics championships that was going on across the landing. Thumps, crashes, barked instructions, and occasional explosions of gigglinginterspersed with the odd thud, silence, and apology. It's now mid afternoon of course, and I'm taking a break from work (trying to get my head around multi-threaded events and delegatesbest not to ask). I'm experiencing the inevitable mid-afternoon dip in energy following lack of sleep. I know it's my own fault. Part of the reason for going to bed so late was that I had earlier in the evening come across the devestation that is our bedroom, and hoped somebody else might go to bed firstand therefore get the task of finding the bed under the piles of clothes and shoes. Coffee. I really must go and make some coffee.

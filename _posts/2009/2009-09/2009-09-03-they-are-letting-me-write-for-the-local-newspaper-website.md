It would appear that I have been approved to write for the local newspaper website. I'm not quite sure at the moment what I will write about - they appear to have given me an open remit. It's not a paid job either, but I can't help thinking it will help draw traffic to other things I am involved in, and will get my name out as somebody who can sometimes string a few words together in a pleasing manner.

A good friend remarked the other day that I could always take up a career as a writer, and of course the truth is that I would love to write for a living. I'm guessing that actually writing as a career is far more difficult than the idea of writing as a career. Churning out interesting and thought provoking stories that don't libel or slander anybody is going to be a huge challenge. The paperwork I have to send in to the newspaper reads like the ten commandments - "thou shalt not spout unproven, or unverified facts", and so on.

Oh dear.

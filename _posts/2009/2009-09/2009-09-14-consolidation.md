After being incredibly impressed with Posterous over the last few weeks, I have decided to jump ship for my regular blog (that very few people read anyway). Maintaining a wordpress installation of my own wasanother thingto worry aboutand at the moment I can do with those like a hole in the head. If you areone of the very few people who read me, you will still be able to follow me through the means you always haveat least for the moment. The various addresses and feeds still work.

One of the great things about Posterous is that I can throw posts out into various clouds on the internet (Tumblr, WordPress, LiveJournal), and automagically maintain a "live" backup of sorts. Attached images even find their way into both Flickr and PicasaWeb. I do nothingI just email post@posterous.com. In other news, I just called home and found out my iPod Nano arrived. Expect stupid videos to be posted this evening.

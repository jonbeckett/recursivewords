This evening I have been implementing a new theme on a WordPress blog for a friendand as anything of this nature would naturally dictate, I completely lost track of time. I looked up and it was 2am. It's now 2:30 and I'm sat in bed with the Macbook, listening to a podcast.

There's no way I'm going to be able to sleepthere's too much stuff running around my head.

Sometimes I wish I could switch offoften when presented with "free time" to do something else (play video games, watch television, listen to music), I will choose to do something related to my freelance work; reading up on HTML, CSS, PHP, Drupal, WordPress, or Joomla.

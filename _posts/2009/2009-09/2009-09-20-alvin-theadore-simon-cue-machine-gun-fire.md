I just got back from a trip to the shops accompanied by our youngest, and was subjected to a barrage on 4 year old thoughts about life, the universe and everything for the entire duration of our trip. Given that the walk takes 20 minutes on her little legs, that's about three quarters of an hour of brain dump.

Inbetween buying various foods for lunchboxes, we visited Blockbuster and picked over their carcass (if you've been reading the news, you too will know that Blockbuster, along with any other movie rental chain are about to be destroyed by the coming of the internet). We came away with the following movies;Alvin and the ChipmunksBabeBridge to TerebithiaMr Magoriums Wonder EmporiumGuess which one the kids are sat watching? (the title is a hint). My memory of the Chipmunks is a 7 vinyl single that was handed down to me when I was young (along with a Dansette record player), where they all sang "I want to play my Harmonica", and drove their human counterpart (and much of the audience) mad. I lasted about 30 seconds into the movie before eating my own feet, and left the room. I can still hear them from the other side of the house. It's like a cruel form of torture.

I have no idea why this piece of music appeared in my head earlier this evening. Perhaps the 1980s music festival we went to is to blame. Who knowsAs far as I know, Freiheit only had this single hit outside of Germanyand at the time everybody was whispering "Wings", and "Paul McCartney" in the same way that they mentioned "The Beatles" when Oasis first appeared in the late 90s.

There's something more escapistmore hopefulabout music from the 80s. Enjoy.

We sat down last night and watched the movie "Bridge to Terabithia", rescued from the bargain bin at our local movie rental store. The cover sold it as "from the studio that brought you The Chronicles of Narnia", so we imagined a light hearted fantasy movie. Boy were we wrong...I'm not going to ruin the plot if you haven't seen it. I will say that the critics were surprisingly accurate and positive - several asking why more children's movies can't be as grown up. It brought both W and I to tears, and I imagine most other parents too. Of course the Amazon reviews were completely polarised - from over protective lunatic parents threatening legal action to open minded parents who thanked the movie makers and couldn't heap enough praise on it. Our nine year old is going to love it. All kids who don't fit in will love it. All adults who didn't fit in when they were kids will love it. Younger children will lose interest within the first half hour, so don't worry too much about them seeing it.

I'm not actually sure if the next few days of my professional career can be regarded as adventure or not. Of course, given the usual constraints on that which I can share, and that which I cannot, I cannot tell you where I am going, or what exactly I am going to be doing. I can probably share that it involves computers, and a higher level of knowledge than most of a very narrow field of expertise. That means I'm king of the nerds, doesn't it.

It's a weird experiencebeing regarded as any kind of "expert" at anything. The term "expert", or "evangelist" has no qualifying popularity or competence level. Just as a scientist might be an expert in nuclear physics, I could be an expert at washing up, or putting my socks on. Evangelism. Now there's a concept. Feeling the need to impress upon others that an activity is worthwhile in the hope that others might also do it. The dictionary definition looks something like this; Sharing news of something in order to convince someone to join or otherwise accept it. It's the word "convince" that unsettles me. Whatever happened to freedom of thought? I'm guessing freedom of thought means anarchywhich may be why religions have been promoted by most ruling powers in the developed world since the dark agesfear, uncertainty and doubt are easy methods of controlling the populance. What am I saying here? Not much. I'm just waiting for a file to downloadand while doing so, managed to crank out all this crapand if you read this far, you can give yourself a hearty pat on the back. Just think of all the useful things you could have been doing instead of reading this.

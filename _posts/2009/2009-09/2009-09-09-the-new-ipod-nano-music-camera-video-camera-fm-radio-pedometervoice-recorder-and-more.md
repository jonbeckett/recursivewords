I just finished watching live coverage of the Apple press conferencein the US, and immediately following it went to the online Apple Storeand ordered a new iPod Nano. Where to start with the new Nano? It's cheaper, it has more memory, it has a video camera (640480,30fps), stereo microphones, it has FM radio (with live pause!),pedometer, and more. It's crazy. This has probably doomed a number ofcompeting products on the market - especially as Apple announced thereturn of the LP - they will be selling bundled media in the iTunesstore, replicating the kind of content we remember from the days ofgate-fold albums - photographs, lyrics, and background informationabout the album. The same goes for movies - you know how a movie typically comes withspecial features or extras? They do on iTunes now. I can't helpfeeling that we'll be buying an Apple TV soon, and selling our entireDVD collection. Given the number of times we ever re-watch movies, thehundreds gathering dust on the shelves are becoming more and moreredundant. The new Nano though... it's brilliant.

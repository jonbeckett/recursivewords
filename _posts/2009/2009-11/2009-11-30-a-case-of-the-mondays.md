After sitting down at my desk to begin work this morning, I couldn't help thinking about the scene in Office Space;

"It looks like you've been missing a lot of work"

"I wouldn't say I've been missing it..."

Of course the crazy thing is I am here - I always turn up. Rain or shine. I often think about not turning up, but some invisible force pushes me out of bed, makes me have a shave, and I find myself at the office, booting the computer to begin another day of headbanging.

I am away again this week - staying in the Hilton again (you know, the big posh hotel with crap rooms and no WiFi). I guess I should reserve judgement; we could have very nice rooms this time. If I don't have to walk the length of a football pitch to reach my room I'll be happy.

p.s. I'm trying out posting by email - if this comes through garbled to hell, it's totally my fault.

The more eagle eyed among you will notice the "subscribe by email" thing in the right hand margin - WordPress switched it on today, so I'm trying it out. If you sign up, you'll get my various utterances through email (as if you haven't heard enough from me already)...

I'm heading out in a bit for something to eat with my colleagues - we're all a bit bored of hotel food now, and think a visit to nearby Solihull will be tremendously exciting (can you detect the sarcasm?). The team staying over tonight has been halved; we are starting to think of ourselves as the stalwarts; or rather - the ones actually busting their ass to get the project done.

I talked to the girls at home a few moments ago, and heard a madcap condensed version of their day. Inbetween the splashes, screaming and shouting (they were in the bath), I figured out that little miss 5 was off school, but only poorly enough to stay quiet until lunchtime... following that she experienced a sudden infusion of energy and has been told she's going back to school tomorrow.

Ho hum. Better go and have a wash I suppose.

You know the photo I took the other night of Jupiter and it's moons?

Today curiousity finally got the better of me, and I installed a rather wonderful application called "Stellarium" on my netbook, to figure out which moon was which. Rolling back the clock to about the right time-frame that we were in the back garden, the magic box of tricks tells us the following (click on the pic for a bigger version via Flickr);

From left to right, they are Callisto, Europa, Io, and Ganymede.

It also occurs to me that I should have pointed out that the pictures from the telescope are of course upside down and back to front - it's a reflector telescope!

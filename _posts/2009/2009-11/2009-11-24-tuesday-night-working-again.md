It's Tuesday night. I'm sat in the hotel working again. I just stopped to bash out a quick post in order to keep going with NaBloWriMo.

I'm not going to bore you (if you're reading this) with anything about work, apart from the main reason I'm working all hours is to avoid thinking too much about being away from home.

When I get back into the hotel on an evening, the first thing I do is connect the netbook to the internet, fire up skype and say hi to W and the kids. I'm always greeted by smiling faces, and it instantly wipes away the cares of the day.

While cycling home from work this evening it struck me how clear the sky was; signalling not only the coming of winter, but also of opportunities to get the telescope out once more (or at least, to get the telescope out at a sensible hour).

After dinner each of our children trooped out into the frosty air of our back garden, and took a look at the Moon, and Jupiter. Only the eldest really understood what she was looking at - I think we may now have an amateur astronomer on our hands.

While doing it, I pointed our tiny point-and-shoot camera down the telescope eyepiece. Hardly scientific, but the results were pretty spectacular;

The Moon

Jupiter and it's moons

Apologies for the camera shake, and lack of focus - through the telescope they are pin sharp, blow-torch bright, and incredibly impressive. I really must buy a camera mount, and a manual focus lens.

(For the technically minded people out there, the telescope is an F8 4.5C/3 Newtonian reflector, and had a 15mm eye piece in)

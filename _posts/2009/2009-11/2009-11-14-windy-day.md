Little Miss 5 accompanied me shopping today to buy clothes and wash bag stuff. We also had to choose a birthday present for her friend's birthday party (she's there right now). On the way to the shops the following conversation happened...

Me - "How are we going to find the party?"

Her - "You are going to drop me off"

Me - "But I don't know where it is"

Her - "Mummy will tell you"

Me - "What if Mummy doesn't know ?"

Her - "Mummy knows everything"

Quite a responsibility - knowing everything...

With days left to go, I didn't post anything yesterday. Crash bang wallop indeed.

I'm back in the office at work today, clearing paperwork, getting expenses paid, and sorting the various minutiae out. This afternoon will no doubt be back to the grindstone, neck deep in Javascript, Webservices, .

NET and Microsoft SharePoint again. My work is going well though, so I can't complain.

I arrived home from another 4 day stint on-site last night in time to put the children to bed. As is the usual pattern of things in our house I actually arrived home to an empty houseit suddenly occurred to me that Thursday night is Brownies night. I set about washing up, tidying up, and putting things away, and had just about finished when the rabble re-appeared. Little miss 4 immediately ran to me for a hug. No shouts, no laughingjust a hug.

It's good to be home. The spectre of another 3 weeks of this madness remains though.

Starting at some point next week, and for the next six weeks or so, I am going to be "living" in a hotel during the week. Thus far I had only considered the impact on the rest of my family, but it occurred to me earlier that I'm going to be living in a hotel! What on earth is it going to be like?

People only live in hotels in the movies, and on television. Real people don't do it, do they? (okay, okay, they probably do, and they are probably contractors, just like I will be).

Will it become lonely? Will I get to know the staff? Will I go absolutely raving mad ?

One of my colleagues wondered earlier if we will end up heavier - if the daily routine of hotel breakfasts, lunches and dinners will have an effect. The obvious solution - at least for me - will be to spend time in the gym most evenings. I never watch television any more, and podcasts only last so long. I forsee many, many miles on running machines.

The internet will of course provide a link to home, and to my friends. My children and better half will catch up via webcam each evening, twitter will record thoughts during the day, and this blog will share the wider story.

I took delivery of a new backpack today, big enough to carry my work laptop along with any other stuff I might include to occupy my evenings. I'm thinking Nintendo DSi, a good book, the iPod Nano, and the netbook I'm using right now.

I wonder how many days it will be until I leave the shackles of the hotel of an evening and explore the local area; maybe venture into the nearest city for dinner?

The movie "The Terminal" has come to mind in recent days; I am going to become a version of Victor Naborski - except this version will have a family to look forward to on weekends.

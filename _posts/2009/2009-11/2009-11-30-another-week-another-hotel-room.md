I'm starting to get the hang of this - not living in a hotel - I'm starting to get the hang of expecting failure. Don't get me wrong - this hotel room is nice, but there are little things that could so easily have been right. It's a big Hilton, if that means anything.

Let's start with checking in, when the girl told me exactly the wrong direction to go. I half suspected, and asked a porter in the corridor - who smiled, told me I wasn't the first to have been given such instructions, and pointed me in the right direction.

Next, there's the wardrobe in the room, and it's coat hangar. That's right - singular. Whoever stayed in this room last stole all the coat hangars. I guess it's no accident that other hotels have hangars without hooks, but it still doesn't excuse the staff from putting some back.

What next? Maybe the kettle and it's 1ft flex, which requires IQ test logical abilities to plug in and keep using the desk.

Other than the above, the room is good. It will be my home for the next 3 nights, and rooms like it will house me for the next 3 weeks. It's no accident of course that I plan on camping out at the desk most evenings. The rest of the room that I'm so busy complaining about is of little real use to me.

A question therefore comes to mind; what would your ideal hotel room have in it? What do you require ?

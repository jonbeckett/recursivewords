It's Wednesday evening - the third night in the hotel - and I'm slowly getting used to it. If the old saying about not missing what you never had is true, I'm starting to forget what I once had. Perhaps that explains my acquiescence ?

After the trials of the first night, the 3G dongle on the netbook has performed like a champion - giving steady connectivity from the hotel room. It's not fast enough to handle video on Skype, but it's enough to read the news and reply to emails.

While sat in the hotel restaurant this evening with my colleagues, the architect of the project turned to me and said "this is the last time we're going to be eating here". I looked blank. It turns out the restaurant we are in delivers a package three course buffet meal. All well and good, but not the same as picking something from a menu.

Although I have complained about the restaurant, it has been fun to eat things we don't normally have at home; herring, sea bass, salmon, prawns, and countless other cuts of meats that take hours to prepare, and that children will not go anywhere near.

This evening I trooped off down to the hotel gym again. The injury I sustained chasing our girls around the local woods is still preventing me from running, but didn't stop me cycling. I may well rest it completely over the coming week so I may run again. I can cycle too easily - as evidenced by my huge legs - which makes it the "easy option" that does me no real good.

If you'll excuse me, I have a bag to pack - I'm checking out in the morning, and will be heading home tomorrow evening.

I can't tell you how much I'm looking forward to seeing my better half and the children. I know I don't say it very often (at least in this blog), but I love them all to pieces. This week - and the prospect of many like it to come - is hard.

Monday night, and I'm sat in a hotel once again. This hotel is not as grand as the previous one from the outside, but the rooms are infinitely better.

The restaurant is great (not as upmarket, but the food is very good), the bar is nearly HALF the price, and everything seems to work.

I have quite possibly the widest bed in the history of hotel beds - I could probably sleep across it, and not hang over the sides (quite a feat - being over 6C/2 tall).

The evening has been taken up with working - rather than sit in the hotel room contemplating my navel, I am trying to get my portion of this project done as fast as possible; meaning hopefully that I can get ahead of the development curve - and perhaps back to my family a little more quickly.

The massive saving grace of this hotel is that the 3G signal is STRONG - meaning the 3G dongle on my netbook is nearly as fast as broadband. That saves me 20 for the hotel wireless broadband for the week...

Perhaps I should draw up a calendar like we do for the kids, and cross the days out as they pass.

I'm home from my first stint working away from home.

Arriving home, the house was empty, and I ended up doing what I had joked with a colleague about - washing up. A little while later there was a knock at the door, and two very sleepy little girls greeted me at the door.

No cheers, no jumping up and down.

I read their stories, and then I gave their Mum a huge hug.

A little while later their elder sister arrived home from brownies - this time there were excited cheers, hugs, and kisses.

It's great to be home.

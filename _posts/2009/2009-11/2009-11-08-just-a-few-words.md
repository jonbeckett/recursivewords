It's 11:34pm on Sunday night, and I'm scraping inside the deadline for NaBloWriMo (I have to post every day this month to get away with it). I know I could alter the times/dates of posts, but I would still know I had cheated, which would drive me mad.

I found myself back in town today with our eldest, while the younger children went to various birthday parties. We saw the new version of "A Christmas Carol" at the cinema in 3D. Movie was absolute rubbish, but I was very impressed with the 3D bit - first movie I have seen in 3D in years. The technology has moved on a lot.

Other news? As part of the enormous decluttering effort going on in our house, I bought an Apple TV box. We are selling nearly all of our DVDs. The thought has also crossed our mind to rip every CD we have, and put them in a box in the loft. They sit on the shelves in the lounge for months on end... there is no reason for it.

Next on the chopping block could well be the video games machines gathering dust in the attic - pretty much all of the retro games consoles are up there, along with their variously famous games... a NES, a SNES, a Megadrive, a Saturn, an N64, a Gamecube, an XBox, a Dreamcast... you name it, it's up there. The reality is that I just never play games any more, and the kids are not interested. I guess they might be one day, but I wouldn't bet on it - the presence of video game stuff all over the house has pretty much taken the novelty out of it, and given their background they always choose games and activities with us over the television every time.

Anyway... I'm off to sit and watch rubbish with my better half for an hour before crashing into bed.

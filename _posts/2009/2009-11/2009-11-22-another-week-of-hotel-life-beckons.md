Sunday night is ticking down, my bag is packed, and I'm more or less ready to head out again. Following a late night of coding on Friday when I was seemingly able to solve anything and everything, I am actually looking forward to the work this week. I'm still not looking forward to being away though.

I'm taking half as many clothes with me this week - and therefore half the size bag. It's funny how quickly you learn what is needed, and what is not. Of course the Nintendo DSi is absolutely needed.

How boring is this blog post? I have nothing interesting to report really; I worked ALL weekend, therefore no interesting stories, anecdotes, or observations.

Note to self. Must try harder.

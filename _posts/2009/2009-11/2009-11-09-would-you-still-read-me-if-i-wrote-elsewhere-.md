Those who have read my various writing online will know I have had blogs at pretty much all of the more noteable hosts - WordPress, Blogger, Tumblr, Posterous, etc - and of course I have hosted my own blog - most recently here at Cheese and Beans.

Having come "full circle", it's become obvious that the platform doesn't mean anything. Neither does brand building. Personal blogs are all about us - people - our shared experiences.

I really don't know any more what to think - what to do - or even if to do it at all.

There is a thought in my head at the moment that November 2009 could be the end of me writing a personal blog - or at least a regular one. At the moment it's a scary thought, but it isn't preposterous at all.

The kids didn't fall into bed until about 9:30 last night, and somehow recharged their batteries sufficiently after a night of mayhem to wake up at 6:30am. How do they do that ?

Last night was of course Halloween, meaning we dressed the kids up in various costumes representing the dead in order to beg sweets from friends houses. In reality, we spent most of the evening at W's best friend's house with various activities being thrown at the assembled children - the most entertaining of which was doughnut eating races (hanging from string, no hands allowed).

This morning the kids are eating their booty. If we were sensible parents we would be rationing it, but I don't think a blow-out now and again does too much harm, so we let them eat whatever they want - with the warning "when it's gone, it's gone...".

I'm sat writing this in the playroom. Every other room of the house had something going on in it this morning; this was the only sanctuary. I can hear some kind of christmas card making/sticking/gluing happening in the lounge, and a certain 4 year old singing songs in the bathroom.

Today is the first day of NaBloWriMo and NaBloPoMo - wish me luck.

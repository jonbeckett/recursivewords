The last few days has heralded something of a resurgence within meI have stories to share for the first time in ages. Perhaps it comes from a recent attack on the blogroll mountain.

With a memory now filled with the stories of others, my own are bubbling up from the depthsthe stories I had deemed insufficiently noteworthy now seems ripe for picking.

Today's story relates to just a few moments yesterday evening. The children were in bed, our babysitter had just returned home (we visited school for a presentation on an outward bound course next year), and we were relaxingat about 9pmfor the first time since we got up.

I handed W a big bag of kettle chips, and a glass of wine. She looked up at me, and said "put Big Bang Theory onI need something funny that requires no brain power".

The next hour was spent in the company of Sheldon, Leonard, Penny, Howard, and Rajeshenjoying perhaps the most entertaining television show I have watched in years. We have come to know the characters as you do old friends; each has their own insecurities andidiosyncrasies. The genius of Big Bang Theory is the failings of the characters make them more likeable.

In one particularly memorable scene last night they were deciding between going nightclubbing, or visiting the comic book store. They ended up at the comic book store.

Before we knew it, the wine and chips had gone.

My blog is back at WordPress - hosted by their good selves rather than me. I haven't so much gone "full circle", as started another lap. Hopefully this will be the last.

After thinking about it all afternoon, and much of the evening, a few things occurred to me;

Why am I paying for blog posting ?

Why am I not using WordPress.com ?

What kind of idiot am I ?

I'll tell you what kind of idiot I am - the kind that can't stop fiddling with stuff - can't stop tinkering. It has to stop some time, and now would be a good time. After trying out all manner of homes for my words around the internet, I am returning to the once-host for many moons of them - WordPress.

I do not write to make money - therefore I have no need for advertising. I am in the business of making friends though, and it makes much more sense to be part of a community to do that. Better to be on the train, looking out, than on the platform trying to look in.Hosting my own WordPress blog highlighted many of the professional dangers I have to deal with in my "other life" - constant updates to the server, constant re-installation of plugins and widgets, and constant defence against spam. That all comes to an end through the use of a hosted blog - it becomes somebody else's problem.

Here's to the future, and being a boring ass blogger on WordPress, who throws out badly written words like confetti in the dark of night - that nobody can see.

It's mid afternoon on Saturday and I'm pretty much wiped out. Today was the day of the primary school Christmas Bazaar - and W was roped in to creating and helping run Santa's Grotto. Yep - you got it right; in the middle of me being away 4 days a week, we have been roped into helping with everybody else's crap. On top of that we have no money to buy the kids anything for christmas, and no time to scratch our own backside.

Here's a few pictures from the playpark earlier anyway...

Please excuse me while I go fall in a heap somewhere (that will be the heap before I make the kids dinner - like last night - then my better half's dinner - then do the bedtime routine). By about 10pm I should be able to do some freelance work... just like last night, and probably every other night in the runup to Christmas.

I can't remember the last time I sat down and played a video game, or watched television. I wish I could.

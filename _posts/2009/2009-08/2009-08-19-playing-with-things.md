The license for Remember the Milk just came up for renewal, so I am taking another look at "Things" for Mac and iPhone - a nice task list application. Things has something of a reputation as a pretty application (many Mac and iPhone applications are) - it reminds me in many ways of the entire Apple experience; the same task can be performed by cheaper alternatives, but the user experience is invariably inferior... I very much doubt that Things will make me any more organised or efficient - but at least my lists of things to do will look pretty.

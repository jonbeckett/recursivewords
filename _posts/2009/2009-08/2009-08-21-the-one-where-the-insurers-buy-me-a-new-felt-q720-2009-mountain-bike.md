My faith in the world in general has been repaid somewhat this afternoon, following news that our home insurers are paying out on the mountain bike I had stolen earlier in the week - and following a like-for-like comparison, they are buying me a slightly better bike than I previously had.

The bike is a Felt Q720 2009. I have to admit I had never heard of Felt before, but a little research on the internet turned up a fairly new company that typically makes bikes that I will never be able to afford - carbon composite creations with exotic alloy parts.

My requirements for a bike are somewhat more modest - if it will get me to and from work for a couple of years without falling apart, it will pay for itself. If it stops my belly from hanging over my belt, it will also have paid for itself.

Originally spied on the wonderful blog "inProgress" (http://kassota.wordpress.com), this seemed like a lunchtime sized activity to partake in. Random confessions... - I forgot to let the chickens out this morning. We have three chickens in our garden - it's usually my job to let them out on a morning, feed them, fill their water, etc. My other half released them from the overnight prison of their arc (read: very small shed). - I got sunburned to buggery while playing with our kids in the sea last week, but didn't tell anybody because I knew they would have a go at me for being so stupid. I felt like I was on fire for about 24 hours. - I often stay up late to avoid tomorrow. Stupid, I know. So there you go - some random confessions. If you post some, please throw a comment, email, or message in my direction so I can be nosey too

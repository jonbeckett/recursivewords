It's Friday morning, the sun is shining, I've had two cups of coffee, and the day ahead looks good. The kids have had their breakfast - I just need to go jump in the shower and have a shave. I think we may be off to some National Trust place today - Pensomethingorother, or Trewhatsitsname. Having said that, I just looked outside, and the blue sky has turned to thick cloud in the last minute - it's now bucketing down with rain. Wonderful. In some ways the rain is good - it means the kids spend more time with their grandparents. The 300 mile journey means they don't get to see them very often. We now have horizontal rain. What's next? Brimstone?

I hadn't been off work sick since the girls arrived with us 18 months ago. Thanks to a wandering cold virus that chanced upon me and grinned wickedly, I am at home doing combat with it, and have lost my record of non-sickness. Dammit. I was sent home on Monday amid fears of the Swine Flu outbreak.

Yesterday lunchtime I stupidly thought I was getting better - and ended up with a headache that felt for all the world like my head had been split in two, along with an accompanying earache.

Today I find myself in a ridiculous situation - not feeling too bad, but not being able to look at the computer for too long because it causes the headache to return. Figure that one out.

At least it's not the Flu.

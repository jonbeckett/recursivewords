While hunting around the Moo Cards website, I happened upon "Timbuk2" - a company that makes bags...

It didn't occur to me until I started fiddling with the site a little that they don't just sell bags - they let you design your bag, and then make it to your specification... you choose the materials, colours, what straps you want, what liner you want, what dividers you want... even what colour embroidered badge to put on it.

Yes, they are expensive, but imagine having a unique bag, made to your own specification... I need to remove the bookmark and never go there again, out of fear that I'll end up clicking "submit order" before I know it.

If you are stronger willed than I, go visit www.timbuk2.com and take a look.

This morning I find myself back at my desk, in the office of my employer for the first time in many months - with no immediate prospect of leaving the office. A few weeks of intense study and learning will be required to integrate myself back into the work being undertaken by my colleagues. Spending the last two years on a parallel track has left me with very different skills than they have.

A meeting this afternoon (if it happens) will hopefully furnish me with the roadmap for my immediate future - in the meantime I am putting my digital affairs in order; filing emails, clearing junk, and trying to become a little more organised. My experience of the "Getting Things Done" methodology over the last year may become useful in the weeks ahead as I juggle studying, working, and life outside of work.

While "at work" I am of course on-line all day, so if you are a member of any of the instant messaging or social networks, feel free to give me a shout - here's the requisite identities;

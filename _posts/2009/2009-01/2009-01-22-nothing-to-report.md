While not revising for another Microsoft certification exam tomorrow, I have been wondering what to write a blog about today. The "common sense" part of my brain is telling me that if I have nothing to write, I shouldn't try to do so.

Perhaps it's time to crack out the drawing paper and start drawing the people I promised to the other day.

Just to finish ourselves off in spectacular fashion, we took the kids to the farm today. They love it, and get to feed the various animals, experience "real" sights, sounds and smells, and perhaps learn something inbetween diving around on the bails, climbing on climbing frames, and hand feeding rabbits and goats.

Please excuse me now while I go and collapse in a corner somewhere.

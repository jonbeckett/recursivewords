I've been working late this evening on a freelance web development project - I can't show you the actual project yet, but I can give a hint through the graphic below;

With the freelance work starting to fly in once more, Microsoft exams looming at work, and family life becoming more hectic, I really need to start simplifying. I've been looking at BackPack, and the various Zoho offerings again tonight, and still haven't settled on changing anything. I suppose I should be thinking about stopping doing things, instead of finding replacements.

I sit down in the morning to do a Prometric Microsoft certification exam - that will take me half way to becoming a "Technical Specialist" (I'll take the other half in a couple of weeks time). Although it will entitle me to add "TS" after my name in business correspondence, I'm not going to. If I do one more exam after that, I get to be a "MCPD", which carries far more weight in the industry. Of course, me being me, I'm then going on to do 2 more exams - both for SharePoint in order to add even more letters. I have to pass the exam tomorrow first.

It would be tempting to sit and go through some more test questions before turning in for bed, but I don't think any more information will go in at the moment - I could swear I scratched inside my ear earlier, and programming code fell out.

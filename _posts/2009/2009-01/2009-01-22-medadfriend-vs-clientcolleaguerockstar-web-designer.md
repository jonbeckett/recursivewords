I have taken the next logical step towards the seperation of "Jonathan/Dad/Friend" and "Colleague/Client/Rockstar Web Designer", and acquired a phone number specifically for my professional self.

For those of you who follow such technology, it's perhaps the first step down from an iPhone (which I already have) and a Blackberry - an LG KP500 "Cookie".

There are some interesting features on the phone itself, such as it's flash based interface, and three dimensional desktop. It's touch interface is quite nice, but the haptic touch screen is nowhere near as good as the iPhone - the amount of pressure needed to "swipe" makes it more or less useless. Perhaps mindful of this, a stylus is included in the base of the handset.

Syncing has so far been very good, with an export of contacts from MobileMe in VCF format importing relatively trouble-free to the LG bundled phone management utility. In the longer term, I may well start using Microsoft Outlook purely for contact and calendar synchronisation - a solution to be discussed in more depth another day.

I have updated the contact page at Beckett Web Design with my new number - 07929 197016 - and edited my profile at LinkedIn too. Now I just need to remember where else I have my "professional" phone number listed.

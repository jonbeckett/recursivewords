I've been working away for the last couple of evenings to design and build a new theme for WordPress. It's name thus far is "Subminimal" - I have no real reason for the name - it just sounded good when I thought of it. At the moment, my freelance work site "Beckett Web Design" has the new theme, and it's about time too - it's pretty difficult to convince people you are any good at this stuff unless you can demonstrate it. I think this theme demonstrates it pretty clearly.

There's a lot I still want to add to it - things like popular posts, and a tag cloud, but it's coming along okay. If you're wondering why it's such a "corporate" looking theme, it's because that's it's intended market - companies. Although I might be proved wrong, I can't see a personal blogger using it as their normal blog theme.

Perhaps a personal blog theme will be the next project. Who knows... of course my next job will be to package this up and make it into something other people can download and share. That will mean boring chores like testing, documenting, committing it to version control, and providing some community tools to support it. I'll have to keep telling myself that this is going to be fun!, honest!

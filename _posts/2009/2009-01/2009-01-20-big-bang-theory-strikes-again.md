This is getting bad. We're on our second episode tonight. I'm not sure how many we have left... and I'm not sure what we will watch when we run out.

Phew. Just checked. There is a second series.

In other news, one of my oldest and closest friends started writing a blog today - a real, proper blog on the internet - here's the URL;

She's one of the best writers I know. Enjoy.

I promise there will be no further posts about Big Bang Theory. Honest. I know it's starting to sound like a scratched record.

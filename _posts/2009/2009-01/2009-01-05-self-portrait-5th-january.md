Taken this evening after getting in from work, washing up a mountain of dishes, putting all the kids through the bath, putting them to bed, reading their stories, and finally getting half an hour to myself.

Click on the image and then "all sizes" in Flickr to see the bigger version. Taken with a Fuji J10 (little point and shoot camera), and then thrown through Photoshop Elements where the background was selected and a median filter applied. Also used the touch up tools to get rid of a lump on my neck.

One day I'll post a step by step to cleaning up a photo - if anybody would like to email me a photo they want cleaned up, feel free.

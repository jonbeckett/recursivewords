It's Saturday morning, and I'm knackered. I've been up since 7:30, and all I did so far was wash up, and clean the kitchen up.

I would dearly love to spend the day knocking around the house doing quiet things (rather difficult with three little girls waging war from room to room), but instead find my schedule organised for me. While little miss four (nearly five) goes to a birthday party, I am required to take little madam eight, and little miss three to the big play park in town - and possibly for something to eat in the cafe.

I'm not sure how other parents deal with it, but I always worry about the inevitable when you take the kids out single handed - at some point the youngest is going to pipe up with "need toilet" - so what do you do with the elder child in the meantime? Last time the park was quiet, so I risked leaving her in the cafe for the minute I was gone (after asking the staff to keep half an eye on her). It a problem all parents face at some time or another, and I'm sure everybody copes differently.

A trip to the toy shop is also in order for our youngest to get something special - she managed to get through the night last night without a pull-up on for the first time ever. We're sure there are going to be all kinds of accidents over the next couple of months, but if we heap enough praise on her, she'll get the idea.

I need to go have a wash - it might wake me up a bit.

How on earth do the kids switch on so quickly - they seem to wake up and hit the ground running. It takes me several cups of tea, and a good hour these days before I'm ready to face the world.

p.s. hopefully the R4 will arrive today, and bring more games to my Nintendo DS than I ever dreamed of - which of course is stupid, because I never get time to play it anyway...

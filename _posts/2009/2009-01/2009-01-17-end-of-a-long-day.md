It's been a long day. As arranged yesterday evening, I gave Wend a break today and took the kids off her hands as much as possible.

This morning started with breakfast, getting them dressed, and then getting them out the door while their Mum had a long asked for quiet bath upstairs using all the posh soaps and oils I got her (from the girls of course) for Christmas.

We headed off to the big park in town, and had several hours of fun and hilarity in the playpark, watching the swans, ducks and geese on the river, and then feeding our faces in the park cafe (cheese melted over chips is a favourite of all of our children). Next stop after the park was the big supermarket in town for emergency supplies - cereals, bread, and milk. We seem to get through gallons of milk.

We pass a florist on the way home, and I suggested we get Mum some flowers too (the girls already knew the reason we left Mum behind was so she could have a rest). The next few minutes were spent going around the various buckets of flowers choosing small bunches of various colours - with me guiding but trying not to over-rule the children's decisions. The only thing I really said no to was roses - knowing that W would much rather have lilies (and besides, roses are a complete rip off).

We finally arrived home at about 2pm, and the girls lined up at the doorstep to greet Mum as she opened the door - and our eldest piped up with "We got you these Mum because you are the best Mum in the world"... it was all Wend could do not to burst into tears.

This afternoon my brother in law came over, and I volunteered to do washing up, bath and bedtime routine to again give Wend a chance to get out of the house without the kids in tow. She's presently at the pub with her brother before heading to the Indian restaurant on the way home to pick up our dinner... which reminds me - I need to convert the playroom into a bedroom for him to stay this evening!

Better get cracking - they'll be home soon!

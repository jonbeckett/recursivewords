It's 2009! Just handed the phone over with my parents - now talking to W. Just wanted to wish everybody who reads a happy new year.

Good health, and everything else you're supposed to wish upon those you know and love, and all that kind of stuff.

I need to be going now - appointment with a bottle of Sherry.

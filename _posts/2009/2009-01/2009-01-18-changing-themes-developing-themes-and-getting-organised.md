If you're wondering why I changed back to "The Journalist" theme on my personal blog, it's purely because it's easy to read, and it doesn't get in your way - not that I write anything worth reading, but there you go. Oh - quick reminder - if you have a bookmark or link pointing at www.ewows.net, it won't work at all soon - the hosting expiry is in a few days time and I'm not renewing it.

I'm trying to make time today to tweak and polish the "Subminimal" wordpress theme I have been working on in order for it to be approved for the WordPress Theme Directory - once that is done, a lot more eyeballs should get access to it. As with any project, the devil has been in the detail - and it's been reassuring to know that standards are upheld before themes are allowed into the directory - the initial theme I submitted was returned with quite a few requested changes - all of them minor, but important none the less.

In other news, I signed back up for BackPack on the internet on Friday night, but have not had a chance to populate it with useful information yet. It is already aggregating all of the Google Calendars I need to, and holding the early planning for W's birthday. I like that Backpack isn't too targetted in it's application - it's a loose set of tools (to do lists, notes, files, reminders, calendars etc) that you can use however you want. The ability to email content into specific pages is great too - it suits my laziness / productivity geekishness perfectly.

This afternoon will be filled with attempts to entertain our youngest while the elder two go to their swimming lesson. I will walk into town with her - I need to get some instant coffee for my own sanity, along with my not-so-regular trip to buy shampoo, deodorant, shaving stuff, and so on. Has anybody else noticed how men buy one of something (e.g. they have "a bottle of shampoo") whereas women have a whole shelf full of various different flavours, types, and styles of the same thing in the bathroom?

Right. I better get on. After real life subsides today I have a web design gig to get on with - which will take me into next week and the whole chaotic ride starting all over again.

Hope you're having a great Sunday, and give me a shout!

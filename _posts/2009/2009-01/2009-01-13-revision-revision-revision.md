I've been busy revising for a Microsoft exam all weekthe .

NET Foundation exam. I've been doing all the practice papers I can get my hands on, and so far it looks like I'm getting about 90% scores.

I dread to think what I would be like if I returned to college nowI would be after 100% scores on everything. I guess once you have worked in the professional (or open source) world for long enough, you don't like accepting anything except the correct answer for anything.

Testing for a programming language is weird anywaymost development environments actively help you to code these days, so knowing the various classes and methods available isn't actually that useful.

Being immersed in such boredom inducing study means that very little has happened in my life today worth commenting on.

Outside of my work, the freelance stuff has started to pick up once morewith several projects waking up on the same day. We are in need of some money at home to help dig us out of debt, so at least I have a reason to be putting the hours in.

I wish we had a chocolate vending machine at work. I'm starving.

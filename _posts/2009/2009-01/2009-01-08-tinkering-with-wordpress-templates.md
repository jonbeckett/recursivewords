As the first step into a much longer journey, I have been teaching myself the nuts and bolts of WordPress theme creation tonight - and in doing so have re-imagined the Beckett Web Design website. I've fiddled with pre-built themes in the past, but never created one from the ground up.

The general plan is to build some basic themes to give away, and then set to work at making some premium themes for sale - really nice ones.

If you're anything like me, you often waste hours looking for a half decent theme, and end up giving up 90% of the time - or just settle on the latest theme that Smashing Magazine is giving away. It struck me recently that I have all the skills and talent required to make themes for WordPress and Joomla, and wondered why I was not already doing it.

Well now I am. Watch this space.

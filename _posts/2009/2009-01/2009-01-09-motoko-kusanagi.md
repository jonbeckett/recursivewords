While waiting on the phone the other day, I found myself looking at the drawing of Motoko Kusanagi (character from Ghost in the Shell) that I drew last week - and it started bugging me that it didn't look like her.

I changed the line of her chin ever so slightly, and carried on shading it in, and what do you know - it now almost looks like her...

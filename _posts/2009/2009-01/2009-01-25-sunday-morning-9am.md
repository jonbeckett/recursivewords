It's Sunday morning, it's raining outside, the kids are watching Harry Potter on the television in the playroom, W is sitting quietly sipping Rooibos tea in the living room, and I am holed up in the study.

I'm bringing a virtual machine and several technical documents online to begin belated work on a freelance contract that I should have begun yesterday. W being ill has landed the children and housekeeping chores on me for the weekend - not helped by our five year old being invited to multiple birthday parties this weekend, and the car being out of service at the moment. Thankfully her itinerary doesn't require me until mid-afternoon today. Of course sods law dictates that the rain is coming down like stair rods outside - and we will have to walk right the way across town to her next party.

I'm wondering how she will take not going to today's party.

Okay. The first paragraph took a minute to write. It's now 9:40. This is how things work around here at the moment. The simplest five minute tasks like writing a blog post end up taking an hour because a hundred requests to do things get thrown at you, or you have to marshal little people, stop arguments, reprimand, or otherwise tidy up behind the entire family to avoid a complete descent into chaos.

The end result is a five minute blog posts takes an hour.

Next task is to go and negotiate a tidy up of the bedrooms - they were tidy last night, and now they look like a recreation of Little Boy being dropped.

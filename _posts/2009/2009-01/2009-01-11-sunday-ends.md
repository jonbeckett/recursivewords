It's the end of Sunday evening, and I'm sat here wondering what to do with myself for the remaining hour or so of the weekend before I crash into bed. I would be chilling out with the Nintendo DS, but my other half has taken it over for the last few evenings (even though she has one too). I'm guessing when her R4 cartridge arrives, I'll get the DS back.

For those wondering what on earth I'm talking about, the R4 is a cartridge that you plug into a Nintendo DS that in turn accepts a micro SD card - which you can fill up with the ROM images of other game cartridges or homebrew software on. It turns the DS into a multimedia player, and lets you carry all your games around without carrying the carts with you. We are seriously thinking about selling all of our DS games as a result - although I wonder if they are actually worth selling. One thing in our favor is that all of our "bought as new" games are in A1 mint condition.

This raises a bone of contention for me actually - I regularly buy second hand video games from the likes of "Game" and "Game Station" - sometimes for the children, and sometimes for either myself or W. I am continually shocked at the condition some second hand games are in, and wonder why people buy things in the first place if they are not going to look after them... I have music CDs that are 15 years old, and have no scratches what-so-ever on them. I'm not so sure it's a question of upbringing either - I know several people who are markedly different than their siblings with regard to looking after things.

While writing this, iTunes is busy downloading podcasts for me to listen to throughout the week. The iPhone has become something of a crutch for me (although it needs to go back to the shop to be replaced soon - something has gone wrong with the connector at the foot of the phone, causing it to see imaginary devices all day long). Finding time to listen to podcasts is interesting at the moment - although with my other half seemingly absorbed in the world of Professor Layton in the Nintendo DS at the moment, I have more time than I have had for some time.

This post is going nowhere, is it... I should stop writing. So I will.

Given that I spend an inordinate amount of time online, and have therefore amassed a somewhat embarrassing level of knowledge in terms of "what can be found, and where" on the internet, I thought it might be worth listing a few of the websites I find myself visiting during the slower moments of the day.

I'm purposely not listing the "obvious" candidates, such as Facebook and Twitter, because many people have them open anyway.

The Onion

Imagine a newspaper that really was completely and utterly made up (yes, I know most of the tabloids are too) - The Onion is perhaps the standard that all tabloid journalists aspire to.

BB Spot

Riding on the coat tails of The Onion, BBSpot can be incredibly entertaining - notable story being the one reporting that Jennifer Lopez's ass had exploded (she had "too much junk in her trunk" according to an onlooker).

Digg

Digg is a huge directory of user submitted "interesting stuff", where the most interesting is voted to the top of the heap by the community. The highlight of Digg is without doubt "Diggnation" - a video podcast recorded each week by Kevin Rose and Alex Albrecht looking at the top user generated stories of the week - while drinking copious amounts of alcohol.

Slashdot

Subtitled as "News for nerds, stuff that matters", Slashdot reports various technology related stories, and is perhaps most entertaining for the bitch-fests that follow disagreements in the comments - if given enough comments, all threads end up with "who would be win a fight between [insert comic book hero] and [insert another comic book hero]".

So there you go. A few links to help you out when you don't know how to spend the next half hour. If these don't suffice, ask again - my capacity to waste both my own time and the time of others is without equal.

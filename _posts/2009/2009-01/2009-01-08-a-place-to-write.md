After returning to WordPress a couple of days ago, and writing "Life and Times" after a year long sabbatical writing elsewhere, it feels strangely comforting to be back. It's a place people know as being "mine" on the internet - even if it is hosted by WordPress.

The reasons for a return to WordPress are many and varied, but it basically boils down to two things - I'm cheap (WordPress is free), and I'm lazy (I no longer have to update the server with patches).

The quality of my writing will most likely not improve at all - if anything over the last year or two it has degraded due to lack of time and/or motivation to construct anything worth reading. My writing has become much more self serving than before - rather than being here to share, I am more or less talking to myself to avoid insanity. That's not to say I don't like getting comments - I do - I just feel guilty for not always spending enough time reading blogs of people I have in the past, and commenting on their scribblings.

Actually, scribblings is a really bad terms to use - but it sounds much better than "typings".

On a different note, I just had an email from a lovely lady downstairs that she has brought biscuits in that she was given at Christmas to share - to avoid getting fat. So apparently it's fine if we all get fat. I guess if somebody else gets fat, then that at least obeys the conservation of mass law... although, if everybody ate biscuits, does that mean we all get heavier? Surely that then causes the earth to get heavier, and drift off it's orbit ?

If I was ever going to have a falling down moment over something trivial, now would be the time.

Here's the basic facts behind my annoyance;

I have an iPhone

I have an LG Cookie mobile phone

The iPhone contacts sync with MobileMe OR Outlook

The LG Cookie syncs with Outlook

I want to sync both phones contacts, but I don't want to use Outlook

I have several computers that I wish to sync with the phones - not just one

I have several calendars (in Google Calendar, and Backpack) that I wish I could sync with the phones - that's not going to happen either

You would think - working for a systems integrator as I do - that I would be able to wave a magic wand and make all this stuff play together. But no... well, I could, but I'm not willing to spend hour upon hour of my free time writing some kind of framework to glue things together.

I don't think there is any kind of sensible solution short of duplicating entries all over the place.

One day the kind of standards compliance the web enjoys will permeate contacts and calendars, and we'll never have to go through all this crap any more.

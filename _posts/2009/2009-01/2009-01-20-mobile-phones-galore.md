With the impending trip my iPhone is going to make back to Apple (it's borked), I will have to survive with an alternative mobile phone for a couple of weeks.

The choices are the old T-Mobile K800 that I am about to cancel, or the ancient Orange Nokia 6310i that I am going to keep (it's on "pay as you go"). I'm edging towards the Nokia purely because I remember the 6310i handset as the best I ever had - it lasted WEEKS on a single charge. Contrast that with the iPhone that lasts a day or so.

I may make a trip to an Orange stockist soon to see if I can get an upgraded handset for the Orange account - even though it is "pay as you go". The 6310i was good, but I would love to have a good camera on at least ONE of my phones (the iPhone has a spectacularly shit camera).

While charging the various handsets earlier, I was reminded just how good the camera was on the K800i - 3.2 megapixel with a proper lens and camera controls... and the photos show it too.

Hmm... I'm off to our local mobile phone shop website to see what I can get.

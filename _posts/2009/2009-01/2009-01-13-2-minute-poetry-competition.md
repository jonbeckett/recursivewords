While kicking back, drinking our coffee, and putting the world to rights, myself and a colleague invented a rather fetching poem...

Descending into the Depths of Hell

Riding my bike, ringing it's bell

Smoking some golden beans...

... I fly away

After ad-libbing alternate lines, we commented that it wasn't exactly Keats.

Work is often far closer to JPod than I would like.

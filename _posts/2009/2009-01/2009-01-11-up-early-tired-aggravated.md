I have been up since 7:30am today (Sunday) after the kids all woke up and started making a noise like the house falling down from about 6am onwards. I didn't actually get much sleep because my other half is becoming nocturnal - particularly so last night after I showed her the "Professor Layton" game on the Nintendo DS. I fell asleep at about 2 o'clock, but she was up later than that even.

On a different note, I watched "Remember the Titans" last night - the American Football movie with Denzel Washington. I really liked it, but as somebody who lives in a multi-cultural society it was incredibly difficult to watch. I'm guessing portraying such bigoted, idiotic, hateful people is difficult for actors too. The worst part about the entire movie is of course the knowledge that widespread racism still exists in most countries of the world.

It's strange really - although prevention or racism is regularly focussed upon in the media, how come the worst cause of injustice in the world is not treated in the same way... Religion?

I have to finally admit - and I don't talk about this much either in this blog, or to any of my friends or family - that I have had enough of religion. I used to say I "sit on the fence", but continually witnessing the pious, sanctimonious views of those who claim a faith as some sort of badge of superiority over non believers and/or believers of anything different has pushed me over the edge.

I am a logical person, and every logical bone of my being tells me the same statement that has been plastered over 800 buses recently is true - "There is probably no God. Now stop worrying and enjoy your life". People with a faith in a religion will no doubt remind me that 85% of the people in the world have faith in a creator. This is part of my entire objection to their views - what if 85% of the people in the world are WRONG. As far as I have ever figured out, religion is a pyramid scheme to further the cause of the most corrupt organisations in human history - and it does this by preying on the emotionally vulnerable using escapism and fear.

I once had an interesting conversation with a devout Christian - where he admitted that if looked at through my eyes, and my proposed argument - that I was much stronger psychologically than he was - because I required no set of beliefs to answer questions for which I or the world has no answers yet.

Before you write me an essay in response to this post, let me repeat - "stop worrying and enjoy your life."

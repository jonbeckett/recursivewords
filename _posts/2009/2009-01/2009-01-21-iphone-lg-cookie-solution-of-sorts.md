At some point over the next few days - possible this evening - I am going to replace my venerable old Nokia pay-as-you-go phone with a more modern handset. After a quick look around on the internet, the LG Cookie looks like the most obvious candidate at the moment.

The real reason for doing it is to separate business from pleasure - while the iPhone is my personal phone, I do not have a company mobile (neither would I want one - they are horrendous HTC Windows Mobile handsets) - so end up using the iPhone for everything. This opens up the possibility for work to call me at and any time of the day or night - or while I am halfway up a hill on holiday (as has happened several times in the past). I'm also not happy about having my personal phone number on my freelance website.

With the advent of me doing freelance work, it makes sense that I put a clear line between "me the person/Dad/friend", and "me the colleague/client". Being able to easily sync contacts, calendar appointments and work email with the phone would be nice too - hence needing to move away from rather jurassic Nokia.

If there is a reason I am so tired this morning, it's not just because I was watching back-to-back episodes of "The Big Bang Theory" last night - I was also playing GRID on my Nintendo DS. It's kind of crappy, but it reminds me of Mario Kart, except with semi-realistic cars (although how you could argue anything is realistic on a Nintendo DS is anybody's guess).

I've played the DS more in the last week or so than I have in months - it makes a welcome break from revising for Microsoft certification exams. I just wish the muscles in my hands were as deft at pressing buttons as they were 20 years ago. Within twenty minutes my fingers typically cease working and refuse to do what I think I'm telling them to. That's my excuse anyway.

After several years working with the Microsoft .

NET platform, I have finally been afforded time at the beginning of this year to sit down with the books, study, and hit the exam trail. After taking two exams in the past couple of weeks (detailed below), I am now officially a "Microsoft Certified Technical Specialist".

Here's the two exams I passed;

70-536 Microsoft .

NET Framework "Application Development Foundation"

70-528 Microsoft .

NET Framework 2.0 "Web Based Client Development"

While I'm pleased I now have the certification under my belt, I was somewhat shocked at the lack of real-world development skills tested by the exams. I'm wondering if Microsoft will ever unleash a "design patterns" exam, to test the way a developer approaches problems, and develops solutions.

Perhaps making a judgement about somebody's actual skill as a developer is far too expensive to test in any kind of sensible manner. As an example, the systems integrator I current work for has a "first hurdle" programming test for new applicants using any language you like on paper. I obviously can't give away the test questions, but they are heavily based in classic computer science problems (and therefore the world of design patterns).

I digress. I am now a Microsoft Certified Technical Specialistmeaning I can add the letters MCTS after my name in business correspondence if I so wish I think not somehow. If colleagues who know my past history with all things Linux and Open Source are to be believed, the acquisition of Microsoft certifications signals the completion of my descent towards the dark side.

Fear notwhile not working on .

NET projects, I am still studying the various developments in the world of PHP, Python and recently Ruby, and nothing is going to change that any time soon.

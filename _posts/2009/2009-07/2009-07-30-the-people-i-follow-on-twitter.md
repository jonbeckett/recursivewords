While tinkering with some javascript earlier, I thought it might be fun to scoop out of twitter the various users I follow, and assemble them all in one post - a rogue's gallery of sorts. Initially I planned to make it a static image, but then thought where's the fun in that! - so now it's clickable. If you really want the javascript that did it, email me (details are on the contact page).

Enjoy snooping

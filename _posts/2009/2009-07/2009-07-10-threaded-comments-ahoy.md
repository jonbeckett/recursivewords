I took a few minutes out this lunchtime to implement threaded comments on this blog. WordPress has been able to do it for ages (since version 2.7) - I just couldn't be bothered with the hassle of doing it.

It basically means comments can be made on comments - so a conversation can happen... not that my blog posts ever result in conversation (or comments), but at least it's there.

I bought the first series of "Fullmetal Alchemist" at the weekend. I've read a couple of the Manga books in the past, and thought it was interesting. For those who know nothing about it, here's an extract from the synopsis on Wikipedia;

Set in a fictional universe in which alchemy is one of the most advanced scientific techniques known to man, the story follows the brothers Edward and Alphonse Elric, who want to restore their bodies after a disastrous failed attempt to bring their mother back to life through alchemy.

It's a diversion from the only previous Anime I have watched - the various Studio Ghibli movies, and Ghost in the Shell. Having only watched the first episode, it's very different - more childish than Ghost in the Shell, but the story is perhaps just as complex.

I'll write more about it when I've watched some more.

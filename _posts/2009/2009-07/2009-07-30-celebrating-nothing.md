While reading somebody else's blog last night, I realised that my own personal blog isn't actually about anything in particular. If you read any of the published wisdom about blogging by the likes of Darren Rowse (of ProBlogger fame), in order to be successful, a blog should concentrate on a niche - a subject.

Does the absence of a specific subject doom my personal blog to mediocrity and anonymity? Probably. Do I care? Nope.

Sometimes the most interesting things to read about are the little things; what we may regard as normal, humdrum or boring may be very different indeed from another person's normal, humdrum, or boring.

I would therefore like to celebrate all the blogs that aren't about anything in particular - the posts that contemplate the minutae and the meaningless. The little differences between ourselves, our lives, and the places we live are what make us interesting.

Could I really be arguing that "nothing" is interesting? Perhaps...

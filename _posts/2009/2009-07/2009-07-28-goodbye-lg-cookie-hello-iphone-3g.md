For the last several weeks I have been using an LG Cookie mobile phone - the one I bought to use for freelance use - in place of the iPhone which had developed an intelligence all of it's own, and required a brain scan back at Apple's secret underground facility (I believe most phone shops have a secret hatch in the floor that leads to the Apple mono-rail).

This is where I begin the foaming invective.

The LG Cookie is without doubt the worst mobile phone I have ever had the misfortune to own, use, or put up with. Why do things with one click when they can be done with four? Why have a keypad on the screen when you can hide it under a button press to get to it? Why not lock the user out after 2 seconds of not touching the interface? You can't even delete recorded messages via the interface... or call to listen to a message via a button anywhere...

I had not realised quite how much I would miss the iPhone - it's just a phone after all... it calls people.

Of course I had started to use the iPhone for far more than just calling people. It had become my calendar, my email, my camera, my todo list, my music player, and a hundred other things. It did each task well, and I even put up with it's growing mental malaise until it's 1 year cover was nearly up (it was seeing imaginary devices nearby in the same manner that John Forbes Nash Jr might have seen his life long friends).

The only question now is what I will be handed when I walk back into the phone store later - a shiny replacement iPhone, a reconditioned handset, or the old phone back with the same problem it had before?

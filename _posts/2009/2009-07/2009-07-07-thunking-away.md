You're probably wondering what on earth "Thunking" means. As far as I am aware, it comes from computer science - and is often used to describe the process of laboriously going through something, doing something mundane. It describes my life pretty well at the moment.

I can't remember a time when I shared less in my personal blog, or had as little motivation to write anything as has occurred recently. I've not even taken sideways glances at this neglected soap-box. It just hasn't entered my head to sit down and write anything.

In years gone by, my posts were either uncomfortably personal, filled with "foaming invective" (excellent description offered by a great colleague), or so mindlessly boring that they induced narcolepsy in the unwary. At least I was writing regularly though.

I'm also aware that I have not been reading friends blogs - or at least when I have, I have not been commenting. This is unheard of. Quite often I will take a glance at Google Reader, and convince myself that my opinion on this or that is inconsequential - and what's the point in saying something for the sake of it? Why would you say anything if you have nothing constructive to say?

Is it all about being constructive though? Am I becoming one dimensional - I get up - I work - I come home - I work some more - I go to bed...

I am reminded of a line from Mr Holland's Opus (that was probably stolen from somewhere else)...

You can cut the arts, but the kids will have nothing anymore to read and write about.

Swap "the arts" with "free time", and you edge a little closer to the world I inhabit at the moment. Take away the "me" time, and I have no recent experiences or thoughts to share with the world. I cannot talk about work, and I choose not to share too much about the children... which only leaves me, and there's not a lot of me left to report on at the moment.

Of course the easy answer is "you need to find more personal time". Yeah, right. Like that's going to happen...

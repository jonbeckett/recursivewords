Following an interesting idea invented by Antidamen on her LiveJournal, I'm turning this blog inside out today - and asking why you think you are so great;

What do you like about yourself?

Why do you think other people like you?

Answer in the comments, and I will respond in future posts with reciprocal reasons that I like those who commented. The world needs more happiness at the moment - and if that can be achieved through some literary fun, then all the better.

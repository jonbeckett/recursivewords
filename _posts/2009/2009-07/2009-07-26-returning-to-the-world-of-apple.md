This evening has been my first real chance to sit with the white Macbook - my Macbook - since it came back from being fixed by the local Applecare service center. I'm not going to get into the remaining problems with it; I'm just glad to have a nice computer back that is tailored towards the creation of content. For the last 18 months this computer more or less became the property of my other half - and when it started to come apart at the seams, I replaced it for her with a shiny new Macbook. This one sat in a bag for 6 months.

Why would a computer sit in a bag for six months? Because that's how long it takes anything outside the world of kids, family, or the house to happen around here. My iPhone went wrong in January. It finally found it's way to the shop to be serviced in early July. I have a car sat on the drive without a serviceable battery in it - the first chance I will realistically get to sort it out will be 5 weeks from now - UNLESS I take a day off work to make that happen.

I was looking at running shoes on the internet early this morning (inbetween washing up and tidying up), and eventually caught myself - what is the point in buying myself more running shoes when the only time I might get to go running would either involve getting up at 5am, or going out running at 9pm...

Life is ridiculous at the moment.

In the middle of all of this, I know damn well that I'm letting friendships slip, not reading far flung friend's blogs, and hardly ever visiting anybody any more.

When I first saw her on television, I thought "what on EARTH?!?", and switched channels. Since then the chorus lines of her songs have invaded my brain via the various background noises of our lives - and I find myself humming along now. Her music is like some kind of weird virus. A weapon.

Her entire persona is quite, quite mad. I like that.

This blog has been woefully neglected recently, and I can see no immediate opportunity to redress that. Work, life, and the universe in general are conspiring to eat all of my time. I'm belly-aching, aren't I.

In news somewhat related to blogging, I have my Macbook back from the Apple Service place nearby - they refused to fix the hairline cracks under the laptop, Apple Care didn't cover the battery failure, and they've put it together wrong (there is now about a 1mm gap between the palm rest and the body).

I'm wondering if to buy the tools and take the Macbook back to bits myself, and put it together carefully, and PROPERLY. It really annoys me that I PAID for Apple Care, and the engineer that "fixed" the machine couldn't be arsed to put it back together properly...

The iPhone is still with Apple, hopefully being replaced.

Letting me near technology at the moment is a bit dangerous - everything I have seems to go wrong.

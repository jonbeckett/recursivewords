While re-acquainting myself over the last few days with the various online communities I used to call home, I stumbled upon some excellent personal blogs that I had either forgotten about, or not seen before. In the spirit of sharing such discoveries, here they are;

Wonderland or Not

A wonderfully written collection of thoughts, observations, and experiences - well written, easy to read, and I love the design too.

Melindaville

An excellent memoir from somebody who lived the life many of us only ever read about in newspapers. Disarmingly honest, and wonderfully written.

Spill the Beans

Another wonderfully written "slice of life" blog.

The Las Vegas Courtesan Not Safe for Work!

Yes, this blog is exactly as the title describes, and it is most definitely not safe for work! I find it interesting because it describes a life that very few lead, warts and all. It's a reminder that those who work in the sex industry are real people, with the same hopes and fears as you and I.

Clary Lopez

Another thoughtful, personal blog that's well written, shares interesting thoughts, and poses thoughtful questions.

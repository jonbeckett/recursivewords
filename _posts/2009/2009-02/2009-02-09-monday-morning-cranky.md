My weekend consisted of getting up early, making breakfasts, getting the kids dressed, washing up, tidying up, working like a lunatic on freelance stuff, making lunches, washing up, tidying up, working on more freelance stuff, helping make dinner, washing up, tidying up, putting the kids to bed, more freelance work, and then crash into bed.

There were however two highlights this weekend.

The first was finding time late on Friday night to sit with W and watch several episodes of Big Bang Theory back-to-back. It meant we ended up going to bed at about 2am, but at least we had some time together for a change.

The other highlight was a trip out to the pub with my brother in law on Saturday night. I had no idea he was coming over until W told me in the morning - initially I thought "oh crap" because I had planned to get more work done in the evening, but after a pint at the pub and finally relaxing a bit, I really enjoyed the night out. We both had mixed grills which perhaps explains how I survived three bottles of Magners cider, a pint of Guinness, and half a bottle of wine.

Today finds me back in the office with little motivation, and a set of course notes to run through for an emerging technology. While sat at dinner on Friday night with W and the kids I said "nobody ever asks me what I did today". W said to the kids "ask Daddy what he did today"...

Kids - "What did you do today Dad?"

Me - "I learned all about the integration between K2 Black Pearl and Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007"

W - "and that's why we don't ask Daddy what he did today"

We'll be getting back in the car in a couple of hours time to travel home from my parents on the south west coast - a five hour car journey taking us through Cornwall, Devon, Somerset, Wiltshire, Berkshire, and finally Buckinghamshire.

Tomorrow morning we will all wake up to the real world once more. A world filled with work, expectations, commitments, costs, an endless task list, debts, and a severe lack of free time.

No doubt I'll wake up tomorrow ready to hit the ground running, but until then my head will be filled with all manner of thoughts.

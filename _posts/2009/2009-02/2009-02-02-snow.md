It was forecast, but I guess until you wake up, and it's coming down like a thick white blanket over the world around you, you don't always believe it.

Of course I am the only lunatic at work who cycled in - there are three of us in the office so far this morning...

... and the view from the office...

I might not stay here all day - it's a 3 mile bike ride home, and the snow is coming down heavier and heavier. I'll have to make a decision at some point probably.

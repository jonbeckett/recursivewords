I've been working away on a freelance project throughout most of Sunday. Where most people think web development is all about making websites look a certain way, today has been far from it. I've been replicating databases and websites to create a "staging" and "live" site - the idea being that people change the staging site, and the whole lot is pushed through now and again to "live".

Anyway.

It's nearly dinner time, so I should think about going and saying hello to the rest of the family (I've been holed up in the study since I got up this morning).

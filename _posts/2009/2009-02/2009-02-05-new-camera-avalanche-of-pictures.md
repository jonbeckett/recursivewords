I am retiring our huge, battery hungry Fuji S9500 with it's little successor - a Fuji Finepix S1000fd. It has all manner of cleverness wrapped up in it apparently, but most importantly it is smaller, and DAMN CHEAP.

Having a bit better camera than our point and click J10 will allow us to take the pictures we want to, rather than figure out what the camera is good at before taking them. Also, the S1000fd runs on standard AA batteries - which we have huge numbers of at home (for the Wii).

Expect an avalanche of pictures and photo blog posts from me when it arrives. As usual, this purchase was funded by me working all manner of ridiculous hours on freelance projects. It will also be the last fun thing I spend money on in a while - all further income is going towards a new(er) car.

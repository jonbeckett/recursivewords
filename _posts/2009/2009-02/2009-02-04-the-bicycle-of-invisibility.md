Before explaining about the two traffic incidents that occurred today - neither of which are out of the normal at all - it's worth explaining that when I ride my mountain bike to work, I wear a high visibility yellow cycling waterproof, and am huge - I stand about 6ft 4inches tall.

Thumping towards you on a mountain bike in a helmet, waterproofs, and walking boots, I am probably pretty intimidating. Unless you are a car driver that is.

Riding a bike in suburbia renders you invisible to car drivers. Particularly to those who are either late for work, or on their way home from the school run.

Incident No. 1

Time : 8:40am

Road : Henley Road

Description : gargantuan 4 wheel drive driven by middle aged yummy mummy sees a gap in traffic approaching the T-Junction she is waiting at, looks opposite way (straight at me - we made eye contact), and pulls out. I am forced to lock up the rear wheel and slide off the road.

Incident No. 2

Time : 5:50pm

Road : Newtown Road

Description : Massive "Animal" branded 4 wheel drive driven by wannabe younger affluent guy drives on the wrong side of the road past parked cars straight at me. He accelerates, and I make for the path. His side mirror hits my arm.

Today made me wonder for the first time in years - how long is it going to be until I am put in hospital by somebody driving on the wrong side of the road with no regard for anybody else?

A couple of years ago I saw a BMW X5 accelerate towards a young family along the path (sidewalk for those of you in the US) - forcing them to run into the garden of a house. The BMW was being driven by a twenty something career girl with perfect makeup and hair. The Mum and kids were in shock.

One evening on the way home from work I had a sports car accelerate past me (I was doing about 25mph), and turned immediately across the front of me. My rear wheel lifted into the air under braking, and an onlooker who saw the entire thing congratulated me on staying on the bike at all.

Most of the near misses I experience are forgotten within seconds of them happening because they are so damn common.

Cycling is bloody dangerous - especially during the morning or evening commute, when it appears far too many people are completely consumed with their own little world, and don't give a damn about anybody else.

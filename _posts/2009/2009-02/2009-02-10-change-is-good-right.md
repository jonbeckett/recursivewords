I know, I know... I changed the look of this blog again (if you're reading this through an RSS reader, you'll need to click on the title to see the wonderous boringness of the WordPress stock theme I have chosen).

I got bored. I was going to wait until WordPress released some more free themes, and while things looked hopeful earlier in the year (they released one), there has been nothing since. I'm resisting the temptation to compain too vociferously because I don't exactly pay anything to have this blog sat here on the internet.

In other news, I already ate my lunch, and it's only 11:40am. Also, if you were wondering - I'm having a coffee break from my work - hence the short/shallow/inconsequential nature of this post.

I considered buying a domain name yesterday to slap my own installation of WordPress on, but resisted it at the 11th hour (actually it was more like 1am). I even found myself looking at Squarespace - where Lauren hosts her blog. Reality finally kicked in, and the same thoughts I wrote about earlier resurfaced - do I really have a single valid reason to pay for this blog to exist?

Once upon a time I would have just paid the money and spent all day playing with plugins, html, javascript, custom themes, and so on - I'm not quite sure when I changed - when I became the polar opposite - "do I really need this? is there a free option?"...

Perhaps it coincides with the arrival of children in our lives - a tightening of the purse strings. Perhaps the number of commitments laden upon me force a certain pragmatism in decisions of what I am willing to invest time, effort and money into.

Who knows. Coffee break over.

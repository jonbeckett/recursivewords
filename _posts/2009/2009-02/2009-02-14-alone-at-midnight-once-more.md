Once again I'm sat here in the early minutes of the morning, alone downstairs, bathed in the light of the monitor, fingers tapping away at inconceivably complicated garbage in the pursuit of a second string career.

Only I'm not at the moment of course - I'm writing a useless blog post.

The freelance gig feels a little like a snowball rolling down a mountain side at the moment - it started (several months ago) feeling quite small, and manageable, but has rapidly grown. Without doing any proactive advertising, my reputation seems to be preceding me - with random emails from companies far and wide enquiring about hiring my services for various projects.

I'm having to learn to do something rather difficult - say no. I'm also having to learn how to say "I can do it, but I can't start it until next month". Amazingly, clients seem to accept that.

Back home on the ranch, I have a week off work from my day job, which could be seen as either a good or a bad thing. It's tempting to really hit the freelance trail and make some serious money - more than pay off the new car and begin throwing money down our hole in the ground (the mortgage). I'm also mindful that I should spend the daytime with the kids though, which is probably what I'll do.

Later in the week we are travelling down to Cornwall to visit my parents for a few days. We've not seen them since last summer - truth be told, I'm looking forward to seeing them, getting away, and having a rest. Even if it's sub zero, or tipping it down with rain - the prospect of sitting in front of a fire, playing silly games with the children will be wonderful.

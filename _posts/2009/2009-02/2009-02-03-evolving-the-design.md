This evening has been spent evolving the design of a website for a freelance client - trying out new design ideas and directions. Design is difficult, but ultimately the most rewarding part of the process, because not everybody can do it. HTML and CSS can both be taught, but coming up with something functional, aesthetic, and ergonomic cannot necessarily be taught.

As much fun as it is, I have to force myself to take breaks - a tired mind is not creative.

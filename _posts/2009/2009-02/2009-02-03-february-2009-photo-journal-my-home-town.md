I have been repeatedly requested by far flung friends for pictures of where we live - and today while walking through the snow and ice into town for emergency shopping, I finally took the camera with me.

All photos can be clicked on to see bigger versions in Flickr.

Just around the corner from our house...

We have about a mile walk into town - today the quieter roads were covered in snow and ice...

After getting the shopping, I got the camera out - the High Street...

The end of town, and the Church - the park is just out of shot to the right...

St Marys Church...

Marlow Bridge (prototype of the bridge over the Danube in Budapest) ...

The river Thames as it sweeps past the edge of town...

Birds huddled on a railing to keep warm...

Ducks braving the icy water...

Swans fighting over breadcrumbs...

Higginson Park...

One of the huge old trees in the park - well over 100ft tall, and about 10ft across...

Returning home and gathering up children from the green outside our house...

Getting caught up in a snowball fight before heading indoors for a nice warm cup of tea...

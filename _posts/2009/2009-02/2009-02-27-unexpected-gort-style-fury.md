The other day somebody posted a comment on a photo of one of our kids that nearly caused me to go nuclear on the spot.

It's worth pointing out that this "somebody" was somebody I knew, who knows me well, and I know their line in sarcasm - and their comment was probably a perfectly reasonable thing to ask about the photo in question.

It made me realise that the GORT style "MUST PROTECT AT ALL COSTS" thing that I've noticed lots of other parents have (usually the ones I aspire to be like) has somehow got switched on inside me. It's kind of nice to know that the paternal instinct has appeared, even though they are not our birth children - but also scary as hell. When will I next switch into berserk maniac killer robot mode? I hope it's not too near a room full of even tempered super parents.

Luckily this time I deactivated before doing anything I would later regret.

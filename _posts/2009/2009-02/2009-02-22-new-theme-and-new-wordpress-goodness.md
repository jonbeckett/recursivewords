When I moved my personal blog back to a hosted solution at wordpress.com it was for entirely fiscal reasons - we're busy cutting back on unwarranted expenditure at home, and web hosting accounts - although inexpensive - are a total luxury. Knowing that WordPress will host your blog for nothing made it a no-brainer.

The only drawback was the lack of themes available - except of course that new themes are now coming on-stream - such as the one I just switched over to called "Vigilance". It has all manner of customizable attributes - none of which I have monkeyed with yet - and uses a serif font, which I have to admit to liking rather a lot.

WordPress now has threaded comments too - a long awaited feature that could mean the end of systems such as Disqus. It's a small feature, but one that allows me to reply to comments in context. This is a good thing, and turns comments into the start of a conversation rather than random graffiti.

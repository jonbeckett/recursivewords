I called home earlier today, knowing that W went looking at replacement cars.

Apparently we are now the proud owners of a Citroen Picasso. We also of course own a Renault Scenic - although we'll be calling various places tomorrow to see if anybody wants to buy it off us, having just spent over a thousand getting it fixed (a mysterious light on the dashboard was a harbinger of fiscal doom).

The Picasso is somewhere between faded red and bubblegum pink. The girls think it's the best thing in the known universe, but then I don't really care - I doubt I'll be getting in it more than once every couple of weeks anyway.

My main mode of transport - come rain or shine - is a mountain bike. Over the last two days - in torrential rain - I have been soaked through to my underwear three times. It's not particularly funny the first time - let alone the third time. This evening I took delivery of a new set of waterproofs that should hopefully turn the battle with the great deluge back in my favor.

In an effort to pay for the sudden requirement for a new car, (and start chipping away at our debt mountain, I have been working a crazy amount of hours recently - both professionally, and freelance. This evening I carried on the moment I walked in the door, and didn't stop until nearly 11pm. It was the same yesterday evening.

Now I'm eating more minutes of the remainder of my evening pumping words into this blog. Being annoyed with an imaginary listener. It works somehow - in a moment I will hit submit, and walk away from the study in a somewhat lighter mood. Annoyed is the wrong term really - just weary. I may well call a halt to the madness tomorrow and have a night off. Watch movies - eat chocolate - that kind of thing.

Time to hit submit methinks.

If you look up mediocrity in the dictionary, you find the following;

 1. the state or quality of being mediocre.            2. mediocre ability or accomplishment.            3. a mediocre person.          

... which doesn't really tell us a lot. If you look up mediocre in the dictionary, you find this instead;

 1. of only ordinary or moderate quality; neither good nor bad; barely adequate.            2. rather poor or inferior.          

It seems mediocre is a fairly good evaluation of this blog. I put almost no effort into the writing it contains, or advertising it's existence. It's main purpose for existence is to inform friends and family what I'm up to, and what's on my mind. Half the time I suspect nobody cares what might be on my mind, and the rest of the time I should probably display better judgement in the topics I choose to write about.

With notable exceptions (Dooce, Petite Anglaise, etc), personal blogs do not flourish. Perhaps interestingly, it's those of us who write blogs who tend to read blogs too - forging a small community for ourselves of people we have never met, but perhaps know better than their friends and family.

Here's to mediocrity, and our circles of strangers we share each day with. Long may it continue.

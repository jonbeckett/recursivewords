Finally some sense came to the Wimbledon tennis tournament today, when a quietly spoken Argentinian girl beat Maria Sharapova. While Sharapova grunted, screamed, bellowed, and yelled her way around the court, Dulko quietly got on with the job.

You can't help thinking it would be nice to see another Steffi or McEnroe out there though...

I have had this domain name sat dormant for quite a while - www.blogfriday.net - and have been wondering what to do with it.

BlogFriday was originally setup as a meme engine - where a single word was posted each week, and visitors linked their posts themed by the seed word. It worked well enough, but never really took off - and when the spammers got hold of it, I decided to pull the plug.

I'm thinking that BlogFriday could be a visitor generated list of blogs they like, and perhaps run a weekly chart of the most popular blog each week (with some kind of voting). It would make sense to integrate it with twitter too - allowing the site to collate any posts with the hashtag "blogfriday", and index their links...

Any thoughts ?

I've been having a bit of a sort out this morning (in between making breakfast for everybody, coffee, getting dressed, brushing teeth, dealing with tantrums... the normal stuff...). I've been trying to figure out how best to follow my far flung friends on the internet such that they don't think I've forgotten them.

I am rubbish. There, I said it. I get consumed with whatever I am doing, and the rest of the world may well not exist for weeks on end - and then I flip flop back towards wanting to know how the rest of the world is, and become a temporary social maven.

So. I was looking at easy ways I might drag the happenings and thoughts my friends record around the internet towards myself such that I could easily dip my toe in their firehose from time to time. It looks like FriendFeed may still be the best answer, but it's not perfect. Using it properly will involve adding people as "imaginary friends" that do not have FriendFeed accounts - and it's yet another social network to keep track of (but in this case a utilitarian one, rather than a destination). My main concern would be that I forget about people.

Perhaps the RSS reader is STILL the best option. Who knows.

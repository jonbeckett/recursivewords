I ate burgers for dinner every night last week while staying in the hotel, and then on friday capped the week off with a pizza. Not exactly good for me.

With that in mind, I'm trying to eat a little more healthily this week.

Holy crap I'm tired though... apparently we're heading out in half an hour, but I'm struggling to keep my eyes open.

Do you ever lose track of which day of the week it is? I have this evening. While staying away from home, I have begun counting the days by the number of sets of underwear I have left.

I know I left the house with a set for each day, and I can look in the case to see how many I have already worn - therefore I can figure it out. It's shocking, isn't it - to think I have been reduced to devoting thought to such mundane idiocy. I'm starting to understand how Tom Hanks character in "Castaway" felt.

While walking through the hotel this evening wearing jeans and a hooded sweater, I couldn't help people watching - comparing the various clothes people wear in hotels.

Lots of people seemed to be in very smart business dress - obviously relaxing after some conference or other. The ones who interested me were those wearing "smart casual" clothes. I'm probably making some grossly inaccurate, sweeping generalisation here, but I think all managers wear short sleeved shirts and trousers all the time. I think they're born wearing them. They always seem to fall into stereotype where you expect them to have a pocket protector on their shirt, or at least aspire to owning a pocket protector.

While walking past the hotel bar, I couldn't help noticing the skew towards men versus women. I remember talking to a female colleague years ago who hated staying in hotels on her own because she would invariably be chatted up repeatedly if she tried to eat or have a drink in the hotel bar.

Of course, if I didn't wander the hotel in scruffy jeans, and a casual GAP top, I might get chatted up too - I expect I don't fit the "first impression" of "he looks like he has money" that the shirt and tie'd version of myself conveys...

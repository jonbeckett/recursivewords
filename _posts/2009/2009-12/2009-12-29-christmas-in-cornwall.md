In the same manner as Tolkein's Hobbits having "second breakfast", we are having a second Christmas of sorts at my parents in Cornwall. It's the first opportunity W and I have had to really switch offfor monthsand a great opportunity for my parents to spend some quality time with their grandchildren.

Tomorrow I have arm twisted my Dad into coming to watch Avatar with us in Plymouthit's probably the first time he's been to the cinema in 10 years.

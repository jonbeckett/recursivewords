I'm finally home this evening after four days away with work. After ringing the doorbell, I heard excited shouts from two little girls who had been allowed to stay up late to see me. Our youngest ran back into the house on-sight shouting "Daddys home!", except of course there was nobody to hear her. Perhaps she was telling the house.

The next ten minutes were spent press ganged on the couch with little miss 4, and little miss 5 standing in front of me, showing me toys from their advent calendars, what they made at school, and telling me at top speed all the things I had missed out on.

A little later in the evening our eldest arrived home from Brownies. She didn't notice me at first, and then while passing the living room doorway finally spotted me and ran in for a huge hug. Apparently she's been very quiet since I have been working away from home; given their background it's not surprising - they don't like change.

At bedtime she hugged me a little harder than normal, and whispered "I missed you Dad".

Back downstairs W trudged into the kitchen, quietly walked towards me, and wrapped her arms around me. I think she missed me too.

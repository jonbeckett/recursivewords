This evening myself and several colleagues headed out to watch the new James Cameron movie "Avatar" at the local cinema. Stunning. No other words for it. Absolutely stunning. It was a privilage to witness a movie that will be talked about in years to come.

In recent days I have begun to hear rumblings from movie critics that Avatar wasn't all they had hoped, and that was backed up by the views of my colleagues this evening. After thinking about it for a while, I would perhaps turn the argument on it's headmany movie goers will not "get" Avatar. If you care about the world, about the way we (as humans) mistreat the world around us and each other, and have any kind of rebellious or anarchic streak in you, you will enjoy Avatar too. If you have an open mind, and even a little escapism in your heart, you will be enthralled by it. Wonderful, wonderful movie.

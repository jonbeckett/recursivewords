It's Christmas Eve, and I am finally home for more than a couple of days after several months spent in a hotel with work. I had anticipated being at work today, but a list went around the company email system yesterday detailing who was going to be in and on-call. My absence from the list was a pleasant surprise. In all honesty if I had been required to work today it would have meant a disaster at home; W has been housebound with the children for the last four days due to snow and icemy return has engineered her escape to buy groceries, and have a couple of hours to herself before the real mayhem starts.

I wish I could report that I'm full of Christmas spirit, but I am notat least not yet. I've had absolutely nothing to do with festive activities so far this yearmy life has been consumed with work, work and more work. I've done no wrapping, no putting up of decorations, and have been Christmas shopping for a grand total of 20 minutes. W and the children have done everything.

Throughout it all a nagging voice in my head has been repeating "you only have a few special years while the children are small, and you're missing it!" It would be easy to become angry with my employer, but another voice tells me that I am lucky to have a job that keeps a roof over our head, and which rewards me for the work I do. I am much more lucky than many.

This morning feels very much like bringing my life backon-line. I'm unpacking bags with no intention of re-packing them; or at least not any time soon. The months spent in the Birmingham Hilton Metropole taught me many, many lessons about living from a bagwith no ties, and no place to call home. While navel gazing one evening a friendon-linepointed me towards the upcoming movie "Up in the Air"it will be interesting to watch given my recent experiences. For the past months the iPhone, netbook, and a 3G data card have been my best friendsthey have afforded a continuing connection to the internet and my wider circle of friends. Given the demands of working most days and often continuing late into the night (of my own choice, to both complete my work on time, and at a quality I was happy with), all of my relationships sufferedboth at home and further afield. The Christmas break is affording me the chance to correct that somewhat. Random change of subject"Goodbye" by Miley Cyrus just began playing on iTunes. Wonderful, wonderful song. If I don't get a chance to write again before tomorrow, best wishes for you and your family this Christmas. I will no doubt be online at various times over the coming days, so shout if you see me online!

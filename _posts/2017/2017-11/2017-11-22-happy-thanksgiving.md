Just a quick post to wish all I know around the world that are celebrating thanksgiving all the best. We don't celebrate it on this side of the world, but I know lots of people that do - many of which will be gathering together with family and friends to eat themselves to a standstill, do their best to avoid arguments, and fight over what forgettable movie to put on the TV.

Happy Thanksgiving!

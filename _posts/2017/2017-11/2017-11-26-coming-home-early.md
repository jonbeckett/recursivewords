I came home from work early today. It turns out spending the whole of Saturday with somebody fighting a terrible cold pretty successfully transfers the germs to you. Who knew? I was fine until lunchtime, then throughout the afternoon it has felt like somebody pulled my power cable out.

Somehow I think tomorrow might be all about pyjamas, cups of tea, and a book or two. Actually, we all know that's a load of rubbish - I'll end up trudging my way across the internet, reading and following blogs, writing comments, and procrastinating famously.

Of course there's also the chance that I'll wake up tomorrow, and talk myself into going to the office. I can't remember the last time I was off sick - it's probably a couple of years ago - the company hates us going in with colds or flu though, because it spreads around the offices and brings everybody down.

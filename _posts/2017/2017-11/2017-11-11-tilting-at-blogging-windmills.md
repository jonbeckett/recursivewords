I bought a magazine yesterday morning - a magazine all about blogging. Within it's pages there are interviews with "bloggers of note", lots of explanatory articles about what to write about, how to write it, when to write it, where to write it, and all sorts of other rubbish. And that's just it - it'srubbish.

Instead of doing what I had intended, and spending an hour visiting some of the blogs covered in the magazine interviews, I fell down a colossal internet rabbit hole (something I'm particularly skilled at, I should perhaps mention), and went on my own journey of discovery. For four or five hours. I'm not really sure how long I spent reading, liking, following, and commenting - but one blog lead to another, and another.

It was re-affirming in all sorts of ways. For the longest time I have wondered if blogging was dead. Maybe not dead, but certainly on life support. It's probably worth qualifying what I mean by "blogging" - I mean people sharing the days of their lives - posting candid adventures, thoughts, hopes and dreams for others to trip over as they wander past. Anything else isn't really "blogging" in my mind - it's certainly something, but not "blogging".

Anywaytoday turned out alright for a change.

Here's to us, and our stories, experiences, hopes, dreams, disasters, and whatever else we choose to share (you know, instead of packaging, marketing, and selling it).

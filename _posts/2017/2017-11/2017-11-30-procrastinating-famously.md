To be perfectly honest, I'm not getting an awful lot done today. It comes to something when the only accomplishment you can really think of for the morning has been re-installing KIK on your mobile phone. I'm "strangecodex", if you have it installed on your phone.

I used to have a KIK account, but deleted it in one of the insane purges I occasionally go through - deleting apps, accounts, and identities here, there, and everywhere around the internet.

Anyway. That was all. Please excuse me while I try to find old friend's KIK usernames, and re-connect with them. I'm not even sure many people use it any more - if you do, say hello!

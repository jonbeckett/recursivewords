Tonight I finally got around to watching"The Perks of Being a Wallflower" - ahead of reading the book, which has been sitting on the shelf in the junk room for what must be four years now.

Now I get it. Now I understand the reverence the book and movie are given by those that have connected with them.

While there is a huge disconnect - decades, wealth, and culture - between myself and the characters in the story, I still found myself drawing parallels.

I was also blind-sided by the revelations towards the end.

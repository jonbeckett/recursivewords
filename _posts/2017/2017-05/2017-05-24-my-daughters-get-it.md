I have three girls - aged 16, 13, and 12. Tonight they made me perhaps the most proud I have been of them in quite some time. We were talking about the bombing in Manchester - and if there was anything we could do. I suggested that we might buy some of Ariana Grande's albums.

Miss 13 suddenly turned into a politician.

"Yeah - because if we buy it, that's saying you can't stop us from doing anything - we're going to do what we're going to do - we're going to listen to what we want, and do what we want".

Miss 12 joined in.

"Nobody can stop us doing what we want. Isn't it Dad."

Miss 16 looked up from her computer as I poked my head into her room.

"Do you listen to Ariana Grande's music?"

She looked at me like I just stepped off a shuttle bus from Mars.

"Duh.. YES!?"

"What do you think about us buying some of her music to make a statement about what happened in Manchester?"

"Do you really need to ask me that?!"

She grinned like an idiot.

I swear we didn't bring them up to become demonstrators, or activists, but they totally would if given a cause even vaguely relating to them.

For the last few months I have kept two blogs going - one at Tumblr, which is easy and fast, and one at WordPress, that looks nicer, but is more time consuming to post to. I also copy every single post into a vast collection of text files in markdown format, lest the internet should ever do anything disasterous to the garbage I've written.

I'm wondering about canning WordPress and just using Tumblr, and keeping copies of the written posts in markdown format as I always have. I may remove them from GitHub though, because that seems a bit like overkill. Maybe Dropbox. I'm not sure yet.

I admire so many of the blogging community so much through the photos and thoughts they share. They are all by turns brave, honest, fierce, beautiful, interesting, wise, funny, and beguiling in their own way. They share both happy and sad times with the great unwashed masses of the internet, and I think the world of them for doing so.

I suppose in many ways I am living vicariously through each of their lives, and mine becomes the richer for them. All I can say is thankyou to them - thankyou for being out there, and thankyou for affording me the opportunity to share a little in each of their lives.

They all rule.

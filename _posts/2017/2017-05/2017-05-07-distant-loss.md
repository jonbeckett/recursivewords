Somebody I vaguely knew via the internet died today. She was not the first, and will not be the last, but it was another reminder that our time on this planet is short, and can end without warning.

She was killed in a road traffic accident. It's on the BBC News website at the time of writing - she was riding on the back of a scooter, which was hit by an 18 wheel truck in Thailand. I just looked at her YouTube channel - the thing she was famous for - and there is no mention yet that she has passed away. Looking at the comments, nobody has mentioned it yet either. Nobody knows.

It's an odd feeling - knowing you know, and knowing very few others do. It's not my place to break the news, so I won't leave a comment yet. I may in days to come.

Hug those close to you. You just never know...

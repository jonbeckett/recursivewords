I woke a little after 7am this morning, and stared at the ceiling for a while, listening to the clock radio. I have no idea how to re-program it not to kick in on weekend mornings - we lost the instruction book quite some time ago. You probably have to do something simple like hold three buttons down simultaneously for five seconds, and then cycle through twenty five different options on the display that only shows the time. Kind of similar to the Apollo guidance computer really. How could you forget something like that ?

After jumping in the shower, clearing the kitchen, and consuming half my body weight in coffee, I set off into town on a mission to buy flea powder. We have three cats, and the weather is slowly warming up - so guess what's happening. I sat in the junk room for five minutes last night, and felt something jump on my foot. Twice.

Needless to say the entire room has now been fumigated with evil smelling sprays, carpet powders, and hoovered to within an inch of it's life. The little bastards are going to lose spectacularly. Mark my words.

In other news, I wiped two of the computers in the house this week - my old desktop computer (that I have re-inherited), and my old netbook (which I have also re-inherited). They now have shiny new installations of Windows 7 on them (don't laugh). I know - I'm rocking it like it's 2012 again, but they FLY on the old operating system, and apart from a new suit of clothes, it's functionally identical to Windows 10.

I'm not running a virus killer on either of them, because I've only seen one virus on any computer in our house in the last ten years - and that was down to the kids being stupid. Antivirus software is always too late to catch anything worth catching (witness the WannaCry epidemic recently).

I was going to try and cut some of the grass outside this afternoon, but the sky is rapidly clouding up like a Hollywood Alien invasion is about to happen. Seriously. Spectacular storm clouds. If it does rain like the world's ending I might end up laughing quite a lot - because the elitist idiots in town have organised a "party in the park" that costs 40 per head to enter. If it gets washed out it will serve them right. Even though we couldn't afford to go anyway, I'm not bitter about any of it - I'm just opposed to people creating events that bar people from attending based on wealth. It's ridiculous.

Finally - maybe the break in "almost every day blogging" has done me some good. If I take away the pressure of posting something every day, I actually find myself with things to say now and again. Who knew!?

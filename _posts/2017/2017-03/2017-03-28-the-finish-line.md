This afternoon I finally dragged the project I have been working on over the finish line.Of course this is only the first finish line. The monstrosity I have been working on will be unleashed on the "End Users" in days to come, who I have no doubt will put it to the sword in the various creative ways that nobody would ever have imagined. I'm trying not to think too much about it.

I suddenly have my evenings back. I'm almost giddy with anticipation of the things I might fill them with. Tonight I moved the X-Box 360 to Miss 16's bedroom, put two loads of washing through the machine, and began clearing the desks in the junk room for my other half to use for dress making. Such an exciting life (not).

To be honest, I'm just looking forward to having some time to myself. Time to read the odd book, time to watch an occasional movie, and of course time to write blog posts. You never know - I might write something worth reading one of these days.

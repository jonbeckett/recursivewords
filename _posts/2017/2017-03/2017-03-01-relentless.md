I feel like I'm on some kind of treadmill at the moment. Almost every day is the same. The same routine from the moment I get up, until the moment I fall asleep.

I'm always watching the clock - it's just gone 7pm, which means I have about 45 minutes to write this and post it before heading out to pick a not-so-little person up and return her home. The blog post will take far less time than that of course, because I gave up any pretence of investing effort in the words I write some time ago.

I misjudged how long it might take to write this. An hour has now passed, and I've been out to fetch Miss 13 from football practice. Now I'm wondering what to do with myself. There is a strong temptation to download the source-code of the project I have been doing at work, and carry on with it for a few hours - to see how far I can get. I really am my own worst enemy.

While on the subject of personal idiocy, I started posting to Tumblr again this morning. I logged in before work, and cross-posted links to all of the posts here to-date. I can't see myself using it for anything more than that, but you never know. It will be interesting to see how many people discover it from the circle I used to follow. I'm going to be none of them do. Let's hope the universe surprises me.

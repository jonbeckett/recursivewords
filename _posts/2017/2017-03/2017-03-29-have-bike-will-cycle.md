Not a lot of people know that I cycle to work every day. I don't actually own or drive a car. It means we save a small fortune every year, and it also means I don't end up with a backside the size of a small planet.

I see all kinds of idiocy while weaving my way through town each morning and evening - most of it brought about by trophy mothers heading off for coffee mornings after dropping their children at school in ridiculous chrome emblazoned monster trucks.

Sometimes I swear under my breath. Sometimes I swear out-loud.

I ride a single speed"Charge Plug 0 by the way. It's about as minimalist as you can sensibly get. No gears, no mudguards, and no idiotic cycling computer. Just me, my legs, the bike, and occasional swearing.

I'm sitting, gazing absently at the computer screen, and can't think what on earth to write. I've been buried in a vast software development project at work for the last few weeks, and it's eaten most of my thoughts during waking hours. I've had the source code on my mind while cycling to and from work, while shopping for groceries - even while standing in the shower on a morning.

I'm tempted to load the source code up at home this evening, but know that's the start of a slippery slope.

I quietly re-joined Tumblr [https://telespoke.tumblr.com/] a few days ago. I've been posting links to the forgettable detritus I post here, but can feel gravity well pulling me slowly back in. It's probably a mistake, and yes, I know I'm over-thinking it.

There's something about Tumblr - there always has been, and I can't quite put my finger on it. It's almost like it's attractive in spite of itself. The people that inhabit it's whirling, churning mess of content tend to burn a little more brightly than those you find elsewhere. Of course many of them are mindless narcissists, and some are sociopaths, but you find that everwhere.

I guess you could say I'm dangling a toe back into the tumbling waters before a shark grabs my leg and pulls me under.

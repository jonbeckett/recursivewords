"What light through yonder window breaks? It is the Javascript Client Object Model, and I am the Sun, burning everything to ashes around me while celebrating getting this damn thing working". Now you can see why I'm not a famous playwright. It would have been pretty funny if Shakespeare had written "BURN THIS MOTHER DOWN!" at some point in one of his plays.

When I arrived at work this morning I knew what I had to do, and I had no idea how I was going to do it. After spending the first three quarters of an hour correcting my own spelling mistakes in three lines of programming (it turns out computers are unreasonably picky about spelling mistakes), I turned to a co-worker and said "do you ever get to the point in the day when you think it might be better to just go home, and try again tomorrow?"

By late morning my brain and fingers seemed to be working in concert with one another, and I lucked into Googling the answer to a part of the thing I had no clue how to do. Ten minutes after that the thing I've been working on for the last however long burst into life.

This is all tremendously vague, isn't it. The thing is - if I start telling anybody exactly what I'm working on, I'll no doubt get that call from HR to pop down for a "quick chat". It's happened before. I've worked hard to cloak this blog with a certain level of anonymity, and I'm not going to blow a huge hole in it myself - other people are far more capable of doing that by writing my name in comments, tweets, and posts elsewhere.

On another note, it's good to be back at Squarespace. As much as I tried to convince myself that WordPress and Blogger had all sorts of benefits, they really didn't. In many ways I was being the destructive little kid sitting in the corner, taking each pencil out of his pencil case, snapping it into pieces, and throwing it in the bin while muttering quiet threats in the direction of whoever might be listening.

I'll shut up now.

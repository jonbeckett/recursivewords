We were invited to a friends this evening to eat, drink, and spend a few hours catching up with one another. We sat in the garden, ate wonderful food, drank fantastic drinks, and talked about all manner of rubbish that we probably won't remember in the morning.

The evening was kind of perfect.

I need to sleep now. I have another day ahead of me in the garden, doing battle with the jungle that threatens to envelop our house. If I come across a chap called "Livingston", I'll call the British Museum.

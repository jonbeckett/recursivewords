About a year ago I reduced the number of people I call a friend on Facebook down to just those I know in the "real world" - old school friends, the parents of my childrens friends, co-workers, and so on. It wasn't a complete cull, but it was pretty significant.

At the time I convinced myself that it was "the right thing to do" - because I was cross-posting photos into Instagram, Tumblr, Flickr, and Facebook, and it all ended up seeming a bit mad - I was seeing the same content from everybody in multiple places in much the same way I expect they were seeing my stuff. I don't like seeing the same content everywhere, so stopped doing it - and started cutting ties. I also didn't want to have the conversation with "real world" friends about who all these people were that were liking things I posted.

After reading a few posts by those I have come to know through LiveJournal, WordPress, Twitter, Tumblr, Blogger, Instagram, or wherever else - I'm wondering about saying "to hell with it", and crossing the streams again.

A part of me thinks "if I send a friend request again, they're going to be pretty annoyed with me for keep changing my mind". Another part of me thinks it will be pretty entertaining for the more nosey of my "real world" friends to see the sudden influx of likes and comments from people all over the world.

If you see a friend request on Facebook from me, you'll know why. Of course I don't know half of your real names, so that's going to be fun too.

Click here -http://bit.ly/2rnUFaM- and request me as a friend if you haven't received anything from me (because I'm terrible at most things on the internet - I would make a rubbish stalker).

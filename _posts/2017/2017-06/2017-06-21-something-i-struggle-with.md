When any of you post a nice photo, or tell a funny story, I'm invariably late to the game. I think "I have to write a comment on that" - "awesome photo", "beautiful", "gorgeous", "huge hugs", or something along those lines. And then I see the usual suspects have already plastered comments all over it, and I walk away.

It kind of reminds me of being at school again - of not being one of the "cool kids", and being fairly quiet by nature - being drowned out by the loud, obnoxious crowd. I was always the kid in the background, watching everything happen, and rarely being included. It probably explains why I spend all my time these days trying to include others, and giving very little of myself.

Anyway. If you receive a private message from me rather than a comment, now you know why.

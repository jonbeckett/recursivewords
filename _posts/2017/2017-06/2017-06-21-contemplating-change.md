For the last week or so I've got in from work, done the chores, then sat outside and watched the cats, hedgehogs, bats, and whatever else go about their business until bedtime. I have hardly touched the computer. The blog posts I have written have been very much "turn the handle on the sausage machine" posts about nothing in particular.

I'm sure I will return to the endless streams of navel gazing I've written for the past however many years, but in the meantime I can't help feeling I need to change it up somehow.

Maybe the best idea will be to leave everything alone, and enjoy the quiet evenings for a little while longer.

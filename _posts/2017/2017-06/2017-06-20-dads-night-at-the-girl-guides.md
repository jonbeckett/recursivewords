After getting home from work this evening, eating dinner, and washing up, we headed straight back out to "Dad's Night" with the local Girl Guides. I guess this happened because it was "Father's Day" in the UK last weekend.

I won't get started on how ridiculous "Father's Day" is.

So what did the night consist of? Running around a field doing activities organised by the older kids in 30C+ temperatures while those same kids sat in the middle of the field on their phones. The games were badly organised, and there seemed to be no leader input involved.

I'm being unfair.

The kids organised the games themselves. Planning, and arranging the games was on them - and I imagine there will be a lot of learning involved next week, talking about what worked, and what they could have changed.

The one huge success of the evening was a mass game of Netball at the end of the night - except it was Netball with a twist. Instead of goals, you have two buckets full of water, and instead of a ball, you have a bar of soap. Netball with soap and water. It got ridiculously competitive - with a few of the parents forgetting that we were there to have fun. We're totally going to get the neighbourhood kids to play it on the green outside our house though.

It's now midnight, and I'm about to turn in for the night. My phone is flat, in case you were wondering why I haven't posted anything for the last couple of days. I'm wondering about formatting it, because it's been dying on it's ass quite a bit just recently - there's obviously some rubbish on it somewhere that's eating it's brain.

I think I'm going to have some aches and pains in the morning. Slipping over on soaking wet grass while covered in soap caused more than a few people to go flying - myself included.

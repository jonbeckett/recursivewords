Our youngest just received a phonecall from Santa en-route. He got our postcode wrong. We heard the shouted conversation on the upstairs landing, and the thundering of feet as she rushed to tell us.

The image of her bursting into the lounge to tell us that she had been right to keep her mobile phone with her all evening will stay with me forever.

She believes so strongly you begin to question yourself - even though you're a player in the story.

In other news, we just made my parents evening.

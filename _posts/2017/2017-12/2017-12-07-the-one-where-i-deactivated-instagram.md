I suppose this has been coming for quite some time. While waiting for a virtual server to spin up at work this morning, I logged into Instagram (where I had shared nearly four thousand little square photos), and deactivated the account.

I know, I know - this is me flying in the face of everybody else, as per usual. Almost everybody is using Instagram now - I get it. I'm just getting a bit fed up with little square photos, when I could be sharing big rectangular photos.

This is probably where you tell me I'm a colossal idiot, and shout something about reactivating the account immediately before you do something quite drastic to my bits and pieces.

I'm slowly uploading the universe to Flickr [https://flickr.com/photos/strangecodex]. If the world-wide server farm crashes in a smoking heap, I'll happily claim that one. I can imagine pulling the team behind Flickr from the wreckage, wide eyed, mumbling incoherently about the torrent of little square photos that signalled the apocalypse. Ok, maybe a little dramatic.

Oh, and huge thank you to Giorge Thomas [https://giorgethomas.com/] for saying all sorts of nice things about my forgettable photos of London, and featuring them in her recent posts.

Postscript - I reactivated, after switching names - I'm now StrangeCodex [https://instagram.com/strangecodex] at Instagram too, but don't plan on using it much.

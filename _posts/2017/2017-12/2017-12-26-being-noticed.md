I've never really felt like I "fitted in" anywhere. Throughout college I was not one of the popular crowd that hung out together, and through my twenty-something years I never had the circle of friends that went to bars and clubs.

Here's the thing. Somewhere along the way the people I would have been too nervous to talk to in those formative years have started following the words and pictures I post.

It feels like being noticed, in a quiet way. I spend much of my time online contributing, but mostly slipping under everybody's radar. Being noticed is kind of an alien experience - it's like I've been taken by the hand by some of the in-crowd, and dragged across the bar to meet their friends.

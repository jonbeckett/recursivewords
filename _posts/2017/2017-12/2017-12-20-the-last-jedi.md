I just got home from the cinema. I'm happy, sad, excited, weary, elated, and torn - all at the same time. So many emotions.

I grew up with the Star Wars movies - something about them taps into the eight year old me, leaving the cinema in the dark, holding my Dad's hand, wanting to run down the street making light-saber noises.

For a couple of hours every few years my life isn't about expectation, obligation, chores, parenting, responsibility, and all those other things - it's about a galaxy far, far away.

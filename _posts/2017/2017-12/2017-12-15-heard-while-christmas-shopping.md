In-between chores, and delivering children to birthday parties, we managed to get some Christmas shopping done today. While browsing the books in our local branch of Waterstones, I heard the following conversation:

"Have you seen the size of the queue?"

"There's lots of staff on the checkouts though"

"I'm just saying - if we ordered it from Amazon right now, it would arrive at home within six hours"

"Are you going to carry on like this all day?"

"I've been stood outside in the cold waiting for you for the last hour"

"It's been ten minutes!"

I had to walk away, fearing I might start giggling out-loud.

While browsing Twitter late last night I happened upon an acquaintance wondering how some people generate so many comments on their blogs, and scrolled through her recent "tweets". Nearly every thought that had passed through her head in the previous 48 hours had become a tweet - no wonder people were keeping the hell away from her. The scene formed in my head that we've all witnessed - where you visit a bar or a coffee shop, and somebody across the room likes the sound of their own voice a bit too much.

It made me think though - about this whole blogging lark - about how often I post.

I invariably post once a day, remarking about a forgettable moment, something that crossed my mind, or whatever else seemed worthy of a few words. Occasionally I post more than once - like today - mainly because I have nothing else to be getting on with. While I know many people post far more often than me, I'm wondering about slowing down even more.

You see, I don't have a tremendously exciting life. There are only so many days filled with the same chores everybody else has, or the work I can't write about, that can be recorded in any sort of interesting manner. Given this relative scarcity of exciting thoughts, ideas, or stories to tell, I'm considering an earth shattering idea - only posting when I have something worth posting about.

I know, I know. It's a pretty earth-shattering concept. It's going to be difficult - sitting on my hands when I might take a photo of a cup of coffee, or tell you about the train platform I happen to be standing on, but I think I can do it.

Oh, and in other news, I just ordered a Nokia 3310.

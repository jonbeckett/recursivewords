I ordered a new mobile phone this morning - it will arrive in the post tomorrow. It's the 2017 version of the cheapest handset Nokia make. Before you think "oh my word - he's finally lost the plot", it's probably worth clarifying that it's only intended as a backup phone, with a pay-as-you-go SIM in it.

I will admit there is a huge temptation to switch to it though - to divorce myself from the legion of mobile phone apps I've come to rely on. It might also have something to do with my old Instagram account being hacked overnight. I got the account back, and changed passwords everywhere, but in doing so it made me realise how big my footprint on the internet has become, and how ridiculous it all is.

Beyond a phone and text messaging, there's very little I really use my mobile phone for. Sure, I have KIK, Snapchat, WhatsApp, Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, Instagram, Flickr, and all the rest installed, but I very rarely use any of it. If my other half ever wants to get hold of me she either calls, or sends a text message.

Would you miss the apps on your phone if you didn't have them?

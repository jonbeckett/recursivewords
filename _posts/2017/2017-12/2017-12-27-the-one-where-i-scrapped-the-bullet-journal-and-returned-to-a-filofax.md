We all knew this was going to happen, didn't we.

During the autumn I got seduced by the idea of a Bullet Journal, and spent several months writing neat little tick lists. For the first week or so I even took care over the presentation of each page, and started charting ridiculous things like waking times, mealtimes, and so on in little charts spread throughout the pages. Yeah. I stopped doing that pretty quickly.

Fast forward three months, and the Bullet Journal had become a very expensive hand-written version of a Filofax. It occurred to me that the only difference between the two was the Bullet Journal forced me to write future events in a month or year log and then migrate them forwards, rather than write them in the correct place to start with.

I suppose a huge part of this is familiarity too. I've been using a Filofax for a very long time - and while I can see that Bullet Journals have some benefits, I'm also inherently lazy - so having a printed book with the dates already in it wins for me.

This is the part where everybody with a Bullet Journal calls me an idiot, everybody with a Filofax says "told you so", and everybody else says "why aren't you using Google Calendar?"

Remember that thought about returning to a simple mobile phone, instead of a smart-phone? That. I'm still thinking about it. While I have no doubt friends will laugh at my decision to walk away from the social idiocy, I'm also looking forward to making a start on all the books I've been meaning to read for the last several years, but put to one side while I just checked Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, WordPress, Flickr, and so on.

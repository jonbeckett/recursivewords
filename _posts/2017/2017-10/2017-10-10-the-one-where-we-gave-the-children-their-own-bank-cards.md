Two mysterious envelopes arrived in the post this afternoon, addressed to my younger daughters. After spotting the postal return addresses on them, I almost threw them away, but curiosity got the better of me and I opened them. The envelopes contained bank debit cards, with their names on them.

This had to be either an astoundingly expensive mail shot campaign, or my other half had been up to something. After a quick phone call I confirmed - my other halfhad been up to something.

Our children now have contactless chip-and-pin debit cards, topped up by the "Bank of Mum and Dad". Instead of getting pocket money from now on, they will receive money directly into their account once a month, and can see their balance in a mobile app.

Here's hoping it teaches them a little about looking after money - at this moment they think they are rich, having just received a month's worth of pocket money in one go. Our youngest immediately asked if she could go to the corner shop to buy sweets with her bank card. We said no.

Today will be spent standing at the touchline of rugby pitches - watching Miss 12 and Miss 13 diving around in the mud, shouting "DEFENSIVE LINE!" like little field marshals, and hopefully having fun.

I will stamp my feet to keep warm, message friends to see how they are doing (complete with spelling mistakes, because I'm hopeless at typing on a mobile phone), and stress out about preparations for work next week. I'm good at silently stressing out. It's a key skill.

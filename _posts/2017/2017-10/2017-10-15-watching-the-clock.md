When I woke at 6am this morning, I instinctively checked my phone for messages, and discovered my flight to Germany had been cancelled. Ten minutes later, while squinting at a computer screen in the dark of the study downstairs, I had re-scheduled to a later flight, and called the taxi company too.

The later flight has now been delayed too. I suppose this is vindication that I set an entire day aside to travel. Taking into account the time-zone change while in the air later, I will now reach the hotel in Germany at perhaps 5pm, after getting up at 6am to get to the airport. The actual flight usually takes a little over an hour.

I have another hour sitting here until the gate is even announced. Maybe I'll read a book. Or provide a running commentary on the people sitting throughout the departure lounge. They're not exactly interesting though (he writes, glancing up) - they all appear as bored as me.

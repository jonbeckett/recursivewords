I just discovered a guy I worked with for several years was killed in a road traffic accident on Sunday morning. His wife is 7 months pregnant. They were good friends.

I called home and told my other half, then emailed all the important people at work. I'm still kind of numb. I can't go near Facebook, because nobody else knows yet.

I'm doing what needs to be done - and wondering how I'm going to concentrate on work this week. I have to stand in front of a room full of strangers for the next few days and be insightful, inspiring, instructive, and all those other words.

I'm not entirely sure how I'm going to do it.

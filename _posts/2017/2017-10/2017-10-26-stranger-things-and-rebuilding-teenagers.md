Tonight is pizza night, and Stranger Things 2 has been released on Netflix. That solves what I'll be watching throughout the weekend. I may stop on my way home to buy some snacks for both myself and Miss 17. We watched the first season together, so it's kind of become "our thing".

Stranger Things has come at the right time to be honest - without sharing too much, I suspect I will need to be there for our eldest quite a bit this weekend. I'm busy filling my bag of parent tricks with things to take her mind off the last few days, and to make her laugh again. An all-night binge-watching TV marathon fueled by chocolate and fizzy drinks might be just the thing.

While writing this post, the washing machine and tumble dryer are rumbling away in the background, I'm half listening to an old playlist on the ancient iMac in the corner of the room, the younger children are playing football with their friends on the green outside the house, our eldest is visiting a friend for the day, and my other half is at the "Knit and Stitch Exhibition" in London.

All should be good with the world, and yet it is not. A number of people I have known for years on the internet are busy ripping lumps out of each other. I'm not going to get into how, or why, or try to make sense of it - I just think it's sad because a community I have known and cherished appears to be ripping itself apart. I guess it's a reminder that nothing lasts forever.

If you like somebody, tell them. If you love somebody, shout it from the rooftops. If you have a significant other, go give them a hug. If you have children, go play with them. If you have a dog, go feed it. If you have a cat, good luck with that, because I very much doubt it gives the tiniest sh*t about you - still give it a cuddle though, because cats look magnificently pissed off when you hug them.

There's enough pain and suffering in this world already - let's try and redress the balance a little.

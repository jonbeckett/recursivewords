I'm thinking about giving"Tiny Letter" a try. It's owned by MailChimp, and is provided as a free service for individuals - it lets people subscribe to you, and then you can write to them in the same way you might for a blog, but obviously it's not published online.It's an interesting idea. It would feel more like writing a letter.

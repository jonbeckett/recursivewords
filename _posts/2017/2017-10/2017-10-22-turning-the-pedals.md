Cycling to work this morning seemed like hard work. It's amazing how sitting in a hotel for a week can take the formerly super-human strength from your legs and hide it somewhere. I guess it doesn't help that I have a few days booked off work this week - which I fully intend to spend sitting on my backside watching movies, and playing board games with the children, who are on half-term.

I spent the greater part of the morning filing an expense claim for the Germany trip. The rules and regulations around what you can claim for, and then converting card transactions to currency are slightly insane. It took two and a half hours.

I caught up with Mr Robot over the weekend - the TV series starring Rami Malek and Christian Slater. I loved the first two seasons, and the third season seems to be taking it on to a whole new level. I wish I knew people that are watching it - sometimes you finish an episode and need to decompress - to talk about it with somebody. I don't have that.

I have nothing to get on with this afternoon. I'm not entirely sure what I'm going to do for the next several hours. If you're at a loose end, give me a shout.

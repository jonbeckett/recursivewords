I returned to the office today after the better part of six weeks either travelling around the country, or sick at home. I will admit to a certain amount of dread when opening my email - I thought I got off remarkably lightly - I only had a couple of emails to actively respond to - the rest were from the resident office geeks, nerding out about a new phone system.

The rest of the day was a write-off. I spent the entire morning sitting in a conference room talking through the project I will be working on for the next several weeks, and then much of the afternoon in a conference call with the client, talking about all the same things again. At some point I'll start actually working on the project, rather than talking about it endlessly (snore).

Thank the maker for mobile phones, and a wonderful friend that randomly started messaging me while I tried to stay awake. She may never know how valued our inane conversation about nothing at all actually was.

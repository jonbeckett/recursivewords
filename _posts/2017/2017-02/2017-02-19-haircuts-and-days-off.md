I had a day of leave booked today, so took the opportunity to get my hair cut. I also took the snap decision to get my hair cut somewhere completely different than normal, and it was... interesting.

I seem to have a peculiar skill that involves strangers starting off by making conversation with me, and then volunteering the entire contents of their head and heart. The tall attractive lady cutting my hair told me all about her struggles with her son while leaning all over me with the scissors.

Here's the thing. When you're kind of trapped in a chair with an attractive woman leaning all over you with a very sharp pair of scissors, and you notice in the mirror that her crotch is getting remarkably close to your elbow, what do you do? I stayed absolutely still. I think I may have even stopped breathing for a time.

I'm not quite sure how I find myself in these situations. Perhaps they don't even exist. It's a little like the movie "Billy Liar", where Tom Courtney imagines the next few seconds of everyday scenes in his life unfolding far more spectacularly than boring reality. I don't think I'll try to imagine any more of the scene I found myself in though...

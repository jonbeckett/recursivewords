Just a few words tonight - mainly because I left the charger for my laptop in a conference room, somewhere in the depths of a very big building across town. I'm sitting in the hotel room typing this, and occasionally looking across at the battery meter on the laptop.

One sleep left, and then I travel home. At some time after lunchtime tomorrow I head back towards London, across the Underground, back out the other side, and through a succession of trains towards home.

I'll be back here by Monday night, and that's all I have to say about that.

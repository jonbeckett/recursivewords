After splashing out on new tyres and inner tubes for my bike a few days ago, I finally got around to giving it a much needed clean, and swapped the tyres over today. I can't really complain - I bought the bike in the spring, and this is the first time I have had to spend any money at all on it.

I also fitted the novel gadget my other half got me for Christmas - an "ass saver" - a flexible piece of mylar type stuff that slots under the saddle, and stops you getting spray up your backside in wet weather. I'll let you know how that goes.

It's now tucked away back in the shed, ready to take me to work in the morning. It may end up back in the shed for the better part of the next month though - my work is going to take me all over the place in the coming weeks. If you start seeing stories about train journeys and hotels, at least you'll know why.

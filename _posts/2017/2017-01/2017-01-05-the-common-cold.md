For the last few days I have been soldiering on in the way countless other parents do, pretty much ignoring my body's attempts to combat a common cold virus that'sbeen doing the rounds for the last few weeks.

I've been living on a cocktail of paracetamol (Tylenol), "Lemsip Max Cold & Flu" powdered drinks, and Lucozade energy drinks. For those that have never experienced Lemsip, just imagine swallowing satan's lemon flavoured spit, turned into a powder, and mixed with boiling water. It works, but it makes me wretch.

I experimented this morning with eating an entire bag of cookies, but that just made me feel sick. While eating them I kept telling myself that they would probably increase energy levels for a while. Perhaps I should try ice cream. And maybe chocolate fudge cake. Why stop there? I'm thinking rice pudding, or maybe a bowl of custard.

You do realise I'm joking, right?

Being half serious, I'm not looking forward to tomorrow at all. Our younger kids are playing in back-to-back football matches in town, meaning I will find myself standing on the touchline of football pitches in the freezing cold for the better part of three hours. I'll probably end up being the linesman again, because very few of the other parents ever hang around to watch - you know, like actually support their children. I don't have a problem with that at all, honest. Much.

Time to go make a final cup of tea before collapsing into bed.

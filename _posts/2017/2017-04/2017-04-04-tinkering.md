In-between putting fires out at work today, I have been tinkering with the archive of my personal blog. Rather than bore you to tears with a tale of teeth gnashing and desk thumping, I'll just announce that you can head to GitHub and read every single post I ever wrote, if you know where to look. What's more, every single post is perfectly formatted in Markdown format, and filed under year and month. Yes, I really am that nerdy.

I've been meaning to do it for a long time, but never quite got around to it. I guess the next project will be to reverse the process, and use the cleanly formatted text files to back-populate my WordPress blog. Or not. I can't decide if it's worth doing, because the only person remotely interested in making sure the back-story is there is me (well, and the usual suspects that stalk everything I write everywhere online but never communicate with me in any way, shape, or form).

Anyway. Enough idiocy for today.

She was always the least sure of herself, the one who worried the most - the one that watched others from a distance. Now she is seventeen, and I'm wondering where the years have gone.

The last two years have been brutal. While her peers forged personalities and ventured out into the world, she retreated. Home became a prison of sorts, and the future often seemed out of reach.

And yet here we are. Seventeen.

A place at college, new friends, new hopes, and new dreams. The last few months haven't so much been a turn-around as a re-invention. A re-boot. A second chance.

Here's to the future, whatever it may bring.

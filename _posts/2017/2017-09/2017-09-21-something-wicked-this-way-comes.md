I suppose technically it's already Saturday morning, but I'm writing this before falling into bed on Friday night, so I'm classing it as Friday still.

I took Miss 17 to see "IT" at the cinema this evening - the movie version of Stephen King's famous book. I've never read the book, and I never saw the TV mini series back in the day, so the story was entirely new for both of us.

Holy shit it scared me. Thinking back, I can't remember seeing a thriller or horror movie at the cinema before - I usually only make it to the big screen for fantasy or science fiction movies. Miss 17 thought it tremendously amusing that I almost left my seat at one point (Pennywise appearance in the bathroom scene, if you are wondering) - I decided not to recall her attempts to crawl into the back of her seat during more than one scene.

Let's avoid doing a capsule review, and just say the movie was great, and has given me a fresh appreciation of how much a good cinema adds to the experience of seeing a good movie. Let's not talk about the assholes you have to share the cinema with though.

Oh. My. God. Why do some people bother paying to see a movie? Why would you pay, and then turn up ten minutes into the movie? Why would you get up to go to the toilet twenty minutes in? Do you have the bladder of a small baby? Several people missed pivotal sections of the movie, and would have no idea what the hell was going on later. Like I said - why spend the money if you're going to wreck the movie for yourself? Why not just wait for the DVD?

Getting back to the movie, I think a part of my affinity for it was based on the era it is set (which differs from the book, apparently). The kids the story centres around are about 13 or 14 years old in 1988. I was 13 or 14 in 1988. They could have been me.

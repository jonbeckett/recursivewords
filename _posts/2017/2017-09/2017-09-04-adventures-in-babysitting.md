In the grand tradition of discovering movies thirty years after everybody else, I finally sat and watched "Adventures in Babysitting" this evening with Miss 16. I finally get it - I get the whole thing about Elizabeth Shue, and I finally understand Jeff Winger in Community making such a big deal about Britta looking like her.

I'm pretty sure the movie will be filed firmly on the shelf labelled "great movies that can be left on in the background that you don't have to pay much attention to", and there's nothing wrong with that - the world needs more of those movies. Movies like "The Breakfast Club", "Sixteen Candles", "Pretty in Pink", and "Some Kind of Wonderful".

Why were we watching "Adventures in Babysitting" in the first place? Because Miss 16 finished her first day of college today, and she wanted to de-stress. We were home alone - the rest of the family was at rugby practice - so I bought ready meals, and we camped out in front of the TV together.

I'm not sure I can put into words how happy we are about the way things are finally turning out. After two years of uncertainty - that have remained conspicuously absent from this blog - we have a happy, smiling sixteen year old that is attending college. We walked into town together to buy food earlier, and she talked non-stop about her day. I can't remember the last time that happened. I'm smiling while writing this.

Oh - one last thing - she's taking on babysitting work locally to make money through college. Let's hope her experiences are a little less exciting than those in the movie.

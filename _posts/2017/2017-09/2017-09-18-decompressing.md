Tonight you find me sitting in the dark of the junk room, listening to the "Favourite Coffeehouse" playlist on Spotify, with an incense stick burning on the corner of the desk. I guess you could call it "decompression".

Most of the day was spent either on the phone, or struggling to figure out how to make something fairly significant work. As often happens, light filled the tunnel minutes before leaving the office, which means I'll at least sleep tonight instead of turning problems over and over in my head.

In vaguely related news, I'm returning to Germany again - perhaps the week after next. I'll know more tomorrow, but have already reserved a hotel room. I really should do something about learning a few more words, because this won't be the last trip. In a curious turn of fate, the better you are at what you do, the more the client wants you to spend time with them.

This evening involved sitting for an hour in the hall of a local school among several hundred other parents, listening to plans for the year ahead. Perhaps the most interesting moment came right at the end when the deputy head spoke to all present about the problems caused by social media, and the need to stop children using screens at least an hour before they go to bed. Our decision to do this a couple of years ago has been vindicated - we thought the research into backlit screens and sleep was well known - apparently not.

Now if you'll excuse me, I have several hundred episodes of Seinfeld to start wading my way though. A promise to a close friend. Apparently I'm going to discover myself, or at least a very good facsimile of various facets of myself. The last time that happened was during the more mundane moments of Mr Robot - minus the drug addictions and multiple personality disorders of course.

Oh - one more thing - I realised earlier that I haven't logged into IMVU for a couple of weeks. I'm not sure why. Perhaps re-joining Tumblr is somehow related to my apathetic rejection of IMVU? Standing in a virtual room full of strangers hiding behind invented facades, having dispassionate conversations about nothing much doesn't really compare to blogging platforms where people are all too real - painting their thoughts, problems, hopes and dreams large.

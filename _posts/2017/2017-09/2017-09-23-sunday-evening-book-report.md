The clock is ticking inexorably towards the end of Sunday evening, and my mind is trying to avoid thinking about work tomorrow. Something didn't work as well as we might have liked on Friday, and it's been at the back of my mind all weekend.

I stayed at home today while my other half camped out on the touchline of a rugby field an hour from home watching the younger girls train with the rest of their squad. While they completed endless drills I filled, emptied, and re-filled the washing machine again and again. It's rapidly turning into "the thing I do" at the weekend, which is fine, until I realise that some people are out with friends, drinking, eating, laughing, and having a great time.

Inbetween chores today I filled my Kindle up with books - or at least I tried to. It turns out Kindles no longer play well with sideloaded books (when you attach the Kindle to the computer via a USB cable, and upload books into it via Calibre). Some of the books appeared, others remained conspicuously absent. I ended up deleting everything and just importing the book I want to read next. I'm trying to arm-twist myself into reading more instead of spending hours surfing the web, or watching TV. The next books will be "IT", followed by "Neverwhere", and then maybe "John dies at the end", which I spotted earlier today.

I still haven't read "The Perks of Being a Wallflower", despite the paperback kicking around the junk room for the last couple of years.

I tried an audio book out while in Germany. The Jerry Pournelle book "The Mote in God's Eye". I thought it might be a good chance to listen to a story while holed up in a hotel, but found it incredibly difficult to concentrate. I think when I read from a page, my mind builds the scene far more solidly than just hearing the words (if that makes any sense).

Maybe my mission until the end of the year should be to read as many of the books on my "to read" list as possible, and actually update Goodreads with progress.

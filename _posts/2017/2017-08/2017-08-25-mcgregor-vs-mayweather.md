I'm sitting in the dark of the junk room at home, debating with myself it it's worth staying up to watch the fight between Connor McGregor, and Floyd Mayweather. If I do stay up, I'll admit now that I'm not going to pay for it - so unless I can find somebody streaming it, I will listen on the radio - BBC Radio are broadcasting live. I still can't believe how much the pay-per-view is going to cost in the US. I think over here it will cost less than half as much.

If I do stay up, I have to find something to amuse myself with for the next four hours - either that, or set the alarm clock and go to bed now.

Decisions, decisions.

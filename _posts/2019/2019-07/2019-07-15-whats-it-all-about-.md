I'm sitting in the dark of the junk room at home, the soft glow of the computer screen lighting my fingers as they dance over the keyboard. I sat down to write a blog post an hour ago, and don't have anything to show for it.

Sometimes I look back at the trail of blog posts that stretch into the distant past, and wonder how I came to write them all - how I kept going - emptying my head - day after day - week after week - month after month.

I wonder what future generations will do with my words? Will they be printed and kept, or will they vanish into the ether as the various online accounts they reside in expire ?

Will these words endure, or will they quietly drift away ?

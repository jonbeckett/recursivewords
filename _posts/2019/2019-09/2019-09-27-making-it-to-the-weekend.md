I've been sitting in the dark of the junk room for last last hour, with every intention of writing something, but instead tinkering with this and that, daydreaming, or just gazing into space. I can't help but remember a stand-up routine by Mickey Flanagan - complaining that getting nothing done is a worthy skill that should be held onto. At least I know I'm good at something though, right ?

It's been a week. Today was another slog - finishing a little after 6pm after working straight through lunch for the fifth day in a row. I wonder what it is about clients that causes them to occasionally forget you're a human being? I'm probably being over-dramatic, but that's how it feels sometimes.

Anyway. We made it through the week more-or-less unscathed. I'm still running myself ragged while my other half recuperates from accidentally putting a swiss army knife through her hand last weekend. It's healing well - but she's still in a lot of pain - surviving on a cocktail of ibuprofen and paracetamol. Tonight she has slept since getting in from work.

In other news I returned to using the bullet journal. I tried to get on with Google Keep - I really did - but ultimately I only seem to remember things if I've written them down. There's something about a paper notebook too - a permanence, and a feeling of crafting something when putting pen to paper. People often comment about my handwriting, but I would typically counter by simply observing that I care about how my writing looks - even if I'm the only person that sees it.

I feel like I should be excited that it's the weekend, but the overwhelming feeling seems to be relief. Relief that I made it to the weekend. Perhaps I'll actually get a chance to catch up with blogs over the next couple of days - to repay the kindness extended by those that have followed my recent adventures, and asked after me.

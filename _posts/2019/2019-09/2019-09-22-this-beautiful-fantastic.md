Late yesterday evening, while looking for a movie to watch with my temporarily incapacitated better half, I stumbled upon perhaps the most wonderful movie I have seen in quite some time. A quiet movie about broken people called "This Beautiful Fantastic".

I'm not going to write a capsule review about the movie - you can find those all over the internet, written by know-it-all movie critics. If you discover this movie, I would like you to discover it in the same way I did - with no expectations - then you can be taken on it's journey too.

Countless moments from the movie have been turning over in my head throughout the night, and this morning. I need to watch it again, so the characters may become old friends.

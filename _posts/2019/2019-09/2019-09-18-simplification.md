I removed all the stock photos from my blog posts earlier. I intended to write about it when I did it (at lunchtime), but one thing after another happened, and I didn't get around to writing anything about it until this evening. I'm writing this at 8:30pm. I suppose the motivation for removing the photos is to simplify. To stop "playing the game".

In other news, Miss 18 became Miss 19 today. I bought curry from the supermarket on the way home from work, and my other half made a cheesecake last night. We all feel sick now - a good sick though. I might have overdone it on the aloo sag and bombay potatoes. I don't think there's such a think as "overdoing it on the cheesecake" - not in this house, anyway.

Oh - nearly forgot - I might have stopped using the bullet journal. I realised I could use Google Keep in almost exactly the same way - to record what I need to do each day, and what needs to be done in the coming days. I say "might" because I still like the idea of a bullet journal - it just seems a bit backwards to keep going with pen and paper when a computer has so many benefits. Even the Moleskine journal has gone untouched for months - if I ever want to empty my head, I tend to do it on the blog - not on paper.

Anyway. Enough pontificating about things that don't really matter.

I read this morning that lots of people are leaving Netflix over their cancellation of "The OA". Apparently the "lots of people" think they are a force to be reckoned with - but in classic myopic internet fashion, don't realise that their algorithmically collated echo chamber community is in the vast minority. Yes, "The OA" was a wonderful show - just like "Halt and Catch Fire", "Community", and a hundred other shows that I talk about with friends and family before discovering that few have ever heard of them. The internet is a bit odd like that. I think maybe some shows are like marmite - you either love them, hate them, or have ever heard of them - and Netflix is only going to carry on paying for things that lots of people are talking about. I suppose if we follow this through to it's conclusion, we'll just end up with reality shows, and various forks of CSI.

Why do crime scene investigation TV shows always have to have such spectacular stories filled with sculduggery, lies, and deceit? Why can't they ever have somebody die because they tripped over ? I don't suppose the episode would last very long though...

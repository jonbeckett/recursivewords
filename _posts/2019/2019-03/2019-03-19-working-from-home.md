I didn't plan on working from home today.It all began when I was cooking bacon for the children's breakfasts at 7am this morning. Miss 18 wasn't getting up, and my other half went to check on her. A few minutes later she returned, with stories of a swollen eye, and calling the doctor to make an appointment. They left on-foot towards the doctors shortly before I left the house - while gathering my things together I noticed a mobile phone on the kitchen counter, and wondered which of the children had left their phone behind.When I got to work (about three miles through the morning traffic mayhem), I was about to take my coat off when my mobile phone erupted into life."Hello ?""Hi Dad - can you come home again?"I don't know why, but I absolutely knew what Miss 18 was going to say next."We've locked ourselves out. Our keys and phones are indoors".I started swearing - my t-shirt was already drenched in sweat after fighting a headwind all the way to work - I could foresee myself having another shower and changing my clothes when I got home."Sorry!""It's ok - I'll be about fifteen or twenty minutes - depending on traffic".And that's how I ended up home again a little while later - except I picked up my laptop from the office along the way - with no intention of returning a second time. I had the second shower too.Now if you'll excuse me, I have some urgent work coffee to get on with.

Earlier this year I holed myself up on an internet island of my own creation for a while. A respite of sorts from the avalanche of conversation that tends to thunder past no matter where you might stand while navigating Twitter, Tumblr, WordPress, Facebook, or wherever else.

Although I have tentatively stepped back towards the raging river - following one or two old friends - I still haven't really "returned" to the social media madness. I'm not sure I ever will.

I can count my posts to Facebook over the last few weeks on the fingers of one hand. The same is true of Twitter. I still post to Instagram whenever I have something interesting to share, but even those "somethings" are becoming sporadic at best.

I'm not sure I have a point to make. I'm not sure there is a point to make. A little voice in my head tries to tell me that putting one foot in front of the other will ensure that everything turns out alright in the end. I'm not sure I believe it.

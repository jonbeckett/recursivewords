I'm having a night off from "the blog" tonight. I've been sitting here, staring at the screen for the last half hour, coming up with this and that - but nothing of substance. It's kind of like when you get to the end of a jar of peanut butter or chocolate spread, and can't quite scrape enough out to put on your toast.I don't have enough story inside my head this evening to turn into a blog post.I'm sure there ARE lots of stories buried inside my head - they just don't want to be shared right now, obviously.

It's Wednesday the 20th March 2019. I'm sitting at my desk in the office. I've been half-watching my email in-box all morning. I've made two cups of coffee for everybody so far, and I've already eaten the packed lunch I made for myself. I have no idea what I'm going to write about, but let's see where this goes.

(an hour and a half passes)

This browser tab has been open for the last hour and a half, and I've got no closer to writing anything. Perhaps this is how the universe attempts to tell me that I really shouldn't try to empty my head when there's not much to share.

(another minute passes while I try to think if there is anything I might share)

I think the battery on my Amazon Kindle is dead. I charged it up the other night, and noticed it didn't charge to 100% - then once disconnected from the power, started dropping like a stone. It is about four years old. I still have the Fire tablet to read with, so it's not a disaster, but it has made me think twice about buying electronic books again. Although the Kindle is convenient while travelling, I've always preferred paper books - probably always will. There's just something about sitting with a real book in your hands - I'm not sure if it's the weight of it in your hands, or the smell, or what.

I looked briefly at the the new Kindles on the Amazon website, and then caught myself - thinking "do I REALLY need one?". Of course I don't. I find myself thinking this about a lot of things at the moment.

I guess I should get on with some work. Or maybe another coffee for everybody.

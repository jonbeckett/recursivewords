It's just gone 10pm on Sunday evening. My bags are packed, and I'm ready to go once again. Tomorrow morning I will get up a little after 6am, and go through the usual routine ahead of a taxi arriving outside the house. I will make friendly conversation with the driver for an hour before arriving at Heathrow Airport on the outskirts of London. A couple of hours later I will depart the surly bonds of earth, eat a pre-packed sandwich handed to me by an invariably pretty girl with a Germanic name, and then land at Frankfurt airport early in the afternoon. An hour later I will depart the airport and hopefully board a train headed towards the city, before walking half a mile to the hotel - dragging my case behind me. I will arrive, pick up my room key, and unpack my case before walking to a nearby Japanese restaurant, sitting down, and ordering food without looking at the menu.

I've done this all before. Many times.

All I have left to do this evening is fill the Amazon Fire table with movies and TV shows to entertain me during the week of evenings ahead. Perhaps I'll have a shave too - one less thing to do in the morning - one less thing to worry about.

Expect a blog post from the departure terminal at Heathrow.

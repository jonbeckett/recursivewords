Two of my family informed me this morning that they are going "sugar free" for March, so I thought I might join them on their crusade. By "sugar free" they just mean processed sugar - so we will still be allowed to eat fruit, and drink wine, for example. There will also be several days where sugar is allowed - owing to a couple of birthdays, and a dinner party we have been invited to.Being honest, I don't think I'm going to miss processed sugar at all. I only tend to eat chocolate when we have it in the house, and I haven't had sugar in hot drinks for years.Just to mix things up, I'm also stopping caffeine for the month too - no tea or coffee. I've done it before, and didn't find it difficult at all. Sure, I'll have a headache for a day or two while my body gets back to normal, but after that it just means I'll be tired in the afternoon (I'm tired right now - writing this in the last hour of the work day while waiting for files to backup). Instead of drinking coffee or black tea I'll just switch to water, orange juice, or redbush tea.At the end of the month I'll write another post with any thoughts about how it went. I can't imagine it's going to be that  difficult (he says, daydreaming about a bar of chocolate).

I have never let the absence of anything interesting or exciting going on in my life stop me from writing at length about it, and I'm not about to start now. Or maybe I am, because I have no clue what I might write about - just a nagging feeling that I should write something, because that's what I do.

We went to the running club tonight - our second session of "Couch to 5K" shenanigans, where the interval time was increased from four minutes running to six minutes running. I have to keep reminding myself that I'm doing it to support my daughter - even though there's a tremendous temptation to sneak off and do a 5K, if only to have some half-decent numbers appear in the running app I installed on my phone.

Anyway. It's getting late. Time to go fall down internet rabbit holes for an hour instead of falling asleep.

Maybe something exciting will happen tomorrow.

I went out running with my eldest daughter again this evening - another ten sets of two minutes running, one minute walking. Our next run will be on Tuesday night at the running club in town - heading out onto the streets with the unlikely band of "Couch to 5K" runners. I still feel a bit like a fraud, given that I can probably run 5K now at quite a clip - I have to keep reminding myself that I'm not doing it for me.

I haven't told my daughter that she ran considerably faster tonight. As predicted, being thirty years younger means she's getting better remarkably quickly. It will be interesting to see how her will power is when the run lengths increase.

What else has been going on today?

I wasted a couple of hours playing Minecraft this afternoon. After getting the chores done around the house I vanished into the pretend world, and completely lost track of time. Falling into lava by accident and burning to death served as a wake-up call of sorts. I haven't logged back in since.

(When you die in Minecraft, everything falls out of your pockets - so anything your character had about their person can be retrieved. Unfortunately if you fall in lava, everything burns. Ergo - I lost quite a number of imaginary things that are of no consequence to the real world, so I don't know why I'm even telling you).

How on earth is it 10pm on Sunday night already ? Where did the weekend go ? I'm tempted to stay up all night playing retro games - I installed a number of emulators for long-forgotten systems on my old laptop the other night. I got them working, but didn't get around to playing any games.

I think perhaps before I do that I'll go make a coffee. Coffee always seems like the best way to start any damn fool activity late at night.

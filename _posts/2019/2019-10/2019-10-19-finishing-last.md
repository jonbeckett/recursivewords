We attended yet another fund-raiser quiz last night - this time for the local hockey team. My other half put a call out on social media for team mates, and we quickly found ourselves with a table of seven - we would have been eight, but our middle daughter was waiting tables - or rather, up-selling bottles of wine and packets of peanuts to the various parents in attendance.

We finished LAST out of perhaps ten teams - off the back of WINNING the junior school fund-raiser quiz two weeks ago. Go figure. To be honest, we knew by half-way through the evening that we had no chance, and convinced each other that it was more about having a cheap night out than anything else. I drank far too much wine, and had quite an impressive headache first thing this morning.

The peanuts were called "Nobby's Nuts", which caused all manner of entirely predictable propositions as they were offered around the table - "do you like Nobby's Nuts?" - or just plain "do you want some of my nuts?". Yes, we all have the humor of a thirteen year old after a few glasses of wine.

Today has been all about watching the Rugby World Cup on the television, and getting washing done. Our poor old washing machine must dread weekends. It's been forced through about five loads so far today, and as Curly said in City Slickers - "day ain't over yet".

After walking nearly 5K to and from work today (thanks Mr Farmer for puncturing my bike tyres with your hedgerow annihilation device), I ate dinner, washed up, and then immediately got changed into my bargain basement running kit to head out with Miss 19.

We have been tasked with running "intervals" every other day inbetween the weekly meet-ups at the running club in town. This week we have to do ten sets of two minutes running, and one minute walking.

Here's the funny thing - Miss 19 really, really didn't want to go out this evening. Somehow I arm-twisted her into it, even though it was spitting with rain outside, and pretty damn cold. The complaints came thick and fast - "I've got a stitch", "my legs hurt", "I can't do this"...

Here's the even funnier thing - ten minutes later, her entire mood had turned around. She realised she COULD do it, and was DOING it. She ran every interval, didn't cheat at all, and ended the evening with a huge smile on her face.

I'm SO proud of her.

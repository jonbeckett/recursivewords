After work this evening I headed out with Miss 19 and put another few kilometres in the bank. I'm not sure what she's been eating - it might have something to do with her being nearly thirty years younger than me - but she FLEW tonight. Of course she complained that this hurt, or that hurt, but she FLEW.

So. Running done. Kitchen cleared up. Kids ominously quiet. Time to sit in the junk room listening to spotify and attempt to come up with a few insightful or entertaining words. Except of course I don't really do insightful or entertaining any more - it's more humdrum, chores, frustrations, and the struggle is real.

I sometimes look at other people's blogs, and think "how do they DO that" - and then I realise they don't work, and appear to have a magically bottomless bank account, which funds restaurant meals, endless clothes shopping expeditions, and a camera that cost more than our car to take photos of it all - filed everywhee with a "#nofilter" tag.

I'm not bitter. Just jaded I suppose. Cynical. Tired.

No matter how hard I try, I always seem to end up back where I started. Getting ahead is temporary - I have learned that now. It always seems to involve luck rather than hard work. Maybe the world just works that way - some people work their arse off and get nowhere, whereas some people fall on their feet continually. Maybe that Bruce Willis movie "Unbreakable" was right - balance extends to everything.

Spotify just stopped. I wonder if that means I've listened to all of it now ?

(a few moments pass while I pick another playlist)

I just noticed the "Favourite Coffeehouse" playlist has vanished. Dammit. You know sometimes you just want a not-too-terrible playlist on in the background that you don't hate too much? That was the favourite coffeehouse playlist for me. What am I going to do now? I'm not sure I can be bothered to curate anything.

In other news, I downloaded all of the old Infocom text adventure games to my laptop at lunchtime. I'm about to go sit on the sofa in the living room with it and open the mailbox to the west of an old white house. If you guessed the game, you win the nerd lottery.

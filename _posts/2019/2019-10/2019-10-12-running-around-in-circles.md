After getting in from work last night (and eating home-made pizza), I finally made it out with Miss 19 for a training run - the one that was supposed to have happened the night before. It didn't really go to plan - she had her first "bad run" - but the important thing was that she got out there and did something at least. It all counts, I suppose.

Today the roof of the world seems to be falling on us - rain has been drumming off the flat roof all night, and all morning so far. My other half is still sitting in bed with a book - I'm up and about, getting chores done, and procrastinating with this post. The kids had a friend stay for a sleepover last night - they were all up at ridiculous o'clock.

(ten minutes pass while I re-load the washing machine, hang clothes in the air dryer, and make a coffee)

I weighed myself a little over a week ago (for the first time in years), and then again a couple of days ago - to see if all the running, and not eating so much rubbish was having an effect. Somehow I lost 5 pounds in a week. This is obviously an anomaly, because nobody loses weight that fast, but at least it proves something to the kids. I probably have about 20 pounds to lose until I'm anywhere near where I should be.

In other news, I've been informed that we're off to see Bill Bryson tonight. He's doing some sort of "audience with" thing in Oxford - I'm guessing to help sell his latest book (that I spotted in a book shop last weekend). I nearly bought a copy, before reminding myself about the leaning tower of unread books on my bedside table.

Anyway. Better get on I suppose. Thanks for reading if you did

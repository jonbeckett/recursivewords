After a day spent cheering on both of our younger daughters at back-to-back rugby matches this afternoon (literally back-to-back - they were playing on parallel pitches - while I watched our youngest in the under-15s, my other half watched our middle girl in the under-18s), I went out for a training run this evening.

Given that our eldest - Miss 19 - has somehow injured her knee, I went running alone for the first time since the Couch to 5K programme started. Finally a chance to find out what my legs and lungs really can do after ten years not running further than the toilet while busting.

On the training programme we are still doing intervals - running for a few minutes and then walking for a minute. I decided to find out tonight if I can skip the intervals.

I'm not going to lie. After perhaps the first couple of kilometres, it became hard work. I wondered if it was because I was running at my natural pace, or because I had been stood on a touchline in the cold for previous three hours.

Quite bizarrely, after fighting through the third kilometre it suddenly became easier - but then much harder towards the end of the fifth. I could feel muscles starting to tighten up here and there, so slowed to a gentle jog as I approached home. I guess I'll find out if there is any lasting damage in the morning.

I'm mostly happy. I ran a consistent speed throughout, and have confirmed that yes - I can still run 5K at least. In a strange sort of way, I find running more slowly than my natural pace quite difficult. During the training runs we seem to naturally cover the ground at about 8.5 minutes per kilometre. Tonight I travelled at 6 with an almost metronomic consistency.

I guess the next thing for me - after the Couch to 5K thing is over - will be to go out to 5 miles, and then beyond. I really need to lose the extra 20lb of weight I'm carrying around before that happens though. I guess doing the park runs will help with that (and banning myself from eating so much rubbish for a while).

Anyway. It's half past my bedtime. Time to stop writing, and go sleep.

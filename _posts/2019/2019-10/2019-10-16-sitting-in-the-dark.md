I have been sitting in the dark of the junk room in front of the keyboard for an hour. Nothing seems to be making it through my fingers and into the keyboard. I'm not entirely sure why - I don't think I have a lot on my mind.

I put in a request for a week off work - for the week after next - half term week. After a seemingly endless slog through two long software and web development projects over the last couple of years I have amassed a huge number of holiday days. It's time to burn through some of them.

I have no idea what I might do with the time off - the museums in London are always a good day out (and free!). There are lots of galleries too - all within walking distance of each other. Half the challenge will be exploding the kids out of bed to come with me.

I've got half an eye on doing a park run soon too. I'm not sure if my eldest daughter will be up for it, but if she is I suppose we'll use it as our weekend training run - and do intervals as-per-normal. I've never done a park run before, so have no pre-conceived ideas of how they are organised. I have a bar-code printed out that identifies me - apparently I can buy a key fob or wrist band with the barcode on to make things a little easier.

How is it nearly 11pm already? Yes, I know the kitchen and lounge were wrecked when I got in from work, but they didn't take THAT long to clear up, did they ? Perhaps they did.

Maybe I should switch the computer off, grab a book, and have an early night (he says, not missing the irony of writing that at 11pm). It's kind of early for me though - I rarely go to bed before midnight - often the early hours. Of course I pay for it the next day, and never learn.

Perhaps a cup of tea first.

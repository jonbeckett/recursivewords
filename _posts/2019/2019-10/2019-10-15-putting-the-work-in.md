Four sets of six minutes running, and one minute walking around the back streets of town this evening with the running club. The running intervals are slowly ramping up. I'm guessing the ultimate aim is to get the group running for half an hour without rest.

It's been interesting to run along near the back, watching the behaviour of the rest of the group. Some naturally gravitate to the front, and others to the back - and while you might think that's driven mostly by each individual's level of fitness, I'm beginning to wonder if there's more going on. Two guys in particular push their way to the front continually - even after being looped to the back in order to make the slower runners feel better about themselves. I guess for some people it really is all about "me", rather than "us".

Anyway - super proud of Miss 19 this evening. She completed the intervals without cheating. For a time I drifted away from her - leaving her running with strangers on purpose - hoping that peer pressure would kick in (it did). She learned a valuable lesson too - that after the initial wave of tiredness passes, running becomes all about rhythm - longer runs are actually easier than shorter intervals.

After saying goodnight to the group, I walked across the park to the hockey pitches, and found our 15 year old waiting at the edge of the pitches with her goal tender kit in an enormous bag by her feet. After shaking her coach's hand and introducing myself, I hefted the bag onto my back and began the mile and a half walk home. My other half was supposed to be picking her up, but had got timings wrong - she found herself waiting on the touchline of a football pitch a few miles away, waiting for Miss 14 to finish training with her team.

It's now ticking past 10pm, and I'm sitting in the dark of the junk room at home. The shower has just shut down for the night. I imagine the washing machine will be full of towels again in the morning - it feels like the washing is never-ending.

I could murder a bar of chocolate, but I'm "being good". Why do I have to hold myself accountable - why can't I cave like everybody else and stuff my face with secret chocolate? lol

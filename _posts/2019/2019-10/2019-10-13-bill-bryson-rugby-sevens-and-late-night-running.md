On Saturday night we visited Oxford - the city I think of as my real home - to see Bill Bryson present a show at the New Theatre in George Street. I had no pre-conceptions going in, other than it might follow the format of so many other "an audience with" type productions - and I was more or less right.

If you've not read any of Bill Bryson's books, I urge you to do so - from "The Lightning Bolt Kid", about growing up in rural Des Moines, Idaho, to "Notes from a Small Island", about living in England, to "I'm a Stranger Here Myself", about his return to live in the US with his family after twenty years in England. He has written many, many books, and they are without exception brilliant.

The evening in the theatre flew by - wrapped in stories about Bill's various adventures, and delivered in a self deprecating humor, mischievousness, and irreverence that has become his trademark. The anecdote about Russell Crowe writing him a fan letter that turned into a drink in London, and then lead to an acting masterclass at Durham University where Bill had been invited to act as Chancellor was one of those stories that could never be made up - because you see Durham University doesn't have a drama course at all - and Russell Crowe still doesn't know that.

During the interval, halfway through the theatre show, I looked around the audience, and a scene stuck in my mind. On the edge of the first tier of seats above us, a young man - perhaps twenty years old - was standing, leaning on the wall, engrossed in his mobile phone. Standing directly in front of him was the most strikingly beautiful girl I have seen in quite some time - I'm guessing his girlfriend. She looked a little lost, gazing at him, and occasionally across the audience below - while he continued to obsess over whatever was on his phone. When will the millennials wake up and realise that life exists outside of their phones? It was both the best and worst illustration of the problem the mobile internet has caused that I've ever seen.

This morning (Sunday) we headed off around London on the M25 towards St. Albans, and a rugby "Sevens" tournament for Miss 14 and 15. My other half has somehow been enlisted as the club medic, given the training she has received through work (she's the lady that decides to call ambulances at the infant school, along with 1001 other duties).

Nobody could have guessed that we would end up calling for two ambulances.

Our girls were fine - our youngest scored a cracking try - running the length of the pitch, and our middle girl threw herself into perhaps the most spectacular tackle I have seen - taking down the opposition's biggest player in a do-or-die last-girl-standing defence of the try-line. Unfortunately at least two families we know through the team ended up in accident and emergency at nearby hospitals.

After getting home from rugby, emptying the car, cooking dinner, and clearing the decks, I went out for another training run with our eldest daughter. Another set of intervals around the back-streets of the town. Given the bad run earlier in the week, I was somewhat apprehensive, but in the end everything worked out fine. We went slowly, I distracted her throughout, and she completed the intervals with a smile on her face. She's starting to suffer from shin-splints, but I'm guessing that will sort itself out over the coming weeks - she's getting fitter and faster, and putting more strain on her legs.

Looking at the clock, it's somehow now 11pm on Sunday evening. The weekend has gone. I'm wondering about grabbing a bowl of cereals before bed - give my body some fuel to help re-build me ready to go again in the morning.

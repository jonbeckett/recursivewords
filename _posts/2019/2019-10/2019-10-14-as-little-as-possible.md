When I went out for the regular training run last night, I knew there was some tightness in my chest, but dismissed it as a virus of some kind - all sorts have been doing the rounds at work, so it would be no suprise if I had caught something or other.

And then I woke this morning finding it difficult to breathe in properly.

I emailed work, and informed them I was taking a day off. Of course then while setting "out of office" on my work phone I spotted an email from a client, and had to fight every instinct to get changed, jump on my bike, and cycle in.

The world can wait for once. I've been warned more than once by friends that always putting everybody else first all the time is a recipe for disaster. The torrential rain throughout the day may also have influenced my decision.

Here's the thing - sitting quietly at home and doing nothing is REALLY difficult. I will admit I didn't actually do "nothing" - I filled the washing machine about five times, and tidied up around the house throughout much of the afternoon. For the rest of the time though - as little as possible.

I'm not good at "as little as possible".

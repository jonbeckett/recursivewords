I think my body might actually be starting to stage a fight-back. I have felt better today than I have in several weeks. The snotty nose has gone, and breathing appears to be possible again - you know, without exploding in a coughing fit when doing something as strenuous as standing up.

Of course my work sensed this return to form, and decided to pull the rug out from beneath me quite spectacularly. The development environment I have been using for the last several months decided to lose it's shit in quite the most sneaky, unsuspecting way you might ever imagine. I'm looking forward to a full server rebuild tomorrow, with no confidence that it will solve anything.

The running club have also been in touch - the group Miss 19 and I have been running with over the last several months are "graduating" tomorrow night - running a 5K route around town together. I replied that I will wander down and run with them - without Miss 19. I'm already wondering about signing her up for the next "Couch to 5K" programme, with the hope that she will find it easier, and I'll hopefully remain fit and well for ten consecutive weeks. Fingers crossed.

Did I mention that I stopped using the bullet journal? It seems like a shame in some ways - I had used it pretty consistently over the last couple of years. I guess I came to the realisation that for my purposes - keeping a daily log of what I have done - Evernote is much better suited, and perhaps most importantly, is searchable. That being said, I might resurrect my old lined paper notebook - for those moments when you have an idea and no computer nearby. If I'm going to do that, I should probably add a new moleskine notebook to my Amazon wish-list.

The night before last Miss 19 wandered into the junk room with her old laptop under her arm - the one she has never used. She inherited a Chromebook some time ago, and has always had a PC under her desk - it doubles as a television to binge-watch YouTube and Netflix. So I have a skinny little laptop to decide what to do with. I might look at installing Elementary OS (a minimal Linux distro) on it. We'll see.

Anyway - it's getting late. Time to go read a little, and try not to think about the server re-build in the morning. Oh - and before I forget - thank-you to everybody that has come out to bat for me while I've been unwell in recent weeks. You have no idea how much your comments, messages, and emails have been appreciated.

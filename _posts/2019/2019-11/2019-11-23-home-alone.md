The rest of the family have gone to the cinema to watch the new Frozen movie. I'm staying at home in the warm (and will be tomorrow too). I've now been sick for a month, on and off. It's not funny any more. I don't actually feel too bad - I just start coughing as soon as I do anything. I'm guessing that's something to do with a chest infection, and will just take time.

I have plans to binge watch the new BBC version of "His Dark Materials" tonight - or at least as many episodes as they have made so far. I've heard good things about it.

I think a cup of tea might be needed first.

I feel like I've fallen off the blogging bike again. In a strange sort of way, the longer you don't post anything for, the less you have to say when you return - or rather, the more difficult it becomes to know where to start.

So. My parents came to stay. They only stayed for one night - renting a room at a local pub - but while they were here all we did was eat, drink, tell stories, and laugh. It was lovely to see them.

While out for dinner on Wednesday night our eldest daughter realised she had no ID with her, so couldn't have a drink with her meal. And that'show we ended up going back to the hotel with Mum and Dad for a nightcap - propping the bar up there until well past midnight.

There was no let-up - the next morning I had agreed to meet up for breakfast with them before they left, so walked back across town with our youngest daughter, and tucked into a "full English breakfast" - which did wonders for my hangover. I really can't drink any more - I only had three glasses of cider during the previous night, but it was enough.

Much of yesterday was spent installing a new computer at home. Part of the reason for my parents visit was to give me Dad's old computer. He has recently bought a new one - a rocket ship by any other name - and called me one day to offer me the old one. I nearly bit his hand off. This of course means the old computer that has been with me through thick and thin now sits forlornly in the corner of the room, waiting to have it's brain erased before being donated to a good cause.

Today has been a strange day really. More tinkering, but also a walk across town with my eldest daughter to visit a physiotherapist. After a few weeks doing the Couch to 5K programme, her leg started hurting - enough to reduce her to tears. Today we found out why. She has a bad habit of sitting on her foot while using the computer - which in turn has tilted her hips somewhat - and the imbalance in her hips has caused the knee problem.

She has strict instructions not to sit on her foot any more.

I have a feeling tonight may be pizza night. It is Friday after all, and Friday night is pizza night - or at least it used to be. A pizza, a movie, and an early night may be just what the doctor ordered.

p.s. I have already installed a flight simulator on the really quite idiotic computer my Dad gave me. All bets are off about the early night.

p.p.s. I have a rotten cold. I've had it all week. How does that even work? Every time I have time off work, I'm sick throughout.

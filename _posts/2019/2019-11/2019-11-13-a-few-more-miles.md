I went to the running club again this evening, and put a few more miles in the bank. I quietly got on with the run, and kept half an eye on Miss 19. I'm not sure what I expected to be honest - I thought she might struggle towards the end, and she did, but she did well, considering how many training sessions she has missed in recent weeks.

Since returning I have somehow spent three hours achieving very little. I read the news, caught up a little with the various social networks, and filled the washing machine. Oh - I also emptied my nose about twenty thousand times - the cold is STILL hanging on.

This post has so far taken well over an hour to write.

Maybe tomorrow will be better.

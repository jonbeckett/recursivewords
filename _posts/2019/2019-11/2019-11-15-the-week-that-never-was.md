I returned home from work on Wednesday lunchtime, and went straight to bed. Actually, that's not entirely true - I cleared the kitchen, tidied the lounge and hallway, put washing in the machine, and hung damp washing out to dry before going to bed.

I worried on Wednesday night that it might be flu - I couldn't get warm, and my body started to ache. Thankfully the aches had vanished by mid-morning the next day. I briefly contemplated coming back into the office, but then thought "to hell with it". It's rare that I get sick, and I usually just soldier on - putting one foot in front of the other.

I spent much of yesterday sitting on the couch with Miss 19. She's had a pretty tough time recently - the anxiety issues she has battled for the last several years have returned with a vengeance. We never know from one day to the next how the next day might unfold. Yesterday we were quite the pair - she fell asleep on one end of the couch, while I made endless cups of tea, and tip-toed to the bathroom to blow my nose repeatedly. We binge-watched Silicon Valley (or rather, I did).

Today I am back in the office. I'm having trouble focusing on anything. Hence taking a few minutes out to write this (in reality, I'm waiting for an installation PowerShell script to run on a virtual server - you really didn't need to know that though).

What else has been going on? Nothing really. I feel like I've fallen off the internet horse, and fallen out of the loop of those I know. I haven't emailed or chatted with anybody in days. I looked in on the various social internet sites earlier, and realised there's no way I'll ever be able to catch up.

Of course I'll spend the entire evening now holed up in front of the TV with a laptop, madly reading, commenting, liking, and all the other things - because I'm an idiot like that.

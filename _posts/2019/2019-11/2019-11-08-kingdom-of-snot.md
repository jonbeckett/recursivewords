I'm at home. I emailed work this morning and let them know I wouldn't be in. My head seems to be in the curious position of generating vast quantities of snot, but bunging up anywhere it might leave from. I imagine my entire head will explode at some point this evening in true "B-Movie" fashion - if only to relieve the pressure.

While the washing machine rumbles away in the background, I'm sitting in the junk room listening to Spotify, drinking Lucozade, and trying not to get involved in doing too much. Quite how I managed to run around town throwing a constant stream of distraction and encouragement at Miss 19 yesterday evening is anybody's guess. I suppose this is the universe's way of telling me that ignoring a cold is a bad idea. Stupid universe.

Now if you'll excuse me, I have a washing machine to empty, another cup of tea to make, and a book to go and quietly read.

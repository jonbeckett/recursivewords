I went Christmas shopping with our eldest daughter today - armed with a list written late last night by my other half. Of COURSE this was how I wanted to spend my week off. OF COURSE it is.

We nearly didn't get there. There is a bus stop about five minutes walk from our house - after consulting the timetable we left the house with a few minutes to spare, and wondered how long it might be until the bus appeared. We stamped our feet in the cold, pulled our collars up, and glanced around at everybody else waiting for the bus. They were all beginning to complain to each other. Old people in England like nothing more than complaining about something - it's like a national sport. Of course they will never complain to the subject of their annoyance - only to each other. While the small congregation busied themselves with grumbling incessantly we looked at our phones, and figured out the next bus was ten minutes away (you know, because of GPS, Google Maps, and all that kind of thing). We didn't tell any of the old people - listening to them complain was more fun.

Needless to say, a bus finally did turn up, and the old people started complaining that there would be nowhere to sit. You really can't win in their world.

Today I discovered that going to the shops in the middle of the week is unexpectedly wonderful. You can wander from shop to shop, pick things up, look at them, and not get walked into, pushed into, tripped, or otherwise harangued by a million and one people who are all far more important than you.

Miss 19 retrieved my other half's hand-written list from her pocket, and we set off.

I would love to say that it was easy - that we skipped from shop to shop, getting everything on the list before jumping on the next bus home. Life never quite works like that - we made it through one clothes shop before Miss 19 turned from "happy go lucky" to "everything is rubbish". The only way to turn her mood around - discovered by much trial and error over the years - was to buy her a hot drink and a cake from a cafe. While she munched on an enormous gluten free muffin, I inquired "are you going to cheer up now?", and she smiled. Well - she smiled as much as you can with a face full of muffin.

Over the next couple of hours we bought bath bombs, pajamas, slippers, books - the usual presents that people open and do their best to react well to. Christmas has turned into that, hasn't it - something that you have to get through - that you have to react well to.

After shopping we had lunch at Wagamama - a faux Asian restaurant chain that sits you on long benches, and serves incredibly expensive street food. It kept Miss 19 quiet. I can't even remember then name of what I ordered - I forgot at the time too - the server bringing the food out had to go and double check that what was in his hand really was what I had ordered (it was).

The bus journey home was altogether less eventful. The bus almost arrived on time - to the note of several old people, who complained that it had parked in the wrong bay at the bus station. While waiting to get on the bus, I thought it might be a shame if everything worked and they had nothing to complain about - it would reduce them to complaining about the weather - or maybe their various ailments.

Anyway.

I'm going to stop writing now, because I'm going to the corner shop to buy a bottle of wine. Then I'm going to watch TV. Possibly all night. Because I can.

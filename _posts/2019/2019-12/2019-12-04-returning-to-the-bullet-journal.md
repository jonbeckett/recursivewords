After dithering quite considerably over the past several months, I have returned to using a bullet journal. There was a huge temptation to dick around with a mixture of Google Calendar, Evernote, and whatever else, but at the end of the day it comes down to one thing - if I don't write things down, I don't remember them.

Yes, yes - I know - the whole point of writing something down, or typing something into some gadget or other, is so you don't have to remember it. I know. The whole point of a bullet journal though is the regimen of planning your day, your week, your month, or even your year. Oh - hang on - that's the lyrics to the title track from Friends, isn't it. You know what I mean though. It's about forming a habit around recording what you want to get done today - and checking what you wanted to get done in the past - to see if it needs to happen any time soon. I suppose some people might call it mindfulness.

It strikes me that Google Calendar, and Evernote, and all the other things are the opposite of mindfulness - they are procrastination enablers. You can just throw your stuff in there, and forget all about it. I've done it. I'm still doing it. Which is why I'm stopping it.

Anyway. All I really set out to say is that I've gone back to using the Bullet Journal. It's not going to be full of pretty pictures and illustrated pages like the wonderful creations you might see at Pinterest - it's just an enormous pile of lists. Things to do this week. Things to do today. Books to read one day. Movies to watch when I find them. TV shows to fool myself into thinking I have time to watch, when in reality I will spend every spare hour dicking around on the internet, rather than actually watching anything that everybody else is going on about.

I'll shut up now.

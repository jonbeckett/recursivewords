I seem to have fallen into a pattern of posting every other day at the moment. This is not intentional. Hell - posting every day was never really intentional - but I suppose it became a "thing" after a while. During the last year I probably went more than a month at various points without missing a day. I'm not sure if that's something to be celebrated or not - I can't imagine I had anything interesting or insightful to share every day, and I'm certainly not going to go back and look. I know that sounds lazy, but I've always seen the blog as a forward moving thing - not retrospective at all.

Wow. This got introspective quickly. I'll blame the glass of rum I just downed - backed up by a pint of beer earlier this evening, and half a bottle of red wine. We're slowly working our way through the "Christmas Drink" - the various bottles we bought in order to have something on hand should visitors drop-in. At the rate we're going, we will still be working on this project at Easter. I think there might be an untouched bottle of Baileys in the cupboard - and a bottle of brandy. Somehow we have ended up with three bottles of mulled wine - one from each of the last several years. The hassle of warming it on the stove prevents us from ever bothering with it - and yet we both like it.

I started playing "Skyrim" again this evening. Our middle daughter is about to turn 15, and has been asking about the various games she might play now - I pointed her in the direction of Oblivion (the game that came before Skyrim) first - and will hold Skyrim back for a while. I bought it when it was released, but somehow never quite got that involved in it. I'm like that with most games, to be honest - once I figure out how they work, I lose interest. I also see games as a bit of a waste of time, I suppose - which is ridiculous, because I write this blog - which doesn't really benefit anybody either. I suppose it stops me going mad - or at least that's what I tell myself.

Anyway. The glass of rum is now empty. Maybe a coffee to level everything off, and then a movie or a book. I started writing a list of books I want to read this year earlier - most of them have been propped on the shelf behind me for quite some time - bought on an impulse, and never quite gotten around to.

Maybe I should give Skyrim to my middle daughter now, and start looking at that list of books? Or maybe I should go make a coffee.

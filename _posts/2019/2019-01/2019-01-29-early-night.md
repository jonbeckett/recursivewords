You know how you promise yourself an early night, but somehow one thing after another crops up, and before you know it the clock is ticking towards half past ten, and you've only just sat down ? It doesn't help that I'm my own worst enemy - walking from room to room picking things up, and putting things away. Then you start doing chores - putting washing in the machine - hanging more washing out to dry - folding dry clothes into hopefully correct piles on the dining table. It never ends.

Anyway. I really am going to stop writing now, and creep off to bed. If I don't, I'll still be here in two hours time, having fallen down a Wikipedia rabbit hole, or become sucked into some Ted talk or other on YouTube.

p.s. it was parents evening at the school this evening. Miss 15 is doing fine.

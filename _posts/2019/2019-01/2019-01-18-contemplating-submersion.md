I'm contemplating submerging my blog once again - disassociating it with the "real world" me - disconnecting my name from it. I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not.

There's a part of me that likes being transparent. I'm a pretty open book - those that find me on the internet can easily connect the dots between the various versions of me on social platforms - I have the same name everywhere - my real name.

There's another part of me that wishes I could share more though - to tell stories about daily life, and complain bitterly and endlessly about everything and everybody. It would serve no useful purpose of course - but the idea of doing it is somehow attractive.

What if I became famous for the assumed identity though, rather than the real me? (har har - like this blog will ever become famous?!) - and what if I was outed by the press? There is a part of me that wonders if some of the people I know on the internet might be much closer friends if I wasn't here as "me" - if I had at least the vestiges of anonymity surrounding my online existence.

I often read stories written by others - people I may never come to know in the real world - who's name I may never know - and am jealous of the freedom anonymity affords them - but at the same time worry I might make a mistake should I attempt anything similar.

Being "me" is easy. Being somebody else would probably be incredibly difficult.

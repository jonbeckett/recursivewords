It's funny how the universe works sometimes. After discovering our eldest daughter in floods of tears last night, I suggested a late night movie on the sofa armed with endless cups of tea might help a little. A distraction. I'm good at distractions.

There was only one problem - what movie to watch? Quite by chance, we stumbled upon the best movie any of us had seen in quite some time. We'll forget that it meant we collapsed into bed at 2am, and that we then got up at 7am this morning - that's just our own stupidity at work. The movie though, was something else.

It was called "The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society", and seemed to star a number of both legendary, and up-and-coming actors. As the titles rolled, my other half sat down with us, and said "Oh, I read the book of this - it was wonderful".

Here's the trailer:

I don't want to ruin the plot too much (and the trailer doesn't either, for a change) - but I will perhaps volunteer that the movie presses every button going. By the end we all had tear stained cheeks, caused through all manner of emotions - sadness, happiness, hope, elation, loss and despair. I've never known a movie quite like it.

There's something about the story - about books, writing, reading, and people - that connects with my core - that bypasses all of the walls I typically surround myself with. There is a romance - a power that the written word carries, that little else can compare to - and the movie taps into that somehow.

I won't go on and on about it. I will however urge you to find time to see it if you have not done so already.

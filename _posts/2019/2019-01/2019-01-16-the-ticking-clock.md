My hosting plan at WordPress runs out in four months. Being completely truthful, I don't know if I'm going to carry on - or even if I want to carry on. I know I've wobbled quite a bit in recent months, and you're probably bored of reading about it, but I'm wondering if maybe it's time - time to take a break - to step away for a while.

I've been doing this since 2003 - writing almost every day about whatever has been on my mind. It's almost always been heavily filtered, and increasingly selective.

Over the years I've crossed paths with some wonderful people through the blog. Some of them are still writing, some stopped many years ago, and some are no longer with us. I think of them often.

On balance, my experience of blogging has been incredibly positive. I've never had to deal with trouble-makers, idiots, trolls, manipulators, or scam artists, but then I've never courted the controversy that might attract them.

Maybe it's time though. Time to step away for a while, and perhaps focus a little more on the little paper notebook nestled in the bottom of my bag. I've found myself writing in it a little more often just recently, and unexpectedly enjoying the freedom it affords.

Over the course of the last week we have begun decluttering around the house - digging out long forgotten things from the back of cupboards, and the attic - and putting them up for sale on E-Bay. Among the various items was an Apple iMac from the early 2000s. I'm not entirely sure of it's vintage - we bought it perhaps ten years ago on E-Bay from a school that had unearthed it from a long forgotten storage cupboard. It had almost certainly never been used.

For those interested in such things, it's a Bondi Blue G3, with 500Mb of memory, a PowerPC processor, and has OS 10.4 installed - "Tiger". I had a Macbook years ago - one of the pretty white ones - and always maintained that Tiger was the best version of OS X that Apple ever made - it had none of the bloat of the versions that followed it.

After selling all manner of other memories from the loft - among them a Nintendo, a Super Nintendo, a Sega Dreamcast, a number of Nintendo hand-helds, and a Sega Saturn, I couldn't quite bring myself to sell the Mac. There's just something about it - something I can't seem to let go of. It got me through NaNoWriMo late last year. Hell - it's even got an old version of Scrivener installed on it. I suppose there's an eccentric hope that it might entice me to write something worth reading one day.

I remember reading about George R R Martin using an old DOS computer running Wordstar - I wonder if the Mac might provide a similar function for me? While I might not end up writing anything of worth on it, there's something romantic about writing on an old Apple Mac - a feeling. It's hard to describe. I suppose in some ways it's a little like using an old mechanical typewriter - although a more modern digital equivalent.

If you're wondering how I will backup anything I write on it, you might be surprised to learn that it connects to the internet just fine - OSX was based on BSD Unix, and the internet pretty much runs on Linux - a close relative. I'm not using the internet though - oh no - I'm using an Iomega ZIP drive - another eBay acquisition. It turns out twenty year old ZIP disks work just fine - they make a reassuring clunk sound as you push them in, and mechanical whirring sounds as data is read or written - none of that silent USB memory stick nonsense.

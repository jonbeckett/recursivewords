We leave in a few hours, and won't be back until Monday afternoon. After posting so frequently to the blog for so long, it's going to feel strange storing the thoughts and memories away for a few days instead of posting them to the internet.

I just picked up a book from the shelf and threw it in my bag - "The Summer Book", by Tove Jansson. I've been meaning to read it for a LONG time, and being away from everything for a few days seems like the perfect opportunity.

We don't know if there will be a mobile signal on-site, let alone WiFi. When the children discovered there would be no television, there was a moment of silent shock - they seem to be acclimatising well though, sitting around the kitchen table at the moment with their noses in puzzle books.

It's finally the weekend. After ordering Domino's as a special treat, watching a ridiculous movie, and drinking a can of beer, I'm starting to switch off.

The project I have been working on for the last several months - that I have woken up thinking about, stood in the shower thinking about, and cycled to work thinking about - will be shown to the client on Monday. It's been a journey. My absence from the internet at large for the last several months is mostly down to the gargantuan effort to heave this project over the finishing line.

Of course it's only the first finishing line. There will be more - many more.

Anyway. I don't have much left in me to conjur words this evening - perhaps more might be forthcoming over the weekend. There are plans afoot to visit London with Miss 18 - plans involving trains, Doctor Martens boots, comic books, and sushi.

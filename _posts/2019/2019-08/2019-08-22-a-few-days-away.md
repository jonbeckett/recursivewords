Tomorrow morning we fill the car with bags, and head to the coast to spend a few days with my parents. I'm not entirely sure I'll be posting to the blog while away, so this might be the last words you see from me for the better part of a week.

We're not taking very much with us this time. It's funny really - when the children were small we would load the car up with enormous quantities of rubbish that would invariably go untouched throughout our stay. We seem to have boiled everything down to clothes, washbags, tablets, and phones - oh, and a few paperback books for the beach.

I do hope the weather is kind to us over the coming days.

It's already 1am. Time to get some sleep - we have a long journey ahead of us in the morning.

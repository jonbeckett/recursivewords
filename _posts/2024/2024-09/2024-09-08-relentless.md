To say the last few days, weeks, or months have been something of a grind would be something of an understatement. A relentless trudge between drama, arguments, and disasters where I instinctively throw myself under the bus to either resolve or support everybody else in whatever endeavour they are failing spectacularly at.

It wears you down. It really does.

Of course I can't write about any of it, because the stories are not mine to tell. I'm invariably the unseen hand that enters at the 11th hour - often with nobody realise I was there, or what I quietly did.

There's an old saying, isn't there - "you can keep some of the people happy all of the time, and all of the people happy some of the time". Never has it felt so true.

I just don't know if I can keep doing it, you know?

There comes a point when you have to start putting yourself ahead of others - if only occasionally. Invest in yourself - your own physical and mental health. Your own well-being.

Does this mean I'm going to start running again? Quite possibly.

I miss the head-space that running creates. The flood of endorphins. The highs and lows. Granted, I'm never going to be "a runner", and my body isn't always happy with me when running, but I enjoy it. As I've mentioned in the past - it also has the benefit of avoiding my backside growing to the size of Jupiter.

The only downer? Getting up an hour earlier to go for a run.

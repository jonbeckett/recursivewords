After being invited out for dinner on Friday night, I found myself caught between a rock and a hard place. While I love spending time with friends, I haven't spent much time with my children recently - and after my eldest daughter asked what I was doing that evening, it really wasn't a decision at all. As your kids get older, the times they want to spend time with you become increasingly rare.

We holed up on the couch and watched several episodes of "3 Body Problem" together - the western re-make of the Chinese series on Netflix - based on the books by Liu Cixin. The interesting thing about the TV series - the western version accomplishes in 8 episodes what the Chinese version takes 30 episodes to cover.

I'm still not sure what I thought of it. It feels like it could have done with twice as much budget to establish a little more wonder. I'm trying hard not to ruin the story for anybody that's not seen it. I've bought the books too - they're teetering atop the unread book mountain that might bury me at any moment.

The rest of the weekend has been remarkably quiet - mostly filled with chores, gardening, and internet rabbit holes. Sometimes quiet is good. Time to reflect. Time to recharge. I've filled the garden refuse bin to the top, and will have to wait for it to be emptied before hacking any more of the jungle back.

Anyway.

While writing this I'm waiting for a food delivery to arrive. We're being brave and trying out somewhere new (to us). The food is on it's way right now. Fingers crossed.

I should perhaps also share that I'm moving the blog back to Substack. I never seem to learn that the hosting operation at Wordpress is very much an afterthought, when compared to the development of the platform itself. It's not massively broken - but the parts of it that don't work as they should pull at you like a loose thread.

I guess herein lies a question (to those reading at Wordpress) - will you mind if I migrate your subscription to Substack for you, or would you rather subscribe to anything I might post at Substack yourself?

It's been a bit of a day. A bit of a week really. I'm at the start of a huge project at work, so wearing a succession of hats. Once the project starts rolling properly I'll have time to take stock - at the moment it all seems a bit manic - being pulled in several directions at once all the time.

I'm trying to think of some music to put on while writing this - but am coming up with nothing. I just asked Alexa to play some "late night music", and she's chosen Taylor Swift. It's pretty dark, slow, and relaxing - I have no idea what track it is.

The coming weekend is going to be interesting. Our youngest daughter turns 19. She has invited several friends for a sleepover - I think they're taking over the living room for Saturday afternoon and evening. I imagine the rest of us will scatter to the four corners of the house to escape them. I wonder if the internet connection will survive that many teens at once?

It's funny - normally I'm outnumbered four to one by women in the house - with the extra influx it's going to get pretty ridiculous. The older I get, and the more complicated their lives become, the more I find myself playing the part of the father in Dirty Dancing. Always here to pick them up, to console, and to give advice - but also on the receiving end of endless sarcasm.

Aha - I know the next track - it's "Anti-Hero". Go me. I could probably do a pub-quiz on Taylor Swift at this point. As long as they play "Anti-Hero".

Full disclosure - I bought a couple of her albums earlier in the year - part of the drive to add at least _some_ female singers to our vinyl record collection. She joined Madonna and Tori Amos in the rather exclusive collection of music I'm re-acquiring. Next on the list are Sara Bareilles, Idina Menzel, and P!nk.

It's getting late. I should probably go and collapse into bed. I have to make another trip into town in the morning for sleepover food supplies.

Perhaps I should hole-up at the pub tomorrow evening - invite a few friends and actively avoid instagram ground zero for a few hours. We'll see.

Well this is going well. I sat down to write something in the blog about going running after work today, and instead got sucked into watching some guitarist on YouTube that's recorded "shred" cover versions of all manner of famous tracks by other bands. Before I knew it, the better part of an hour had whistled passed, and Monday had become Tuesday.

So yes. I went for a run! I tried out the fit-bit for the first time, doing what it was invented for (although it seems most of their statistical analysis centres around sleep patterns - which is kind of interesting, but there's not much you can really do about "sleeping better").

So yes. I went running. And I didn't die. And I felt much better about myself afterwards.

I started out slow, and found myself thinking "is this too slow? too fast? how fast am I breathing? how long can I do this for?" - and then before I knew it my mind wandered off to thinking about this and that, and then I was passing two kilometres. Strava whispered the timings into my ear and I shook my head. How is it that no matter how I set out, I end up running each kilometre within seconds of the same time - every time. The more I try to slow down, the faster I get. It's like I have some sort of insanely accurate internal metronome.

We're going to the cinema tomorrow evening - which means no back-to-back days running. Maybe I'll just go for a walk at lunchtime. Stretch my legs. Clear my head. I often solve programming problems while out walking - then of course the struggle is to remember what I solved by the time I get back.

Back when I used to commute a lot, I would scribble down notes about characters I had seen along the way - things like "the worn down gentleman in the grew suit, reading the newspaper". It was just enough to recall them again later - to write about them. I need to start doing that again.

Now if you'll excuse me, it's far later than bedtime o'clock. I need all the good sleep - to please the damn fit-bit.

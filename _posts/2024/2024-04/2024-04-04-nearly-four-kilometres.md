I surprised myself this morning. After scraping myself out of bed I pulled on some running shorts and wandered downstairs. A few minutes later I was out in the morning air, setting off on a familiar route - deliberately slowly.

The first kilometre came up within seconds of my usual pace. Go figure. So did the next, and the next. I eventually chose to stop at nearly four kilometres. I suspect I could have continued on to five, but didn't want to tempt fate. It's been a while.

The temptation to stretch out to five kilometres at the weekend is huge. I need to remember to take it easy though. After not running for the better part of six months - with the occasional jog here and there - this was really just day three.

It is amazing though - how quickly your fitness comes back. I suspect shifting the padding around my middle might take a bit longer that a few days. Not eating pizza so often would be a good start.

ANYWAY.

That's all I really have "of note" today.

Oh. One more thing. I finally bought some new earbuds for running - the ones that hook over your ear, so you're not in continual fear of them falling out. I only ordered them this morning, and they turned up this evening. Amazing.

Now if you'll excuse me, it's half past my bedtime.

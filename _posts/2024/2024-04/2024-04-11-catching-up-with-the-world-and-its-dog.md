Today started so well. A lovely quiet morning clearing the decks before sitting down at my work computer to catch up on email. Oh. Why have they written to me? What's this about?

What followed was perhaps four hours of investigation, excavation, and detective work - following a breadcrumb trail this way and that across "the cloud" to understand why something that shouldn't have been happening was happening.

It comes to something when you have to construct the software equivalent of Arthur and the Incredibles "Seeing Stone" to even begin to make sense of the unfolding mayhem. Late in the day a t-shirt I saw some time ago came to mind, that described my day remarkably well - starting with "that shouldn't happen", and ending with "how did that ever work in the first place?".

Anyway. I try not to write about work.

Some new toys arrived this week - toys that will keep me out of trouble for some time. A Chromebook, and a Raspberry Pi. The Chromebook replaces the hulking Windows laptop I tried to tell myself was a good idea some time ago. The Pi will find itself transmogrified into a gaming machine in pretty short order - simulating all manner of 1980s and 90s coin-operated arcade machines. Sometimes the lure of a quick game of Pacman, Asteroids, Defender, or Donkey Kong is pervasive.

Tomorrow is Friday. Nearly the weekend. I wonder how much coffee I can chug through while racing to catch up with the world and it's dog?

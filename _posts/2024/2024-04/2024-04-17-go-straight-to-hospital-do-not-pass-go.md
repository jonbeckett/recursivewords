The night before last our youngest daughter started complaining that her back hurt. We didn't think much about it at the time - she always has some ailment, injury, ache or pain to complain about.

We were reminded at 4am the next morning when our eldest woke us, after being awoken by her sister calling out and crying in the night. After some paracetamol, ibuprofen, and a glass of water, Miss 19 returned to bed and we all tried to get back to sleep.

Our middle daughter - who works at the same café - did a double shift the next day to cover for her sister, while she slept throughout the day. She emerged at dinner time, and sat at the dining table with us - going downhill by the minute.

Eventually she sat on the sofa after dinner and began hyperventilating -  not quite knowing what to do with herself as another wave of pain overtook her. It's worth noting that she has the highest pain threshold of anybody in the family - another story for another day.

I looked at my other half, and we both knew what I was about to say next.

"I think we better call an ambulance".

For perhaps the second or third time in my life I called the emergency services, and very quickly handed the phone over to my other half instead of relaying questions and answers back and forth. 

Ten minutes later we were called back - asking if we could get to the hospital ourselves - it would be quicker than waiting for an ambulance. Half an hour later we arrived at the hospital, and jumped every queue - we had an advance booking in accident and emergency, done by the call handler.

Four hours later - yes, four hours later - we left accident and emergency to travel home. It didn't seem like four hours, but it had been. I won't go into too much detail, other than to say we visited the pharmacist first thing this morning to pick up prescriptions for antibiotics, and for painkillers strong enough to slow down a very angry elephant.

She has slept most of the day.

For the next few days we're keeping a close eye on her. Thankfully I work from home, so am here if she gets worse again. Fingers crossed.

Somehow we both returned to work today, and got through the day. I joked in the morning teams call that I might need match-sticks to keep my eyes open. Although I made it through the day more or less unscathed, I'm really starting to flag now.

Like I said. Fingers crossed.

In other news, while sitting in the hospital waiting area an old school friend messaged me - asking if I would be interested in meeting up - she's trying to put together a reunion of sorts. I've never been to a reunion. I wonder if they're fun, or a bit of a nightmare? I've not been back to the town where I grew up for over 25 years.

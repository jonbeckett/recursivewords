There is a term used in computer science called "bootstrapping" - describing the process by which a computer starts itself - essentially bringing itself to life by lifting itself into the air by it's own bootstraps. I did a pretty similar thing this morning.

After the better part of three weeks suffering with a never ending cold and cough I seem to be on the mend at last. This morning I dragged myself out of bed and went for a run.

I was quite shocked at how much fitness I have lost. The same body that easily ran five kilometres every morning last September is now struggling to make it through two or three. I'm seriously considering running every morning this month again - firstly to get the distance back up, but secondly to get the feeling back.

I remember after stopping running in October last year - having picked up an injury - I really missed it during the time I was recuperating. There's something about it - running - that establishes a base for the rest of your day. It clears your mind, and helps your mood enormously.

Two of my daughters have signed up with the local gym and are going once or twice a week - I'm thinking about doing the same, but would only be able to make it early in the morning - leaving the house at 6:30am, in order to get home, showered and changed ready for work. It's not impossible, but would then stop me from pursuing other interests in the evening, because I'll just be too tired.

Sometimes "finding time" means "choosing". I don't like choosing.

In other news, I'm back looking at note-taking apps again - trying to decide between Obsidian and Notion. Or retreating to the bullet journal again. I've been here before - it's a kind of madness.

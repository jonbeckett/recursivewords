It's been a week. A week filled with hospital visits, very little sleep, and endless juggling at work. The good? Our youngest daughter is on the mend. Slowly. The bad? We're all wandering around like zombies.

Somehow it's already approaching lunchtime on Sunday. The morning has passed in a blur of coffee, washing clothes, emptying and re-filling the dishwasher, and picking up after others. For the first few hours of the day I was the only person up - pottering here and there, getting this and that done. My other half has now appeared, and has formed a nest on the couch in her PJs. She does that.

I just realised the washing machine has finished. Back in a minute.

(ten minutes pass... because nothing in reality takes a minute)

So - in-between the endless rounds of mayhem this week, what else has been going on?

I bought myself a "fit-bit". I have now confirmed that yes, I don't get enough sleep. I've also confirmed that I walk about 10,000 steps most days even before I go running. I've not been running with it on yet - I half thought about it this morning. Maybe tomorrow. I would love to get back to running every other day again - or even every day - but something always seems to get in the way of that at the moment (mostly myself, I know). I guess half the reason this week has been not wanting to leave my youngest daughter on her own. Fingers crossed the week ahead will be better.

What else ?

After tinkering with bullet journals, Notion, and countless other mindfulness/note-taking hacks over the last couple of years, I finally signed up for the sync service with Obsidian. If you've never heard of it, Obsidian is kind of the deepest note-taking rabbit hole of the lot. On the surface, extremely simple - but under the surface kind of the "well of all souls" of the note-taking world. I fully expect to come face-to-face with the Goblin King within the mind-palace labyrinth I'm busy constructing.

There is method behind the madness. I've ended up with bits and pieces of notes about different things all over the place - in archived emails, in spreadsheets, in Google Keep, in Notion, and even in paper notebooks here and there. I need to stick to one thing - one place - one "trusted store". Thankfully Obsidian runs on everything (well... except my brain, I suppose) - my phone, tablet, Chromebook, laptop, desktop - even the Raspberry Pi.

Anyway.

While catching up with email last night, it occurred to me that I've not only fallen off the "social internet" recently, but "the real world" too. It's so easy to just focus on getting from one day to the next, to keep pedalling. Before you know it that's all you're thinking about - turning the pedals.

While busy pedalling you don't look where you're going, and end up veering away from everybody and everything you care about.

It turns out finding your way back is hard.

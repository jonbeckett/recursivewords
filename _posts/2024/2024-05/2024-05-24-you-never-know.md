I often wonder if we are leaves floating along a river - travelling together for a time, finding our way, sometimes drifting apart, sometimes returning, sometimes not - but always changed by the journey.

We go forwards. Life doesn't stand still. Time doesn't rewind. The machinery of the universe continues to turn and takes us with it on our journey.

Tennyson comes to mind:

It may be that the gulfs will wash us down:

It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,

And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.

Tho' much is taken, much abides; and tho'

We are not now that strength which in old days

Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are;

One equal temper of heroic hearts,

Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will

To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.

You never know what tomorrow might bring. You could be saying goodbye to an old friend for the last time, or introducing yourself to somebody  that will change your life forever.

You never know.a

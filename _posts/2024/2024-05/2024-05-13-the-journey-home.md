After two days of glorious sunshine, the tables were turned this morning. The heavens didn't so much open, as their entire contents fell on Cornwall.

We left for the station mid-morning, and began a puddle dodging drive - hitting every red light between Talland and Liskeard. We were dropped at the railway station with seconds to spare - running through the puddles and catching the eye of a guard at the back of the train who watched our approach. He held the train. We were the last aboard.

The next three hours were spent thankful that we found two available seats. To get to the sears we had to pick our way past hundreds of fellow travellers - apologising repeatedly as the train threw us in their direction.

I felt the frustration of a young mum trying to wrestle with her children and a stroller while also lifting bags while other passengers strode over her. I held back and afforded her a few seconds - she looked up with the best smile - soaked to the skin - and thanked me.

"I'm never travelling with young kind on my own ever again"

I smiled, and volunteered "been there" - nodding towards my travelling companion, who also smiled.

For most of the journey I watched "Fallout" - a TV series based on a video game that came out recently. I'm not a great watcher of television, but it somehow grabbed me. Before I knew it we were approaching Reading station, and a change of trains.

A little while later we departed Maidenhead station and met my other half - who timed her arrival to coincide with ours. On the way home the car was filled with stories of beaches, walks, lunches, amusement arcades, and Nan saying hilarious things she shouldn't have.

When we got home our middle daughter called on her way home from work - asking if her sister would like to go shopping. Before we knew it she had pulled on shoes, and was gone.

Although they never say it, and although they fight like cat and dog, I think our younger daughters miss each other quite a bit when they are apart. It's very odd, but also kind of nice.

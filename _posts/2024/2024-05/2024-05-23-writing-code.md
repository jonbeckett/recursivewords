I'm not really sure where the last few days have gone. Actually - that's not entirely true.

I've been submerged in a complex project at work - an all consuming project that has burned through most of my headspace from the moment I wake in the morning, to the time I fall into bed in the evenings. I find myself turning the abstract problems over in my head at the most unexpected times - while grocery shopping, while in the shower, while waiting for the kettle to boil...

Today was the worst day so far. I realised something wasn't working, and while coding a solution for it had a bit of a lightbulb moment - a "moment of clarity" - a "hack" - a leap of logic that gave me a way of getting a handle on an enormously complex problem.

Although I sometimes talk negatively about programming, there's really nothing like the moment when something complicated works - when your ingenuity, ideas, and inventiveness combine to make a pile of silicon and electricity do something unfeasibly complicated in the blink of an eye.

I tend to walk off for a celebratory cup of coffee following the little victories - and of course then think of something else, so run back with the coffee to continue on.

At the end of the last couple of days my entire body has felt tired, which is crazy given that I've been sitting at the desk all day. Earlier in the week I escaped for an hour at lunchtime to grab something to eat. I forced myself to walk a lap of town, and bought sushi from the supermarket along the way. My watch told me I was "earning" as I strode purposefully home to fill my face with food.

Anyway.

I should probably head to bed. More programming to be done in the morning. More to invent. More to build.

The weirdest thing about software and web development? That you're constructing something out of nothing. It's a bit like writing in that regard, I suppose - starting with a clean sheet of paper, and ending up with a story.

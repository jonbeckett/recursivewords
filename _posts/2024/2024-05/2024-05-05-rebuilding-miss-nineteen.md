Note to self - grammar check blog posts before they go out into the world - then at least there might be a chance that entirely missing words will be picked up - probably caused by offloading unstructured thoughts in the dead of night.

So.

Yesterday - Saturday - I scraped myself out of bed a little after 7am, had a shower, shave, got dressed, made a coffee while listening to Magic radio (a popular commercial station - our radio is not "magic"), then knocked on my youngest and eldest daughter's bedroom doors. I had suggested a day in London earlier in the week - part of "operation parachute our youngest the hell out of here".

Almost miraculously both girls arrived in the kitchen a few minutes later. I say miraculously because it can sometimes take atomic weapons to rouse our eldest. I think perhaps she knew her role for the day - "support sister", chaperone, and half-an-eye on the phone our youngest had back in her pocket for the first time in days.

While were were a little bit worried about our youngest giving into temptation and unblocking a certain somebody, we were more worried about he or his "ex" (never really his ex at all) creating yet more false identities in their abusive pursuit of her. Yes. That's all been happening. As with all master criminals, they don't realise the targets of their attacks - a circle of school friends - are sharing everything with their parents and each other.

Anyway.

Yesterday was all about distraction.

I looked at my newly acquired "fit-bit" late last night. 19,000 steps. 15 kilometres. 4,500 calories burned. Myself and my eldest were pretty broken by the time we got home. Our youngest was absolutely fine.

Our adventure in London took us to the Science Museum in Kensington to look *everything* (her idea - not mine - I know !?), to Hamleys in Regent Street for a visit to "The Bear Workshop", to Forbidden Planet to stock up on Manga, then on to M&M World to buy our body-weight in chocolate. It was all paid for by what we have begun calling "the pretend aeroplane money" - the proceeds of my YouTube channel. It has it's uses.

The Science Museum had a fascinating area exploring what it means to be human - with various interactive areas around genetics, intelligence, perception, and so on. I surprised the kids by being scarily good at making photo-fit pictures in one of the interactive displays. I didn't tell them that I did it by deconstructing faces in the same way you do while drawing them - measuring the gaps, and noticing the relationships of corners, creases, and folds.

It's always fascinating - visiting London. I can never quite wrap my head around the number of people travelling in all directions, all the time. Literally millions over the course of a day. Vast rivers of people - from all walks of life, all kinds of backgrounds, and probably from every corner of he world. While squashed into an underground train at one point in the day I noticed an elderly American couple in the middle of the train - apprehensively checking the route map, and looking around them. The carriage was filled with just about every race and ethnicity - I wondered if other cities around the world are as diverse, and what they thought of it.

I suppose I should go start clearing the kitchen up. We're heading out for a family lunch later. More distraction.

At the end of the week I'm taking our youngest to visit my parents on the coast for a few days. Parachuting her far away to one of her favourite places, to visit some of her favourite people. I'm hoping the distance and distraction will help a little with perspective, lower anxiety, and afford the opportunity to slow down - to take stock - to put herself back together. I imagine there will be lots of walking, beach combing, eating of ice-cream, drinking of hot-chocolate, and talking about anything and everything.

Fingers crossed.

Today's writing prompt at Wordpress asks "what experiences in life helped you grow the most?". Good question - and one I might answer differently on any given day. Don't you just love cold-reading.

Grow in what way? Emotionally? Physically? Spiritually?

Books, movies, music, places, and people. Those are things that are tangled together into the experiences that have shaped me. Moments in time reading books that capture imagination, movies that provide escape, music wound into memories, and people. People most of all. Friends that have accompanied me, supported me, walked with me, and inspired me.

What am I saying?

Moments. The junctures in my life where direction changed, or where the path taken has forged memories to be carried throughout my life have all been woven around people. While books, movies and music tell stories, people are the story.

I've always found people endlessly fascinating. That we sometimes connect with each other for even the most fleeting moments reinforces that in a world filled with uncertainty, good still happens.

Several months ago, after a particularly difficult few weeks at work and home, my other half asked if I might book a few days away somewhere - just the two of us. A break. It didn't have to be anywhere spectacular - just away from here.

I opened Google Maps, scrolled around the British Isles, and essentially threw a dart at the map - towards an area we have never visited.

On Saturday morning we're setting off for Anglesey - an island on the north west coast of Wales. We're staying in a converted farm cottage on "Holy Island" - a futher small island separated somewhat from the main island of Anglesey.

We're taking books, some basic food, clothes for all weathers, walking boots, and not much else. There's a lovely pub within walking distance of the cottage, and miles of coast paths, forests and hills to explore.

I'm kind of looking forward to not thinking about much at all for a few days.

It won't be a total digital detox - the cottage has wifi, and we'll take at least one laptop with us. I imagine most evenings will be spent playing board games, sipping drinks, reading books, and perhaps polluting the internet with photos and words describing our adventures.

One more day.

One more day of programming, meetings, washing up, folding clothes, tidying up, and whatever else.

One more day.

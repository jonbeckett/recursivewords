The clock is racing towards midnight, and before long my week off will be no more.

I'm sitting in the dark of the junk room after a day spent gardening, tiding up, and washing clothes - listening to a long forgotten playlist on Spotify, and recalling moments from the past that only music can transport you to.

I curated the playlist while working in Frankfurt. It was a lonely existence - walking the city streets in the late evenings and early mornings with my eyes wide open, and music filling my ears. A friend on the other side of the world had a lot to do with the selections - debating bands, artists and songs endlessly with me - volunteering "oh, remember this?" and "you MUST add that!".

I remember one night in particular - lost in the crowds of the Christmas market of downtown Frankfurt - surrounded by happy families - children, parents, couples - and feeling tremendously lonely. I pushed some earbuds into my ears, started the playlist, and found myself.

Whenever I hear anything from that playlist now, I'm back there again - sipping hot chocolate, eating stroopwafels, and wandering through the crowds in the old town square.

Spandau Ballet started playing a few moments ago. A fork in the musical road of memories - taking me to a "Rewind" festival perhaps 12 years ago. Tony Hadley closed the show, and I ran to the front of the crowd hand-in-hand with my eldest daughter. She couldn't see because of the crush of people around us, so I lifted her on to my shoulders just in time to listen to the opening bars of "Through the Barricades".

There's something about being there in a crowd. The energy, the good will, and the feel of the music. It was a proper "core memory" moment.

Music unlocks so many memories.

I remember getting home from college and discovering my Dad had bought satellite television. I switched the TV on and went straight to MTV. The Pet Shop Boys were playing - I can remember it as if it was yesterday.

I remember walking around Borders in California with my cousin in the early 1990s, and picking up a record by a singer we had seen on the huge bank of televisions behind the bar we had lunch in that day - she was crossing over from Country to Pop and was everywhere. Her name was Shania Twain.

I remember walking from the aircraft to the terminal at Dallas airport when we visited my Uncle in the early 1980s. There was a giant poster on the side of a sky-scraper in down-town Dallas advertising a John Denver concert. Throughout our stay, his music was everywhere.

I remember the house I grew up in - where we lived until I was five years old - right on the limit of my memories (they say you only start to record memories you can recall from five onwards). Inside the back door was a fridge, and on that fridge stood a radio. I remember my Dad coming home from work one lunchtime, and "Mull of Kintyre" playing on the radio.

It's amazing, isn't it - how music can both transport us, and anchor memories. Not just scenes - also the emotions of the moment. The feelings. It's all very strange, but also quite wonderful.

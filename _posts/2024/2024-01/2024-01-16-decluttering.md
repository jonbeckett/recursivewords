I've given up trying to take part in "Bloganuary" every day. Life happens. Mayhem happens. What was it Obama said to the woke keyboard crusaders? Life is complicated and messy. Sometimes just getting to tomorrow is an achievement - regardless of the ideals, goals or aims we might strive to meet or achieve.

So. Today's prompt asks where we might remove clutter from our life.

Well. Where to start. If the rest of my family were not here, a LOT of clutter would be gone - pretty much instantaneously. Our dishwasher is broken at the moment. Last weekend I started counting - I washed seven kitchen-sinks full of plates, bowls, mugs, saucepans and cutlery during one day. Seven. Can you even believe that? Every time I walked back into the kitchen the sink had re-filled like some sort of Harry Potter horcrux charm was being triggered.

I spend much of my waking life in the "junk room" - the spare room that didn't get turned into a bedroom as the children grew up. Quite often it remains the tidiest room in the house - because I spend so much time in it. I work here. I write here. I record content for YouTube here. I sometimes watch movies here. I've been contemplating buying a comfy armchair to read books in here too. It's often the quietest room in the house.

You know the funny thing though? The clutter throughout the house is kind of what makes it a home. Every room tells a story filled with countless memories. Every shelf, every cupboard, and every drawer is filled with stories still being written, or waiting to be told.

Our house isn't so much cluttered - as filled with stories. Stories we're still writing - and sometimes those stories are complicated, and messy.

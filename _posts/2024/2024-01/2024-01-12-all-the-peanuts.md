Today's prompt asks "what snack would you eat right now?" - which I think might just set the low bar so far in terms of the writing prompts fed from Wordpress's cavernous bowels (now there's something to imagine). Seriously - who comes up with the writing prompts? What happened to the big questions about life, the universe, and everything?

I finished work late the other evening - as did my other half. She walked in the front door while I was still clearing the kitchen up. Don't even get me started about the kitchen, and our children's capacity to generate washing up. Yes, I know, I should force them to do it - but life is too short. I think I might literally die before they stop saying "in a minute", or coming up with bullshit excuses about how they have so many other things going on.

Anywhere. Where was I?

Oh yes - my other half got in, started ranting about cooking, so I threw myself under the bus and offered to walk into town and get something from the supermarket for everybody. I plugged some earbuds into my ears, put a podcast on, pulled on my warm coat, and set out into the night on my own for half an hour in pursuit of food. It was kind of wonderful - just me, and the podcast. No need to think, fight, argue, or whatever else.

Anyway.

While wandering around the supermarket - and oh my word was it busy - I picked up a gigantic packet of dry-roasted peanuts, and forgot all about them until this evening. While washing up, and clearing the kitchen again, I re-discovered them, and poured some into a small wooden bowl - dipping into them every time I walked past.

After some time I wandered into the lounge carrying the wooden bowl - still half-full - and gave it to my other half.

"Take these away from me before I eat them all"

"No - because I'll eat them all!"

"Yes - and that means I won't be able to"

She complained, but still took them.

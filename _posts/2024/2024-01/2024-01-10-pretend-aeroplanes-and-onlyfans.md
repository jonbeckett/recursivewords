Today's Bloganuary writing prompt challenges those taking part to "come up with a crazy business idea". 

Full disclosure - I shared the challenge with a good friend earlier, and wrote "well it's either flying pretend aeroplanes" (which I already do), " or Onlyfans". 

I'm not even joking. 

Onlyfans has become a running joke. When any of us need money for something, where we might have once commented about selling body parts on the columbian black-market, we now joke about starting an Onlyfans channel on the internet - which I suppose is still selling body parts in a way. 

Anyway! 

I really am working on a crazy business idea late almost every evening. I fly pretend aeroplanes around the world in a flight simulator, share my escapades on YouTube, and the community of people also tinkering with the simulator watch my idiocy. You might think that would struggle to find an audience - and you would be wrong. 

Somehow I've ended up with nearly twenty five thousand subscribers and literally millions of views. People keep calling me a "YouTuber", and a "content creator". It feels very odd. Uncomfortable even. 

I'm just a colossal nerd, geeking out with a hobby, and have discovered an unlikely audience - who provide all the encouragement I really didn't need (as my family will attest to). 

You know the weirdest thing? I keep getting compliments about everything from my teaching skills, to my pretend aeroplane piloting skills, and even my voice. Just yesterday somebody commented that I should contact the BBC and make a fortune narrating TV shows. 

So there you go. I don't need to come up with a crazy business idea - I already discovered it - quite by accident.

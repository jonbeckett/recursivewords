Today's "Bloganuary" writing prompt asks "what is the greatest gift anybody could give you".

That's a really tough question - because I don't really need anything. I suppose I could be clever and say something like "confidence", or "courage", but they seem too abstract.

Friendship.

That's the one thing that anybody can give, that costs nothing, has no monetary value, but probably outweighs everything else.

You can have all the things in the world, but if you have nobody to share them with, then what's the point?

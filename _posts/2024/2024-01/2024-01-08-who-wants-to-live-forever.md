Today's Bloganuary prompt asks "What are your thoughts on the concept of living a very long life?". Quite apart from objecting to the wording of the question (surely it's "the prospect", rather than "the concept"?), I'm not sure I've really thought about it before.

If you could live to a great age, would you want to?

I read an interview with the actor Michael Caine recently, where he credited his grandchildren with his continual drive to remain fit, healthy, and to keep abreast of the things they are interested in. He admitted to a fear of missing out - not of the things his grandchildren were doing - but the opportunity to be there - to see them grow - to find out where their stories lead.

I think I might be the same way. If a long life affords the opportunity to see where life takes those I love, that's pretty persuasive.

Of course a long life wouldn't come without strings. Ill health, lack of mobility, and mental impairment come with the territory. We're not built to last forever.

I suppose I can take some comfort in a relatively healthy lifestyle so far - I don't smoke, don't drink much, and have never taken recreational drugs. I eat a fairly healthy diet and keep fairly fit. I do wonder though - if this falls into the same "taking chances" bucket that has cropped up repeatedly in recent posts.

Would it be better to live a long, quiet life, or a shorter storied life?

Ernest Hemingway comes to mind - who somehow managed to live several lives worth of adventures within his own. Was he foolhardy, or lucky to survive to any sort of age? I guess we never know unless we find out for ourselves.

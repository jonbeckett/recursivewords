Today's Bloganuary writing prompt asks "what is your mission?". Sometimes it feels like my mission is no more than making it through the day unscathed. There are times where the mission is more about avoiding the arrival of tomorrow for as long as possible.

I'm not really a "mission" person. The rest of my family are. I spend much of my time either clearing up after them, or catching them when things go wrong - standing them back up - dusting them down - making sure they're good to go again.

This week my other half is talking about us going away at the end of March - a long weekend city break somewhere in Europe. My first reaction? Where is the money going to come from? Of course I didn't say that out loud.

Maybe my mission is avoiding conflict. I might think you're an ass-hat, but you'll never know it.

You know the strangest thing about listening to others rather than volunteering opinions? People tell you their inner-most thoughts. I've lost count of the times friends have confided in me.

An unexpected keeper of secrets.

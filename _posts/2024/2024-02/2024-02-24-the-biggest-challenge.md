Today's writing prompt asks "what is the biggest challenge you will face in the next six months". Here's where I step back, take a breath, think through if I want to write about this on the blog, and step forwards again.

There's a project at work - that will easily chew through the next six months - that hasn't started yet. It may start any day. I'm genuinely intimidated by it - mostly because it's a huge undertaking. It's going to be enormously complex, and attempt functionality nobody in a similar realm has tried before. Apologies if I'm being vague - but it's work - and I don't typically talk about work.

I think when any project is sufficiently complex, and sufficiently large, it tends to become intimidating - so you break it down. You chunk it up into pieces that aren't so scary, and work through the "must haves", "should haves" and "could haves" one at a time.

It's going to keep me busy, that's for sure.

While the project is going on I'll need to try harder than ever to switch off at the end of each day - to "do something else". The blog posts may slow down. Thankfully spring and summer will soon be upon us, so running, walking, and visits to the park for a coffee will be on the list of escapes.

It's hard. When you're interested in computers, the internet, problem solving, inventing things, building things... it's hard to stop. It's hard to slow down.

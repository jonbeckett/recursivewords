I logged into Wordpress at lunchtime, expecting a writing prompt to appear - only it didn't, because it's not January any more. That didn't stop a piece of the interface from sitting there and not populating with content though - because obviously Automattic suffer from the same problems every other organisation in the world does - one hand not having a clue what the other is doing.

So. I'm back to emptying my head about me, my life and everything, rather than being nudged by a daily question or topic.

What HAS been going on throughout January?

Not a lot, if I'm honest. Getting from one day to the rest, while doing a LOT of washing dishes, washing clothes, drying clothes, picking up after people, and generally being in a bad mood while the cats watch me walk this way and that doing this and that - all while I would be doing other things if I could.

Did I mention I work full time as well?

I've been RUBBISH at keeping in touch with friends during January. All I can do is apologise. (writes on non-existent sticky note "must try harder").

That's a good point actually - I need to buy some sticky notes. Have you seen how much the "official" ones cost?! It made me wonder - you know you occasionally see "pranks" where somebody's entire car has been covered in sticky-notes? The cost of those sticky-notes is probably more than the car is worth.

In other news, I started running again. This week. There were signs my backside was attaining Jupiter sized proportions again. Rather than knock the Earth off it's orbit, I thought it best I do something about it. Being half serious, I'm not getting any younger, and would rather be something-like fit, than struggle to get up and down the stairs.

We won't talk about the noises my knees make when I crouch.

I should get on with some work. I stopped for ten minutes to write this while downing a coffee. Before I know it the weekend will be upon us - and next week is filled to the rafters with work, travel, and more work. Fun times.

On reflection, this wasn't so much a head emptying post as an explosion of forgettable nonsense. Oh dear.

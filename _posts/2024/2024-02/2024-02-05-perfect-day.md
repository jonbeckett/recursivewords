Today's writing prompt asks us to describe an ideal day, from beginning to end.

I would get up and discover the bathroom mat hasn't been left on the floor after the last person had a shower. I would also find no pile of dirty clothes hidden behind the bathroom door, and the empty toilet roll tube replaced with a fresh roll of paper.

In the kitchen there would be no washing up either stacked on the work-top, or dumped in the sink - and any recycling would have found it's way to the bin, rather than being stacked next to the sink.

In the lounge I would find no half-full cups of tea from the night before, empty wrappers, or junk mail and letters hidden in piles behind the coffee table.

I would find no wet washing in the washing machine, and discover that my children had picked up yesterday's dry clothes and put them away - perhaps even in their wardrobes, rather than on their bedroom floors.

A few close friends would reach out to me during the day - not because they want something - but because they want to share some of their time with me. A message or two. An email. A comment on a recent blog post. It could be as short as a few words, or a long rambling story everything and nothing at all.

After work I would make spaghetti bolognese for everybody, and wash up as I go - leaving no mountain of washing up to face afterwards. I would hope the rest of my family might catch on to that "trick" eventually.

While cooking I would play my records on the record player - filling the house with my music, and nobody would complain about it.

After dinner I might watch a movie - and not face complaints about it being a terrible movie, or how the loud bits were "too loud", or the quiet bits "too quiet".

Finally I would fall into a bed which wasn't covered with washing, boxes of who-knows-what, or whatever else, and read a good book until I fell asleep.

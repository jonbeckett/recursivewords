Four years ago - during one of the periods of isolation in the depths of the pandemic - I recorded a podcast talking to family, friends, writers, and bloggers about life, the universe and everything. Ever since, the podcast has sat almost forgotten in a dusty corner of the Spotify, Apple, and Google servers.

I thought it might be time to dust down the old episodes and make them available for new ears. While the episodes with family members provide a time capsule of sorts - transporting us back to life during the pandemic - the episodes talking to writers and bloggers are perhaps timeless.

During the run of the podcast I arm-twisted a number of old friends into taking part - exploring the origins of their writing journey - how they got started, where they write, and what they write about.

The podcast was never more than a hobby project, and perhaps grew in it's short run into something more produced and curated than I might have liked, but it was fun to create.

Who knows - perhaps one day I'll record another episode - and then another. We know how that story goes.

If you click the "[Podcast](https://jonathanwrotethis.substack.com/podcast)" link at the top of my blog, you can find all the old episodes.

Friday night. Listening to Kate Bush, accompanied by a glass of wine, eating secret cookies that were hidden in the book-case. I forgot all about the cookies - they've been there for weeks.

It's finally the weekend.

Tomorrow will be filled with a trip to the pub in the morning for breakfast with my other half and one of my daughters. After that they're off to IKEA - I have no idea why, but it will probably result in my services being required with a drill, screwdrivers, and whatever else a few hours later - just like last weekend.

Alanis Morrissette is now filling the room with all manner of wonderfulness. Is that a real word? I've always adored her. She has always been her own person - unwilling to bend.

On Sunday my in-laws are arriving for a meal. In the morning there's a charity run through town - the "Santa Fun Run" - several hundred people dressed as Father Christmas, running a 5K route around town. All of us have taken part at one time or another over the years - I think this might be the first year in a decade where at least one of us isn't running. It feels strange.

Hands Clean. That's what the song Alanis is singing is called. Kate was singing "The Man with a Child in his Eyes". Sara Bareilles is singing "Love Song" now - from Waitress. I remember seeing the posters for it in London a few weeks before the Pandemic arrived - I sometimes wonder just how huge of a star she would have been.

(a few minutes pass while I get completely lost in the music)

Idina Menzel has started singing "Extraordinary" now. I remember staying up late one night while my other half was out, and watching a performance of "Chess" at the Albert Hall in London. I didn't know who she was, but of course found out later. I blame her for becoming a huge fan of "Rent".

It's funny, isn't it - I've spent the last few months buried in programming during the day, or pretend aeroplane content creation during the evenings - and haven't so much as put a single record on the turntable in the lounge. Actually - that's a lie. I did put Alanis on a few weeks ago. My other half got home and asked me to turn the volume down. Literally the first words out of her mouth.

Oh.

I know what's going on now. It's a playlist I made ages ago. Shania has now arrived, and is singing about still being "the one".

Coffee. I might need a coffee. You'll have to imagine me humming in the kitchen in a minute.

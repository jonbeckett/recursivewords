I'm back at work today after a week at home - a "staycation". Of course I work from home, so I'm not really "back" - I'm still here - where I was, where I am, where I will be.

I will admit to a certain amount of dread this morning. It abated after several in-box zero inspired sweeps of email and messages - or mass deletions, as they might more accurately be described.

Today is a "development day" - the first I can ever recall having on my calendar. You're supposed to use them to clean house - to get ahead of the game if you can. I've been busy sorting out notes - recording and curating the things I've been doing for the last several months.

I've been tinkering with bullet journals, filofaxes, and various digital note taking solutions for ages, and am still no closer to figuring out the best way of doing anything. While I love stationery - pens and paper - I can also see the benefits of the various digital solutions too.

The original text of these blog posts is a good example. I have backups of pretty much everything I've ever written in Google Docs, OneDrive, Dropbox, Github and Notion - for no reason other than "because I can". Every now and again I wander from one repository to the next, bringing them in-line with each other. It's utter madness.

Alongside the rabbit-hold storage labyrinth, I also change my mind about which writing app or environment I like best too. I've written on desktops, laptops, in text editors, in specialist writing apps (the mighty Scrivener has been wheeled out from time to time), and in all manner of retro word processors that have only existed within virtual environments for the last thirty years.

There's an appeal to taking the George R R Martin route - to run an old computer where there are no opportunities to tinker. No distractions.

I wonder how long until I buy my first typewriter?

Let's keep a long story very short. The new version of the pretend aeroplane game that I make pocket-money out of arrived a week ago (I like calling it a "pretend aeroplane game", because it annoys the "simulator" crowd). That's why I've not written anything for a few days. It's also why I've hardly slept - burning the candle at both ends to create content, and find my way around the "new world".

Some interesting conversations have arisen in recent days as people faced the same vertical learning curve - most of them quite predictable. I've been asked why everything has changed, why did it need to change, how do you make it work like it used to, and more.

I'm starting to figure out that I'm not put together like most people. Rather than get frustrated, annoyed, and spend endless hours complaining to anybody that might take my side, I took a step back, figured "this is all new", and started over.

I will admit more to intimidation than frustration. The first steps into anything new are always tinged with fear, uncertainty and doubt.

Within 48 hours I had learned how the new world worked - and consigned the old world to the past. I threw all of my energy into where we're going, rather than where we came from.

I don't understand people that continually look back - that wish their life away trying to re-create the world as it once was. Yes, change can be frustrating but it's also filled with opportunity, new experiences, and unwritten stories.

I guess some people sort of enjoy wallowing in the fear and doubt - actively spreading it as far and wide as they can - perhaps so they're not alone? Who knows.

Anyway.

That's what I've been doing since I last wrote.

I'm sure I'll return to the real world soon. There's only so many 2am finishes you can get away with before your body says "no more candle burning, mister".

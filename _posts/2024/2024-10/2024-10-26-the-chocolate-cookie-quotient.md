After days filled with adventure and exploration last weekend, the return to reality this week has been somewhat jarring. I've been head-down for much of the week on a complicated work project - a "moon shot" of sorts.

I've been working through lunches, accidentally working late, going to bed thinking about the numerous problems to solve, and waking up with lines of programming running through my head. Probably not the best place to be.

I've been pretty distant from everybody and everything while buried in the project. Hopefully the coming week will reduce the burden somewhat - most of the most complex challenges are solved.

I showed a co-worker my progress this afternoon and received the best unsolicited compliment in ages in-between jokes about the number of packets of chocolate cookies a successful project takes to heft it from one milestone to the next.

"You know... what you've done here is kind of genius".

I grinned, made a self-deprecating comment, and admitted that many packets of chocolate cookies had given their lives to reach this point.

I wonder if there's a formula somewhere? A paper describing the relationship between chocolate, stress, caffeine, to-do lists, and project managers?

Anyway.

I'm hoping to escape for breakfast in the morning. A wander into town. I ran the idea past my better half a little earlier this evening, and received a noncommittal shrug.

Right now - late on Friday night - you find me sitting in bed with the Chromebook - tapping away on the keyboard in the dead of night while the sounds of some detective drama or other occasionally find their way through the floorboards. Two of the children are "out out". Of course I call them children - they're really not any more.

I have a half-read book on the Kindle - perched on the bedside table. The first of a series of books. Maybe I'll read that for a bit.

Maybe the weekend will bring a little life with it. Something worth writing about. Something worth reading. We'll see.

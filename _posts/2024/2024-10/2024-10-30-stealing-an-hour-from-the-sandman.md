The clock ticked past midnight nearly three quarters of an hour ago, and now races me towards sleep as I endeavour to complete one more thing - writing this post - before sleep inevitably wins.

I've been here before. I'll be here again.

I had a huge headache late this afternoon, and succumbed to paracetamol and some kind of magic "headache stick" that my other half magicked from wherever it is she keeps such things. I told myself it was a placebo until it worked - or the paracetamol worked - it's difficult to know which.

My world has been somewhat stressful over the last few days. Not through stress placed upon me by others - more through my own invention. I'm working on a software development project - something that might not have been possible - except of course it's me working on it - so of course it's possible. Anything's possible.

I do wonder sometimes though - I wonder how many times you can go back to the well - how much you have left in you, when it comes to tasks requiring such levels of mental gymnastics.

I did art at college. I was quite good at drawing - particularly people - and somebody asked me years later why I stopped. I replied that drawing people is a bit like doing mathematics. The level of concentration required - the accuracy - the observation - the care - the attention - is very similar. Over the course of several hours it takes it out of you. Programming is much the same.

Sometimes I get to the end of a day, and wonder if there might be an easier path. While my work is never boring, there's often a mixture of fear and expectation tied to it. I somehow always manage to drag projects over the finishing line - or out of the fire. It often feels like a streak waiting to be broken.

Anyway. There it is.

I suppose it's time to give in to the Sandman, and see what dreams he has in store for me tonight.

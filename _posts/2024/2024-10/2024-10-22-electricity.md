Exciting times arrived in the hereabouts this morning when a workman smashed and bashed his way around the front of our house. The workman was installing an electric car charging station - hopefully bringing the days of strategically planned trips to car-parks and service-stations to a close.

While the very busy man drilled holes, wired things up, and did whatever needed doing, there was a distinct lack of electricity - I imagine to avoid any unplanned light-shows or dance performances.

While waiting for the electricity to return I holed myself up in the junk room and half-wrote this blog post.

I'm not very good at doing nothing - although you might say I'm also not very good at doing what I should be doing either. I've never forgotten Mickey Flanagan's stage routine - his pro-tip about buying a cheap kettle because it takes longer to boil and you get to stand there waiting for it for a little longer.

The electricity returned a little after lunch.

The printer in the corner of the room slowly recovered from it's near death experience - clunking and whirring as it cleaned it's print heads and tried to call home - no doubt an attempt to order ink cartridges it doesn't need.

The wifi took some time to return, and induced panic among all of us.

I find that when the internet connection is removed for any longer than a few moments, teenagers tend to appear from the darkest, smelliest corners of the house. After switching several things off and on again - more in blind hope than anything - the internet made it's presence known, and the teenagers made contented noises and sidled off whence they came.

The rest of the day has been far less exciting.

Head down, programming, cursing, headbutting the desk, and then occasionally wandering into the kitchen for a celebratory cup of coffee. Small victories at the pixel mines are always celebrated with coffee. And a biscuit, if the kids haven't found them.

I can't tell you what I'm working on - which is a shame, because I could really bore a lot of people to tears talking about it.

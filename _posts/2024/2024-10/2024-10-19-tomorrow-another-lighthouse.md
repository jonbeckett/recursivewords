Yesterday marked our first full day in Brixham, and a concerted effort to not run here, there and everywhere - to not chase our own tail.

After much indecision mid-morning we found ourselves in a delightful French restaurant serving breakfasts - "La Petite Maison". Following the whole "when in Rome" trope, I ordered french bread with bacon and syrup. The number of calories in it probably required scientific notation, and my body probably still hasn't forgiven me, but oh my word was it delicious.

After breakfast we wandered around the many shops along the sea-front - deciding that we needed a new teapot, new mugs, new plates, and a hundred other things (we don't, but in the moment they all seemed like such good ideas).

Given the weather not following the rule book at all - blasting us with sunshine and a stiff breeze - we took the opportunity to walk out towards the harbour lighthouse - at the end of the breakwater.

Brixham has a colossal breakwater surrounding the harbour and marina - and an equally sizeable slipway. Along the way we discovered why. The US soldiers - the 4th Infantry Division - that set out for Utah beach during Operation Overlord in the second world war left from Brixham. The slipway and breakwater are now protected by Grade 2 listing - ensuring that generations to come will be able to visit, to learn, and to hopefully never to see the like again.

While wandering back the weather turned, and risked pelting us with most of the surrounding ocean. We retreated to a sea-front eaterie and ate our own body-weight in food we really didn't need before retreating to the cottage with a jigsaw and a book.

Today we're heading out along the coast in walking boots to visit the Berry Head peninsula. Not the longest walk, but hopefully lots of fresh sea air. The sky is mercifully clear - wish us luck.

Given unanticipated "home alone" status this morning I took it upon myself to wander into town and get some fresh air. Perhaps grab some breakfast at the pub, have a look in the bookshop, wander through the park and take pictures of the autumn leaves... just "be" - something I very rarely do.

I didn't make it to the pub or the bookshop, but I did make it to the park - and a secret garden along the way.

On the way through the back-streets there is an old house - it would have been quite the town house a hundred years ago, with an impressively long garden. Somewhere along the way the house became a business premises, and the garden a quiet secluded escape for those that find it.

I wandered around the garden for a few moments and wished I had brought a book. There are benches hidden in the sides of the garden - quiet corners - perfect to retreat from the world.

For at least a few minutes the world didn't seem as bad as others might have you believe.

I was reminded that the world is actually far worse than people have you believe about 300 yards further on. While waiting to cross the road into the park near the river an endless stream of non-player-characters spawned - arriving from all directions to prevent me crossing the road. After standing for a few moments I started counting the cars, while wondering how invisible I really am. I got to 27 when an old man waiting opposite me threw caution to the wind and stepped into the road. He was nearly hit. In the ensuing commotion I took my chance and snuck between two cars that were now impatiently waiting for the few seconds delay to their very important journeys to be removed.

The park was filled with children on tiny bicycles attempting to to run people down, and small dogs dragging their owners towards attempted fights with bigger dogs. What is it about small dogs having a Joe Pesci complex?

After trying to take a few pictures of the autumn trees without looking too much like a creep stalking families I wandered up the high street towards the book-shop and encountered the non-player-character invisibility issue once more. A hitherto quiet road became the busiest thoroughfare in town on my approach - with car after car bundling around a blind corner towards me, preventing me from crossing the road. After perhaps the sixth car appeared I shook my head and started walking up the road - past the first few queueing cars - catching the eye of the driver who actually looked apologetic (as they edged forward, preventing me from crossing).

I seriously started to consider my invisibility as I made my way back towards home - giving up on the pub and the bookshop - and almost smiled at my own ridiculousness. Of course I wasn't invisible.

And that's when somebody walked around a corner, straight into me.

"I'M SO SORRY! I DIDN'T SEE YOU!"

So there you go. They confirmed it. I really am invisible. You know how I left "do not disturb" on, in my mobile phone yesterday? I wonder if it's affected "the simulation"? Or the "Truman Show" I appear to play a starring role in? Perhaps the actors haven't been told to recognise my presence again yet.

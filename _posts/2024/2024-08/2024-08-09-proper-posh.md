While messaging back and forth with a good friend this morning I opined that I used to write in the blog almost every day -- and that somewhere along the line I fell off the blogging bicycle. Life happened. It's interesting how life tends to do that -- you look away for a moment and it fills the gaps.

The thing about putting one foot in front of the other is you invariably end up where other people want you to go, rather than where you might have liked to go.

So. I'm writing this. At lunchtime. I'm actually taking a lunch break for the first time in days.

Of course in-between writing these few paragraphs I've also made a cup of coffee, loaded the washing machine, cleared up the kitchen, and a few other things -- but the intention was there at least -- to do what I wanted, rather than what everybody else expected. I'm still writing this, after all.

We went "out out" last night -- to do the pub quiz in town with some friends. We ended up scraping our way into about fourth or fifth place I think -- not bad considering how many teams do the quiz. We've won it in the past -- more by luck than judgement. I was a passenger after the second pint of cider -- I really am rubbish at drinking these days.

I'm still grinning about the answer we didn't write to one of the questions in the quiz. The conversation went something like this:

Quiz master: "What do teenagers spend less than 35 minutes a week doing to relax?"

Friend: "Masturbate?"

Me: "I was going to say Masturbate too, but chickened out!"

(friend immediately breaks into a wonky grin at me)

Friend: "How did you say that?"

Me: "Masturbate?"

Friend: "Maaaaaaasterbate!" (prouncing the "Ma" as one might "Baaa" (as in sheep)). She then repeated it several times, trying it out.

Me: "I don't get it?"

Friend: "You're proper posh!"

I smiled, questioningly...

Friend: "Proper posh wanker!"

Of course by then I had drunk enough that everything was brilliantly funny, and everybody was wonderfully lovely. I'm kind of like that. I had a suitable headache this morning to show for it too. Still grinning though.

If you're interested in the real answer, it was of course that teenagers are only likely to watch half an hour of broadcast television during an average week any more. I doesn't surprise me at all.

Anyway.

Lunchtime is over. I should really get on with some work.

My other half spent all afternoon and evening sorting through bank statements and downloads of transactions to prepare my tax return for next year. Once upon a time she was a chartered accountant, so is faster with numbers than my brain can really cope with.

I'm a pretty simple creature at the best of times.

The upshot of her quite miraculous number-crunching? I'll owe a gargantuan amount to the authorities next April. I owed quite a lot this April, and paid it. Every penny I've earned through the flying of pretend aeroplanes has been accounted for -- all the incomings -- all the outgoings.

I suppose it's funny really. When the shackles of government changed hands in the UK a couple of weeks ago I cheered the result -- I've always thought that those that can help should -- with perhaps some smallprint to invalidate those that are unwilling to help themselves.

I suppose I never really considered that burning the candle at both ends -- effectively working two jobs -- would also double the tax burden. It's probably not a lot for some people, but it's eye-watering for me.

That crazy thing? I'm more worried about paying the right amount, than avoiding paying it. Being "Dudley Do Right" isn't fun sometimes.

I've always been this way. I've always tried to follow the rules. I sometimes see others exploiting the game at the expense of others, and wonder how they live with themselves.

Along the way I've attracted the attention of those that prey on others. Just recently I've begun receiving all manner of marketing offers -- from those wishing to take advantage of "my" audience (which feels very strange to write down). It feels very strange -- seeing through the wonderfully worded introductory approaches -- quickly ascertaining alterior motives.

Somehow I have garnered an audience -- and that puts a target on my back for every passing snake-oil salesperson.

Anyway.

Here's to pretend aeroplanes, which caused all of this in the first place. I shouldn't complain too much, becuase without them we wouldn't eat pizza nearly as often as I should like.

(if you're wondering what I'm referring to by "pretend aeroplanes", I started a YouTube channel during the pandemic. Apparently nearly a quarter of a million people watch the videos on it each month now...)

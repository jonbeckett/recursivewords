I had the strangest dream in quite some time last night. Or at least I think it was last night. I'm never quite sure when the dream happens - during the night, or in the moments before we wake up?

Do dreams happen in real time?

I've had several dreams that mapped out epic sagas, but somehow got conjured between waking up with the alarm clock, and waking up in a panic a few minutes after falling back asleep.

In the dream, I was in the living room of the house where I grew up. A girl that I went to school with - that I'm still in touch with from time to time - was curled up in a ball in the corner of the sofa - her arms wrapped around her legs.

We were both in our early 20s - with the past thirty years still ahead of us. It seemed like we were the only people in the house. It was sunny, with light streaming in through the blinds of the living room window.

While trying to figure out how to put some music on, she quietly murmured "we've split up".

I stopped what I was doing, wandered over, and sat down on the sofa next to her - doing my best to be supportive - asking questions - not giving opinions - wondering what the right thing say or do next might be.

After sitting next to each other in silence for a while she rocked forwards and got up.

"I should go".

While gathering her things the music system burst into life and started playing the opening bars of "Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now" by Starship.

Without a word she dropped her bag on the floor, pulled me up from the sofa, and started to slow dance with me - resting her head on my chest - looking away to one side.

"You're the only person I've told".

And that's when I woke up.

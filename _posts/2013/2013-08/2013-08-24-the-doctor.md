While walking into town a little while ago, I passed two elderly ladies, chatting in the middle of the footpath. One was perhaps 75 years old, and the other was easily 90, with a shocking auburn wig hanging lopsided on her stooped head.

This is the conversation I heard as I passed"I never really liked that last Doctor Whothere was just something not right about himgood actor though""Yes Gladys, I know what you mean. The one before him was much more like The Doctor, wasn't he"I grinned all of the rest of the way into town.

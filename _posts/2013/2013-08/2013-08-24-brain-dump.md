I've fallen completely off the blogging wagon in recent months, and I'm not entirely sure why. I'm resisting the temptation to explore the reasons, because it would make for quite possibly the most boring blog post ever seen by the human eye.

I have been on vacation for the last two weeks.

Last week was spent at "Rockley Park", a holiday park on the south coast. Our days were spent at the beach, in the games arcade, at numerous holiday camp shows, or visiting nearby destinations such as Brownsea Island, were Baden Powell camped with the first scouts. I also spent countless hours in the holiday camp outdoor pool with the childrenand somewhat miraculously taught our youngest to swim.

This week has been spent at home doing chores, clearing the decks, and wrenching the house into a state somewhat ready to start the new school year in a couple of weeks time. It's the first time I have had two weeks off in ages, and it's perhaps miraculous that we haven't all killed each otherwe're not used to spending so much time together any more. If anything, my main role this week has been peace keeper between our eldest and my other half; they are as stubborn as each otherAnyway it's Saturday night. While lots of single people are probably out with friends tonight enjoying a drink, I am sitting with the Chromebook at the dining table, the Hackers movie soundtrack humming in my ears, and the kids are asleep upstairs. I played chess against our eldest earlier (she is getting very good), and dominoes against all of them. They haven't figured out yet that I will play any game as long as it's not too taxing, and we can all play it together.

Ho hum.

This has been a brain dump on behalf of the "don't want to go back to work next week" party.

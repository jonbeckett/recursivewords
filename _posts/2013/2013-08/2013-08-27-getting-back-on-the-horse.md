I'm back in the office todayfor the first time in several weeks. I'm not sure how I feel about it at the moment. On the way in this morning there was a creeping dreada fear of what I would find myself walking back into.

Apart from 70 emails10 of which needed a replymy return has been remarkably low key. Perhaps everybody else has been on holiday too, or perhaps the rest of the world is feeling the same way I am about everything.

You would think after being away for a few weeks I would return rejuvenated, but exactly the opposite seems to have happened. I'm in limbo at the momentdrifting. Sometimes drifting is good, but I have no idea where the river is taking me at the momentor if I can change it's direction.

Perhaps it's time to change things.

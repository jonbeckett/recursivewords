This is my wedding ring. I would like to say it was forged by goblin silversmiths in the fires of Mount Doom, but that wouldn't be entirely true. It was actually forged by a real-life goldsmith in Witney, Oxfordshire, about twelve years ago. When it was new, it had an almost mirror finishnow it has a kind of weary, worn patinaa bit like me reallyIt's the only jewellery I ever wear.

I've lost it twiceonce in the roof box of the car while packing a tent away in a torrential rain storm (it turned up the next morning), and once in a children's toy box while tidying their room (it turned up several weeks later).

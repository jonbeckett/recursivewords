The morning has gone something like this so far; get out of bed, shower, brush teeth, get dressed, wander down the road to buy milk, make coffee and toast, make kids breakfasts (they wandered down while I was out), make more coffee, wash up, persuade the kids to get dressed, and then find something for them to do (it's raining outside).

The younger girls are playing Sonic Generations on the Xbox 360 in the loungearguing like cat and dog about what each other should be doing, and who's turn it is next. Our eldest girl is playing Moshi Monsters at the other end of the housewriting down all manner of codes on pieces of paper (I don't understand it at all). My other half hasn't shown her face yetshe has had a bad back for the past few days, so is trying to give it a rest.

I made dinner last night for everybodyspaghetti bolognesewhich would normally be easy, except of course my other half is vegetarian, and our eldest is Coeliacso you end up making two lots of everything; meat/non-meat bolognese sauce, and normal/gluten free pasta.

Anyway it's Sunday.

I have no plans today at all. The MotoGP race is about to happen in Brno, and following that the F1 race is happening at Spa. Somewhere along the way I imagine I'll be making lunches for everybody, but beyond that, nothing.

Nothing days are good sometimes.

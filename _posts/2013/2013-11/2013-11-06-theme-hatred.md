You know the one where you choose a theme for your blog pretty much at random, because you can't find anything you like, and you can't justify spending any money on a nice looking theme? Yeah that.

I have switched the look of this blog almost every day this week. I would like to think that there is some grand plan behind it, but of course there is notit's just me being indecisive.

I keep wondering about adding photos to the posts to make it more interesting, but that edges me back towards high quality contentI've been there before, and it kills the spontaneous nature of the posts I might write. Suddenly I can't post something because I don't have a pretty picture to go with it, or I can't find a good stock photo (for free) either.

I need to just choosesomething,and put up with it for a while.

We took the kids out to see a firework display tonightour part in celebrating either the capture, or the hubris (depending on your thoughts about it) of Guy Fawkes attempting to blow up the Houses of Parliament several hundred years ago.

After racing home from work in the dark and washing up after everybody else (they had already had their dinner), I had a brainwave. We had been given a bottle of mulled wine last Christmas by some good friendsour conspirators in pizza and movie nights from time to timeand had resisted drinking it until the weather drew in. Given that the beer stall at the fireworks display is usually a colossal bun-fight, I warmed the mould wine up, and took it with us in a flask.

If out walking in daylight, I would have been quite the sightwandering along with a flask poking out of one pocket, four plastic cups poking out of another pocket, and a backpack full of glow-sticks hanging from a shoulder.

The fireworks were spectacular, and re-enforced the stupidity of people that bother buying their own. While back gardens around the display lit up with pathetic excuses for rockets and mortars, we treated the entire town to a door rattling display. I'm surprised car alarms didn't go off following some of the more violent cascading explosions.

All good things come to an end, and this did too. After a few minutes walk we were back in the warm, and trying to find our cats. One of them seemed particularly unaffected by the entire episode, whereas another hunched wild-eyed underneath a cabinet in the kitchen.

It is now heading towards 10pm, and I still haven't eaten anything proper tonight (I wolfed down the remains of the children's spaghetti bolognese sauce mixture straight from the saucepan while stood in the kitchen with my bike helmet still on earlier). I guess it's really too late to make anything now.

Maybe a bowl of cereals.

In other news, I have switched the theme of the WordPress blog to "Pilcrow". It's been around for years and years, and it's a bit crapbut short of buying a professional theme from WordPress, it's probably the best of the minimal themes available. Let me know what you think.

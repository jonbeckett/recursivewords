After promising myself not to post photographs in the blog, I couldn't resist sharing this one.

I've just got in after standing on the green outside our house with the children for a few minutes, taking advantage of the temporarily clear sky. While aiming and focussing the telescope, and flicking the various clutches and brakes to stop them accidentally moving it, they grew instantly restlesshitting each other, chasing each other, and well being children really. That all changed as they took turns to look.

Miss 9 : "Wooaahhhh."Miss 13 : "Is that real?"Miss 8 : Silence.

Once they had all taken a turn I fished my mobile phone from my pocket and tried to take a photo. The above image is the result.

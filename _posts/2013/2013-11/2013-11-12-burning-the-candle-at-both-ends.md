After spending the entire day at work fighting with mountains of source code, I returned home to begin all over again. As mentioned a little while ago, I have begun doing freelance web development work again in my spare time. I'm not actively seeking projects; more "helping friends" (and getting paid for it). It works in all kinds of ways, because it forces me to stay current with the cutting edge of the web, and keeps me away from the garbage television or video games I would otherwise be filling my late evening with.

Over the next few weeks I need to establish some kind of rules around what I'm doing. This evening was an exception, because I was building virtual machines, installing software, and checking in the first version of the source code. Over the next few days the code will grow, transform, and come to life as I tie it into a simulcra of the client system. I pretty happy because I'm getting to use "Git" in anger for the first time. Git is a "source control repository"it helps look after and share what you have done with others, and lets people collaborate with each other on source code sensibly and safely. I have been banging a drum for it for perhaps two years in my day job, and getting nowhere fast.

Maybe I need a bigger drum.

Anyway it's already past midnight. Time for a cup of tea, and another few pages of "1927"the book by Bill Bryson about the summer of 1927 in America. I bought it from the Kindle store a little while ago, and have been engrossed by it.

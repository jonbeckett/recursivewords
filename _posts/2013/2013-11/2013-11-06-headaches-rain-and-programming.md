I've been working flat out on a programming project at work all morning (I'll spare you the details), and now find myself wondering where the morning went. Programming feels like jumping down the rabbit hole sometimes.

It's lunchtime. In a perfect world I would go for a wander in the fresh air and think about something else for a bit, but a stready stream of rain is laughing at the notion.

I still have a headacheI had one yesterday too. I'm wondering about stopping drinking coffee for a few days to see if it makes any differenceI've been drinking far too much coffee recently anyway (I think I'm actually immune to caffeine now). Maybe the headache is nature's way of shouting "GIVE THE DAMN COFFEE A REST".

Its 1:18am, and I'm sitting in a hotel bed a hundred miles or so away from home. My days have been filled with teaching people clever stuff, and my evenings have been filled with kicking a freelance web development project around the hotel room.

It's a curious existenceliving in a hotel room. After returning from the office at perhaps 6pm each evening, I haven't seen another sole other than when buying dinnerquite a change from home, where I'm surrounded by mayhem for several hours every night.

There is a pub connected to the hotel, but I have only set foot in it onceon the evening I arrived I mistakenly wandered into the pub while looking for the hotel, and then realised the hotel entrance was notinthe pub.

There is a 24 hour MacDonalds across the road from the hotel. I have eaten there every eveningwhile the food is absolute garbage (hardly qualifying the term "food"), it is cheap, and fast. I am famously non-discerning when it comes to food, and quite happily munched on a burger while continuing coding earlier.

While writing this post, I have been switching radio channels on the hotel television. I stopped watching broadcast television back when I worked in London, and never really got back into itat home I invariably download seasons of shows I want to watch, or stream them from the likes of Netflix.

Anyway it's getting late (he says, having started writing this after 1am). I have lots more nothing to get on with before I fall asleep

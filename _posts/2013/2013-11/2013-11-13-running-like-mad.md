The days and nights are running into each other at the moment, but it's a situation of my own choosing so I can't really complain. It would help if I didn't have to travel with work tomorrow and stay in a hotel, but that works in a strange way tooI will be able to focus on a freelance project I've been picking away at in the evenings.

I was going to write a huge, wandering, boring recounting of my thoughts about the work I have been doing, but realised a couple of sentences in that it is of no interest to anybody, so I deleted it.

One of the problems of working so much recently is I have nothing to write about. Nada. Zilch. It's not stopping my fingers hitting the keys though funny, that.

I have clothes hanging behind me in the study, and shoes on the floor. I'm going with smart casual, rather than all-out business clothes. I have to get up at perhaps 5:30am tomorrow, and catch the early train out of town. I could leave later, but then if any train connections go awry, it will make me lateand I hate being late for anything. I'm figuring that a half hour gap en-route will give me time to grab a coffee and wake up a bit.

I'm just trying to figure out what to take with me. I'm slowly getting better at packing light, but I'm not brilliant at it. I'm already taking my work laptop with me, so my phone, and the Nexus 7 tablet will probably do. I'm also taking my old MP3 player for the journey, purely to save the phone battery. It's only the size of a box of matches, so I don't really mind carrying it.

Time for a cup of tea, then bed I guess.

This has beensuch an exciting blog post (sarcasm implied by the italics fully intended).

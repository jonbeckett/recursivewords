I've been working on a fairly intractable round of changes and bug fixes to a software development project this morningthe same project that caused me to go home yesterday with a headache the size of Australia.

A few moments ago I looked up from the code, wondering how far away lunchtime might be. Nearly 3pm. It's not the first time I've worked straight through lunch, and it won't be the last. I mentioned yesterday that software development is often like "jumping down a rabbit hole"or in modern parlance, maybe "digging a cave in Minecraft". You disappear below the surface, and before you know it days have passed.

It doesn't help that I'm on my own todaythe only person on the entire floor. While it means I'm getting things done, it also means the opportunity to obsess over nerdy stuff, and completely and utterly lose track of time is enormous. as I have admirably proven.

Given the propensity to obsess, you might think that re-entering the world of freelance web development in my spare time (not sure if Imentioned that?) would be a bit stupid. The little free time I have will be munched up with late night coding sessions in the study at home, forgetting what the time is, and wandering out to make a drink only to discover that everybody else went to bed hours ago.

I probably need to invent another couple of hours in the day. I haven't actually started working on any freelance projects yet, but when they do arrive, I imagine I'll be writing about being continually tired, and complaining about anything and everything. I'm good at complainingonly most people never find out, because I only complain inside my own head.

I can't believe this week is almost over already. It seems like every day has whistled by, and every evening has been chewed up by something or other. Maybe the world will slow down a bit this weekend?I've spent the majority of the dayas with every other day this weekhunched over the computer in the office, swearing profusely, and occasionally threatening it. The more spectacular threats of retribution happen in inside my head "Billy Liar" style (you'll have to look that one up), almost reaching the heights of the chess match in Bottom between Richie Rich, and Eddie Hitler (you'll have to look that one up too).

I've pretty much blown the entire afternoon away trying to get something working thatshould have been straightforward. I'm pretty much resigning myself to not getting it working nowthere is only half an hour of the day left, and I don't anticipate getting anywhere at all with it.

I guess one way to turn the day around will be to buy pizza on the way home. Pizza fixes everything. And winelots of wine. And a crappy movie. Roll on the weekend.

In other news, you may notice the look and feel of the blog has changedyet again today (if you're reading this on a mobile, you're probably wondering what on earth I'm on aboutbut then I can't remember if I've configured the mobile theme settings anyway. Take no notice of menobody else ever does.

While running errands this morning, and attempting to make my way to rugby with the children, I started to suspect a number of camera crews were hidden on each road junction, and an army of extras scheduled to interact with me as I made my way from place to place.

I began complaining about it to my other half as we left the house, headed towards the rugby ground, and she dismissed me;"Of course, because you're never happy unless you're complaining aboutsomething".

At the exact moment she said it, a car swerved wildly into our path, and a pedestrian ran into the road. At an opposite road end another car skidded to a stop, and futher pedestrians seemed to take on a death wish."See!"She remained silent for the rest of the journey.

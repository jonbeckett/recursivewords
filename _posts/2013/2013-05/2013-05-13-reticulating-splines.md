In case you were banging your head against the desk, trying to recall where you saw the title of this post, let me put you out of your misery - it's from "Sim City". While the computer was busy loading the game, it would flash up various status messages about what it was doing - none of them made any sense at all, but they sounded tremendously clever.

I guess that's what I've felt like recently - from the outside I probably appear tremendously clever, but in reality I have no idea what I'm doing any more, and would struggle to tell people what I do if asked. I can almost imagine an interview;

"So what is it that you do?"

"Oh, well... umm.... I write software, I guess, and web stuff, and I connect things that didn't used to be connected, and I make things work better sometimes, and I make things do things they didn't do before... and sometimes I make things look pretty"

"Riiiggghhht"...

I can almost imagine slipping into Milton mode at the end (have you seen "Office Space" ?), and mumbling something about burning the office down if I don't get a piece of birthday cake.

Anyway. It's Monday, and that's all I have to say about that.

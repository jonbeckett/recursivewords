It's been a weekend. Really. Those are the only words that come to mind to describe it. I'm not quite sure where it all went (well, I am, but forming the last 72 hours into something approaching an organised account is beyond me at the moment). Let's turn it all into bullet points;Two days away with work : CheckSaturday chores (clean house, do laundry, etc) : CheckTake kids to big playpark in town : CheckHome for more chores : checkSunday morning running argument with other half : checkSunday afternoon walk along river with everybody : checkSunday dinner at the pub : checkSunday evening avoiding further arguments with other half : checkMonday morning (bank holiday) cutting grass and clearing wreck of a garden : checkMonday morning moving the Wii to the kids playroom : checkMonday afternoon visiting DIY store and fitting 5 shelves in eldest's bedroom : checkSomehow spending 300 ($500) in DIY store : checkMonday evening collapsing in heap : checkSomewhere along the line I also re-joined Tumblr, which even made me smile - given that I walked away swearing never to returned about a month ago. I'm not entirely sure what I will do beyond using it as a scrapbook, but it remains fun as long as you don't rely on it for anything. I have been a member there since they first went live in 2007, and am hoping Yahoo's acquisition may bring changes slowly. Anyway - back to work tomorrow. Do I play the stupid game where I stay up to avoid tomorrow, or not?

I'm installing World of Warcraft on the desktop machines at home. I played it under a free account last year for a while, and although I liked it, didn't have the time, or the long term interest to continue playing it - mainly because I had nobody to play it with, and couldn't be bothered with building friendships inside the game.

That's all going to change this week - I'm letting our eldest daughter into Azeroth with me, and will accompany her on her first adventures.

There are a couple of reasons for making the time to do it - one of them being that I have started reading "Ready Player One" with her, as a "Dad and daughter" thing. She loves the idea of a virtual world, so of course I happened to mention;

"you do know there isa huge virtual world that's kind of like a part of the OASIS?"...

"Really?"

"Yes... it's called Azeroth."

After checking the terms of membership last night, I discovered that she is old enough (there are no rules). I will still be shadowing her for the first few months though (or her Mum will). No doubt we will get hilariously killed by wargs while trying to show her how to do things...

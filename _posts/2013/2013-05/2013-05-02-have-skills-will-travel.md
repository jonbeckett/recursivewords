For the past couple of days I have been falling out of bed at a ridiculous hour, thundering across the fields towards London, diving underneath the ground, and flying out the other side of the city via Kings Cross to a far flung client site.

You might ask why (if you read this far).

I've been pretending to be a teacher. Teaching clever grown-ups how to use something expensive that makes them look even more clever. My lot in life seems to have switched from building stuff with computers to showing others how they might build stuff using clever tricks that don't require several years at college, and a lifetime of late nights geeking out over code.

I've been told in the past that I'm a good teacher, but I'm not really sure that's true - I'm not really teaching - I'm showing with enthusiasm. There's a difference. I'm fortunate enough to know lots of realschool teachers, and know just how good they are. I've seen them get through to children. I've seen their inventiveness, their creativity, and their persistence.

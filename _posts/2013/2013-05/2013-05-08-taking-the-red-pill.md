A dramatic title for a dramatic act. I just deleted all of the content from my Tumblr account, and posted the rabbit hole quote from The Matrix. After marvelling at my own cleverness, I wandered away, whistling, quite happy that I won't be back any time soon.

I'm not going to heap derision on Tumblr, and the people there - I made wonderful friends, and will continue to visit and catch up with them from time to time - I just won't be posting anything new. I'm already enjoying the random, unstructured, easy, almost careless way I can throw words into here. As soon as I am encouraged to post photos, the pressure ratchets up - the need to make things look nice (which comes entirely from my own mind) interferes with the entire purpose for me having a blog; to empty my head.

So. It is done. I know at least one person will be cheering, and writing me a congratulatory email. I will sit and smile while reading it.

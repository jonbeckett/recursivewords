Year by year, I'm getting worse. I'm not sure if it's a reaction to living with quite possibly the most untidy, disorganised person in the world, or just because I'm a bit mad.

Let's consider a few of the things that annoy me;

Toilet roll put on so the free bit is at the backBooks upside down, or back to front on a book shelfIcons all over a computer desktopShoes left where they were taken offPlates and glasses left where food and drink was consumedClothes left where they were taken offPlates and cups loaded badly in the dishwasherPlates and cups put away in random placesBikes left out in the rainCDs and DVDs left out of casesSinks and baths not rinsed down after usePeople walking slowly in front of mePeople who ditherPeople who mumblePeople who eat with their mouth openThoughtlessnessIgnoranceBelligerence I could go on. Of course I'm not suggesting I'm perfect - I've probably been guilty of most of the things on this list myself from time to time, and I know lots of people who are guilty of many of these things too. It's not the doing them once or twice that annoys you though - it is the continual chipping away...

If you ever see my photo in the news, holding up a McDonalds like the scene in "Falling Down", you know what happened.

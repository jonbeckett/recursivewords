There is a curious sense of freedom associated with "starting anew". This blog can be anything I make of it, and I can choose to use it how I see fit. I'm thinking the posts need to be "little and often". In the past I have chosen to "craft" posts - to perhaps think too much. If this becomes more of a random brain dump, I'm more likely to post to it, and it's more likely to reflect the "real" me.

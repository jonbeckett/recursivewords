A browser tab sat open on a blank blog post for several hours today, and nothing got typed into it. It's been that kind of day - going further sideways than forwards.

On the way to work this morning, a woman drove a four wheel drive truck along the footpath rather than wait for a gap in oncoming traffic. As I gazed in slack jawed shock, she smiled and waved.

I've stopped eating junk, and drinking anything alcoholic for a while. For the last couple of years I've been putting on weight ever so slowly. All I need to do is cut out the crap, and it will fall off again. I've done it before. Luckily I seem to lack any kind of addictive gene in my make-up to do with food or drink - I can pretty much take or leave anything. The stunned looks from co-workers when I passed up the offer of Jaffa Cakes this afternoon were priceless. I need to get back running. I would probably have gone out over the last few days, but managed to twist my knee and foot while vaulting the fence of the local playpark at the weekend. I was trying to catch a frisbee at the time, and failed hilariously. I keep thinking it has been a couple of years since I ran regularly, but it hasn't - it's been over 5 years. I used to run 5 miles every other morning before work - I would only run slowly, and it would take about three quarters of an hour. I still have a drawer full of running kit in the bedroom. For the last few days I have been getting up an hour earlier than normal. Who knew that getting up early would make the morning so easy? Today I even had time to run to the corner shop and buy emergency lunchbox food for the kids (somebodyforgot to click the submit button on the internet shopping basket full of our weekly groceries while she was being hassled by the kids - but we won't mention that). It's heading towards 9pm and I have no idea what to do with myself. Normally I would catch up with friends online, but I've just not been feeling it for the last few weeks. Kind of retreating from it all. Maybe I'll go read some blog posts...

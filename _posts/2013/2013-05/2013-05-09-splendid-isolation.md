In a perverse way, I'm kind of enjoying the fact that very few people have either found this blog, or are reading it so far. Of course this faux-anonymity will be short lived; the usual suspects will discover it before long, and read every single word. I know who they are through the wonders of web analytics.

Anyway... Thursday has arrived, and I'm cracking on with some work for a change. Of course saying that will make email arrive, the phone ring, hobgoblins to climb from the floor, and fire and brimstone to pour from the sky. Perhaps.

I'm waiting for a piece of software to install while writing this. You would never guess, would you.

The local running race took place this morning in town - the same race that I half-heartedly began training for several months ago (if you can count going running twice as training). Since then the world pretty much dumped on me from a great height, and I ended up not running again.

I have been away with work for three of the last four weeks - either spending hours sitting on trains each day, or holed up in hotels. Yes, I could have trained while staying at hotels, but that would invariably mean taking sports kit with me too - which I'm not about to do. If I can possibly avoid it I come home each night too - to avoid W having to run the house single handed. There's also the normal daily routine issue - we already get up at 7 each day to get the kids to school on time, and generally don't sit down again until 8 or 9 on an evening. Quite how other people find time to do anything (hobbies, outside interests, etc) is beyond me.

My escape on an evening - and this afternoon - is the internet. While the washing machine rumbles on in the background, I can sit among the boxes and bags in the room we laughingly call a study, and catch up with friends all over the world. I can write forgettable drivel like this post, and entertain myself while putting more loads through the dryer, washing machine, and the dishwasher.

When I logon to the internet, there is always the hope that a new email will have arrived, or a comment on the blog. When neither of those things happen, there is always a sense of deflation. I used the KIK messenger for a long time (and still have it installed on my phone), but quickly realised that I was the one making the conversation all the time. Not exactly a healthy way to build friendships.

This has been a pointless post on behalf of the "watching Sunday vanish" party.

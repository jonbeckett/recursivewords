I have been wandering around all morning humming music, and grinning.After racing home from work last night, and trying to clear the house up before the babysitter arrived, we set of for the best party we have been to in a very long time. The dance teacher that has become a legend in our children's lives was celebrating her birthday, and we were invited.

I haven't danced so much in years - which is saying something, because I can't dance. I'm rubbish. No, seriously - I really am rubbish - but I don't let that stop me. More than once either I got dragged up, or various friends dragged me up onto the dancefloor, and away we went.

I've been trying to remember some of the songs we danced to last night - really a cross-section of all the best music from the 60s onwards. One particularly memorable moment was the theme from "Fame" bursting from the speakers, and everybody in the place launching themselves onto the dancefloor.

Anyway... today is Saturday, W is out, the kids are up (and dressed!), and we're figuring out how best to spend the rest of the day. I foresee a visit to the cafe in the park, and a nice coffee while watching the kids run around like maniacs.

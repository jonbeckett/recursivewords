I'm in the process of downloading Eve Online - a massively multiplayer online role playing game where you get to play at being a starship captain. I doubt I will get much chance to play it, but it seems like a fun escape.

I'm always late to all these kinds of games, and I've never got good enough hardware to play them properly, but I'm not going to let that stop me.

If you have any recommendations for online games beyond World of Warcraft, or Eve Online, let me know.

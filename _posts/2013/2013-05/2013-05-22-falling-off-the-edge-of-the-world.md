For the last few days my balance has been all over the place. At first I thought it might have had something to do with going on crazy fairground rides with our eldest on Saturday evening, but I was fine on Sunday. All I know is that I got up on Monday, and my head was swimming.

After a bit of experimentation over the last couple of days, I've figured out that it's to do with rapid changes of orientation. If I snap my head one way, and then another, it throws my balance for a few seconds (but it does catch up). Approaching T-Junctions on the mountain bike is the worst; you don't realise how much you snap your head back and forth, checking different directions.

I've had this happen to me before - a few years ago. It lasted a few weeks that time. I'm hoping it will get better quickly. Before anybody comments, I'm sure it's just some kind of inner ear thing. If it gets worse I will go to the doctor.

After a lunchtime spent hacking around with an export from Google Drive, and a pile of disjointed and horrendously written Python code, I have uploaded the missing chunks of the archive into this blog. You will notice the archive widget in the sidebar, filled with a continuous stream of almost entirely pointless blog posts stretching right back to January 2003.

Oh my word - ten years. I never realised before. There are just over ten years of posts in this blog now. A decade of self serving detritus. Quite an achievement.

One day, when I'm feeling particularly idiotic, I need to start going through the old posts and tidying them up. There are a lot of missing photos, and huge quantities of badly formatted text. 2010 and 2011 are the worst effected, because they have been through the mill more than the rest - exported to Markdown, and imported back again.

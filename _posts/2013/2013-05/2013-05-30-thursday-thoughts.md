After a week or so playing with Google+ comments, I'm disconnecting them from the personal blog. They make sense for the techie blog, but not for this.

I'm watching the Ghost blogging platform with interest. It has the potential to out-strip WordPress, Blogger, SquareSpace and Posthaven. The markdown support is superb.

I can't believe it's already Thursday. I guess Monday was a bank holiday, which kind of explains the time-crunch.

I didn't get up in time to have any breakfast this morning. I did stop in town and buy granola bars on the way though. I now feel sick.

I have other things I should be getting on with, rather than writing this. I am not getting on with those other things. This is a surprise to nobody.

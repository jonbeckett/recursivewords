Weeks that begin with bank holidays always seem a little strange. Somehow it's already Wednesday. The morning is whistling past like some kind of fast train - and I don't appear to be on it. I feel oddly detached from the world at large today - I have all week really.

Starting over with the blog has been interesting. One of my best friends online has been doing all the reasoning and psycho-analysis for me - and writing the best emails every other day about what I should be doing (walking away entirely). Of course, the reason she can tell me what to do is because she knows me better than I know myself - which isn't hard. I also think the world of her - but don't tell her that - she'll get cocky. I would link to her blog for you to discover her awesomeness too, but she doesn't have one at the moment (let's gang up on her!).

I'm still undecided about Tumblr and Instagram. They play into a world of "disposable content" that I'm not altogether happy about - but that's probably a generational thing. The teens discovering the social internet now are far more comfortable with the idea of creating immediately disposable content - they don't set about writing, or publishing photos with any long term vision - and yes, I know is a certain irony, given that I have switched blog platforms so often over the years.

This has been a random post about nothing in particular. Get used to it. It's going to happen a lot. I guess I should get on with some work. Bah, humbug.

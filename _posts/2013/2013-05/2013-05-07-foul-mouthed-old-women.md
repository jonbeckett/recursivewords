Before leaving work this evening I called home to see if I needed to stop and get anything on the way. Silly question really. Twenty minutes later I found myself walking the aisles of the big supermarket in town, figuring out (a) how much I could carry in a basket, and (b) how much would fit in my backpack, or possibly on the handlebars of my mountain bike.

I wobbled off down the road like some kind of circus balancing act, traversing roundabouts and junctions with quite remarkable displays of luck and/or skill (delete as appropriate).

Now. It just so happens that about half a mile from home there is a maze like network of suburban roads, and a footpath that cuts half the distance out. On approach I swung a leg over the bike, and began walking. Twenty yards into the path I notice a lady in perhaps her 60s wobbling towards me aboard a shopping bike - no helmet, and smiling as she narrowly avoided other people on the pavement.

As she reached me, she smiled at me jamming my bike and shopping into the wall alongside the footpath, and something inside of me snapped.

"You shouldn't really be riding a bike along here"

What followed was a scene from a movie. The sweet looking gran on the bike unleashed a volley of four letter words, and she didn't stop pedaling either. I shook my head as her battleship hairdo swept past, and carried on my way.

Why is it ALWAYS old people cycling on the path? They never have helmets on, an in the winter they never have lights orreflective clothing. They take complete advantage of the good will and generosity of others. It's not right.

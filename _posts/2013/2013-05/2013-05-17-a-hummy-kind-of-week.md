I'm taking the chance to write a few words because I didn't stop at lunchtime. My bizarre mental ethics are telling me to get on with some work regardless.

For the first time in ages I have been in the office all week. Having a "normal" schedule has been odd, but also good. I began thinking about people who work 9-5 jobs in the "normal" world (perhaps I should coin them "the normals"), and just carry on like automatons from week to week, month to month, year to year.

Although I generally know what I am working on next week - sometimes a few weeks ahead - it's incredibly rare that I have any clue about next month, or the months after that. Sometimes it's dispiriting, but I shouldn't complain, because it always means fresh challenges. Ok, sometimes it means drudgery and despair, but those times are rare. Of course, "challenges" is code for "nightmares that make you think about leaving", but I've been here for years and years now, so can't really claim that as a legitimate drama.

We were supposed to be heading out this evening to have a Chinese takeaway with friends, but W messaged me earlier to tell me that probably isn't happening - she had a bad headache when she got in from work last night, so I imagine tonight will be a similar story. I'm hoping she will be better by tomorrow; we are going to a music festival with friends (my first music festival - woot!), along with several other families we know, and we are all taking the children with us.

Fingers crossed the weather stays dry... a few days ago the forecast was predicting something akin to the Great Flood.

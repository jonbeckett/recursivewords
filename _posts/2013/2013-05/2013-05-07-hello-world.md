Writing some kind of "hello world" post would appear to be the "done thing" at this juncture - the beginning of a breadcrumb trail leading on to all manner of adventure and intelligent debate. Who am I kidding? This is a blog. It's going to be full of navel gazing, ranting, and procrastinatory garbage.

One of the first decisions I have had to face while "starting over" has been how discoverable to make myself. Given that this is Blogger, I couldconnect the dots, and wire this directly to Google+. I'm choosing not to do that for the moment. I'm not sure why. Having at least a shred of anonymity is appealing.

So - given that I'm not going to give everything away, what can I say about myself?

In the daytime I am a software and web developer. I build the big corporate systems for companies all over the world that the staff like to complain about. I sometimes build stuff on the interwebs for other people to play with too, but those side-quests have become increasingly rare.

As highlighted by the sidebar of this blog, I live in a house with 4 women, and somehow manage to leave for work without pockets stuffed with hair bands, glitter, or crayons - although I did pull a very pretty hair clip from my suit pocket in a meeting with a client once. Three of the women are little people, who consistently challenge everything I thought I knew about myself. I sometimes write about them too, but their story is becoming their own as they grow up.

What else can I say about myself? I like "Game of Thrones", I love"Community", and I wish they were not making the movie of "Ready Player One", because I don't think they will do it justice.

Anyway... I should probably be getting on with some work. Feel free to say hello in the comments - I've removed all the idiotic validation rules - and I'll hopefully write some more rubbish soon.

While reading the posts of far flung friends this evening, I found myself drawn into their lives, their hopes, their happiness, and their sadness. It struck me that so many of us feel alone from time to time - despite the sea of thousands surrounding us.

The words of Tennyson came to mind...

It may be that the gulfs will wash us down It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles, And see the great Achilles, whom we knew. Tho' much is taken, much abides; and tho' We are not now that strength which in old days Moved earth and heaven; that which we are, we are; One equal temper of heroic hearts, Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.

I think maybe as I grow older, these words grow clearer with each year that passes. They are about us. We self analyse so much - we recall past adventures, both good and bad, and we judge decisions of the past, and decisions we have yet to make - and yet, we are still the same kids - we are still filled with the hopes and dreams of our youth. Sure, they might be buried under innumerable layers of cynicism, but they are still there...

I used to wonder if my lot in life was to sail across the shipping lanes of other people's lives - crossing paths from time to time, making friends, sharing experiences, picking people up, and moving on. I used to think it was all happening by chance.

Who really reaches out to strangers, reads, comments, likes, follows, subscribes, and hits the heart icon? It's more about free will than chance, or accident, isn't it.

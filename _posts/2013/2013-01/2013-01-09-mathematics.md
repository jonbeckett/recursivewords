Although I didn't study mathematics past college, it's always been something of a nerdy secret interest. While it's true that math occasionally crosses paths with my work (software development), the really interesting stuff - the pure maths - lives in an entirely different, but equally abstract world.

A couple of years before the kids entered our lives I entertained the idea of doing an Open University degree in pure mathematics - which would probably have meant re-treading the same qualifications I already have, because it's been 20 years (yes, really) - I've forgotten almost as much as I once knew.

Part of me wonders about doing the degree when the kids have grown up, but another part of me asks what the point would be - why chase an interest that has no practical use in my daily life? It's not like it's a small hill to climb either - it's a sodding great mountain.

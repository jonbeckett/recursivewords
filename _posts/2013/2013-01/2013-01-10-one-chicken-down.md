When I left the house this morning, I filled the chicken food bin, opened the door to their run, and only two appeared. Normally we don't worry about itthe remaining chicken is probably laying an egg. This morning something made me check, and there was no trace of her.

I'm guessing a fox either took her during the day yesterday, or she has died somewhere in the garden (maybe cornered by a cat). The kids don't pay much attention to the chickens anyway, so I'm wondering if this might mean the beginning of the end of us having chickens.

We had our first chickens a year or so before we had the children, and while the kids were small, they provided endless amusementour youngest daughter could often be seen in the days before she started school wandering around the garden in bright pink wellington boots with a long suffering chicken stuffed under her arm for company. Quite bizarrely, the chickens never seemed to mind.

For the last couple of years I have been pretty much the only person that sees the chickensI feed them and let them out in the morning, and shut them away at night. Beyond that, none of us really interact with them; they really are the easiest animals in the world to look after.

Anyway one chicken down. Who wants to bet I'll get home tonight, and the missing chicken will have re-appeared ?

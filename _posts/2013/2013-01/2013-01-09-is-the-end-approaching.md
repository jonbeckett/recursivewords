I've been caught in two minds about writing a personal blog over the last year - while I like to share thoughts, ideas, and opinions with the world, it all seems a bit redundant or irrelevant most of the time. If I tell any stories about daily life, I invariably filter the story so much that the stories are no longer interesting or entertaining.

I'm wondering if "personal blogging" is coming to an end for me. Signing up with WordPress and purchasing the domain name was an experiment of sorts - to see if a modest investment in a platform might encourage me to write again.

Our eldest daughter came home from School yesterday - her first day back after the Christmas break - and murmured something about her school friends getting iPhones, and iPads for Christmas.

She is 12 years old.

I am always accused of having a chip on my shoulder about this, but in what universe is it acceptable to buy 300 gifts for young children for Christmas? For one thing, they are not old enough to have an account to pay for anything on a phone or tablet in the first place - or to sign up for any of the big social networks. You can bet the phone or tablet wasn't the only thing they got either.

How on earth do people afford it, or warrant it ?

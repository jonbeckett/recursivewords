I've been sitting on the couch for the last ten minutes, wondering what to write that might describe the weekend. I'm struggling to come up with anything worthwhile. Life continued (mostly) as it has for any number of recent weekends.

On Friday night - quite unexpectedly - W arrived home from work having booked a babysitter in order to take me out for something to eat (I missed dinner with the boss from work due to the children being sick; ironically a second shot at that meal because I missed the work Christmas lunch while working on-site). The food was great, but the service was awful. We were effectively forgotten for much of the evening.

Saturday was spent knocking around the house - two of our children have not been well, so rather than take them swimming (something we had planned to do for weeks), we didn't do anthing. Of course "anything" is a relative term. We still washed dishes, clothes, and put junk away throughout the day.

I ducked out mid-morning on Saturday and bought a new mobile phone from Carphone Warehouse. After standing around for half an hour with our eldest daughter, we were finally served and I turned into the perfect problem customer - and it was a good job I did; getting a much cheaper (and better) contract than the one they first suggested. For the next two years I'll be carrying a Samsung Galaxy S3 around in my pocket.

Sunday ran on it's usual rails. While I took Miss Nine to Rugby, W took our youngest to Sunday School. Our Eldest stayed home and watched television all morning in her pyjamas. While we are becoming worried about her being such a loner, I'm guessing most girls of her age do the samie thing if given the chance. Late last week I looked into activities she might have a go at - Karate is leading the pack at the moment - only time will tell if she wants to do it.

I'm wondering how long Miss Nine might carry on playing Rugby. The boys in the team are already avoiding passing the ball to her - "boys being boys" really. While we always knew it would be unusual for a girl to play rugby - and she's had a great time until recently - as the boys grow older the divide between them is growing week on week. I dread to think what she might want to try out next... knowing her it will be Karate, or digger driving.

This evening I'm eating peanut M&Ms, helping drink a bottle of wine I bought from the Garage while making an emergency visit to buy toilet rolls earlier, and half watching rubbish television shows.

Roll on Monday, and an attempt to catch up on the work I didn't do on Friday...

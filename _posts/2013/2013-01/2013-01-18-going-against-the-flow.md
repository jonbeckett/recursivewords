Somebody I have followed for years, but never struck up conversation with collided with me mid-wander a few days ago as we quietly passed through each other's crashing avalanche of dashboard posts.

She commented that it often feels like your voice is lost on the internet - that the deafening roar of the masses will drown yours out - that you will never be heard - that the publication of our thoughts, ideas, and dreams is ultimately futile.

The pessimist in me wants to agree with her.

The optimist - which always defeats the pessimist - tells me to stand tall, and shout louder - to continue tilting at windmills.

Sometimes it pays to go against the flow. Think of it not as contributing to the raging torrent, but climbing onto an island. Somebody else might climb onto the same island from time to time, and a famous friendship might be forged.

It's Saturday morning, and Miss Twelve is at football practice accompanied by W - who is no doubt huddled at the side of the pitch with her Kindle. I went to the last practice before Christmas and somehow ended up stood next to another soccer Mom, and we talked non stop for two hours. This is unusual because I normally try to avoid talking to anybody, be that at school, the football pitch, the rugby pitch, or even while buying groceries.

Miss Eight is sitting in the lounge watching back to back childrens programmes on television. Throughout the Christmas break, our kids have only seemed to watch TV in the mornings - the rest of the day has been filled with computers, board games, and so on. The weather throughout the break has been awful - otherwise they would have been outside on their scooters, roller skates, hanging upside down in the playpark, or whatever.

Miss Seven had a sleepover at a friend's house last night, so I'll have to go and fetch her soon. I've been trying to get hold of her friend's Mum via email and Facebook this morning, but they are either submerged in mayhem, or I have the wrong contact information. Hey ho.

In other news, I'm guessing the decorations will start to come down at home today. I already ripped the garland off the cooker hood. We threw the tree away several days ago - we bought our tree late, and got perhaps the worst tree we have ever had. It dumped needles prodigiously, and ended up with bare branches in many places.

Time for another coffee.

Saying "I do not have time at the moment" is the easiest excuse in the world. Of course we have time - we can make time. How many hours do we spend each week watching television, listening to the radio, or any number of other things that are not essential?

Making time doesn't necessarily mean we will be able to conjure words when we sit down to write though I'm a fine example; I've sat here for the last few minutes pondering on what I might write, and have been distracted by anything and everything.

So what we really need is time, and minimal distractions. You would think, given the ambient noise in our house approaching jet engine testing laboratory levels, that I would be able to put up with hilarious levels of distraction on command. You would normally be right. While writing about something, I could probably ignore the house falling down around me, but if I'm sat here daydreaming, all bets are off.

Perhaps my chief skill - and one that has not diminished over the years - is the ability to write copious quantities of verbiage about nothing at all. This post is a testament to that.

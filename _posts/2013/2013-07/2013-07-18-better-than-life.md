It appears the incredibly lazy "journalists" at the Huffington Post just caught up with the series of photos that have been floating around the internet for at least the last 3 years. They were taken in a sex doll factory in California by a photo journalist calledZackary Canepari.

I think they are fascinatingnot from the "sex" angle, but because the faces look so real perhaps the scenes in the movie "AI" were not so far fetched after all? Of course there is a huge difference between a doll, and a self-aware, articulated cybernetic simulation of a human I doubt we will see anything even vaguely close for several hundred yearsmainly because there is no reason to do it.

Anyway who now has the eerie woman's voice calling "David. David" from "AI" in their head?(if you are wondering about the title, you need to read "Red Dwarf").

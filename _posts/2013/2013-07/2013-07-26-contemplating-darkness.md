While sorting through the various detritus in the study last night (we laughably refer to it as the studyit has more akin with Monica's junk cupboard in "Friends"), I realised how many books have been sat on the shelf for the last four years, unread.

Good books. Great books. "Stranger in a Strange Land" by Robert Heinlein, "We" by Yevgeny Zamyatin, "Brave New World" by Aldous Huxley, and perhaps the biggest challenge of them all"War and Peace" by Tolstoy.

I used to read all the time. Something needs to change. The chiefreason I'm not reading is because I'm surrounded by excellent distractions. The advent of social networks and instant messengers has been a kind of disaster in productivity terms. While the internet is often my escape, it is also my kryptonite.

Perhaps it's time to "go dark" for a whileto refuelto replenish.

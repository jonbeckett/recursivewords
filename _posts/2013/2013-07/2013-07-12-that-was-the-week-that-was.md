I'm not quite sure how I got through this week, but I didor rather all evidence points to the face that today is indeed Friday, I am no longer in the office, the kitchen is clear, and everybody else is in bed.

After a ridiculously hot cycle home, where I considered more than once that I might be experiencing exactly what it might be like to cycle into a hair dryer, I dragged my bike to the back of the house, and ran straight into our friends.

Of coursewe were having a barbecue tonight. I was going to cook.

I lit the coals, and while waiting for them to burn down a bit, changed into trunks and a t-shirt, and jumped in the paddling pool with the children. Even though the older girls looked on from the house in that disinterested way teens do, I eventually shamed them into climbing in too (they were already in swimsuits).

The hope was that jumping in the pool would help them all get over themselves, and break the ice for the rest of the evening. I challenged everybody to sit on the bottom of the pool on the count of three to take the shock out of getting wet (it's just a paddling poolit's almost arctic), and plunged in. We all sprang back out, and our friends daughter almost lost the bottom half of her swimsuit.

You know that thing where you can't un-see something? Yeah that.

Thankfully I had cooking to get on with, so dripped my way back across the garden, and left the kids to cause havoc (it worked by the waythey got over themselves pretty quickly).

It's now gone midnight. Our friends have gone home, I have drunk half a bottle of wine, eaten enough for a small army, washed up, put everything away, and now find myself sat in the dark typing this.

Where the hell did the week go?I guess this week marked my re-emergence at LiveJournal, which is something at least. I already know tomorrow is filled with a rowing regatta for our eldest, and Sunday will probably go to hell too then it will be Monday again.

The weekend hasn't even started, and I can see Monday coming.

While sitting here upon my Batman like perch, high above the social networks watching the posts drift past, I often see familiar shades of angst, loneliness, and longing from all kinds of people, in all kinds of walks of life, from all over the world.

People searching for somethingfor somebody. Somebody to share their life withto share their stories, their laughter, their sadness.

A couple of things have occurred to me over the years that I guessed everybody learned as they grew older, but evidence suggests otherwise; Girls very rarely notice guys with the character traits they have spent their life looking for, because those guys have already been trampled by the assholes that have no fear, scruples, or thought for anybody else. Guys worth knowing are intimidated by the girls, or the circle of assholes surrounding the girls they wish noticed them, and struggle to make a first move that convention dictates.

You can pretty much guarantee that every "best friends become partners" story started out with one burning a candle for the other secretly for years.

What am I saying here? Maybe that you should notice the quiet person at the back of the room. Notice the friend that always seems to be there. Be brave. Be bold.

The words of John Keating in "Dead Poet's Society" communicate these thoughts far more succinctly than I can;We don't read and write poetry because it's cute. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion. And medicine, law, business, engineering, these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for. To quote from Whitman, "O me! O life! of the questions of these recurring; of the endless trains of the faithless of cities filled with the foolish; what good amid these, O me, O life?" Answer. That you are herethat life exists, and identity; that the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse. That the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse. What will your verse be?

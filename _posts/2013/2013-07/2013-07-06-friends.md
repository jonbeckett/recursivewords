The local brewery opened it's doors for it's bi-annual open weekend this morningand a group of us made our way to it in scorching temperatures to partake of the free beer.

The sunburn and crowds were worth itmostly because I got the chance to see the girl I used to work with again. During a quiet moment (and remarkably while not drunk) I told her I missed her, and she leaned her head on my shoulder.

Sometimes the simplest action speaks volumes.

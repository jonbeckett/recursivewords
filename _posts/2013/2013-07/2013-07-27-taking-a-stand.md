I keep reading postsnearly one a day at the momentfrom someone or other stating their "rules" for participation in either a particular social network, or an instant messaging application.

Shut UP.

Who on earth gave you the right to dictate to others how they should use a free, open service? Yes, there are crazy people and douchebags out there, and yes, some people step over an imaginary line you have formed in your head, but that doesn't give you the right to go preaching to the world and it's dog about your ideas of morality, standards, or behaviour.

The rich diversity of cultures, personalities, characters, values, views, and opinions posted to the social internet are what make it so interesting. If we all fell in line with some model we invent for ourselves, there would be no debate, no inspiration, and no educationand that would be a disaster.

Embrace those that burn more brightly than yourself. Love them, or hate them, they change the worldthey make it interesting.

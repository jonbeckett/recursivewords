We sat across from each other for the best part of three years. In some ways she reminded me of my younger selfher ability to remember everything, and to work endlessly at problems. Of course I was never pretty, or a girl, for that matter.

She introduced me to the TV series "Community"I bet you were wondering why there was a picture of it at the top of the post. It was "our" thing, because nobody else even knew what it was.

She always dressed smarter than me. While this is not difficult (I dress like a nerdy developer slob in Think Geek t-shirts unless I am meeting a client), I always noticed when she looked nice. Of course I never said anything, because eyebrows would have been raised. "You look amazing today" would become "You've got your posh hair on today", or some other such stupid remark.

She was probably fifteen years younger than me, and while the moments of idiotic humour made us seem closer, she also provided a window into a time of life before marriage and childrenand made me realise that I am happier now than I have ever been. Being single is not a walk in the parkand neither is being in a relationship when you're not quite sure if it's going anywhere. In many ways the John Lennon quote applies;"Life is what happens while you're making other plans".

I never set out to meet my other half. After several years of car crash dates, and short lived relationships, we ended up together while not really paying attention.

Anyway this is getting away from the point.

I miss her.

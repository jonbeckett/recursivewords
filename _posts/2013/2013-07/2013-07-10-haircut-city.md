Before dragging myself into work this morning I stopped in town to get my hair chopped off by the prettiest lady possible. Normally this would mean the chain "gentleman's hairdresser" in the main street that has obvious rules on the appearance of girls they will hire.

There was another guy stood outside, and the lights were off. It was only five minutes after their normal opening time, but stillhow DARE they not be open, and disrupt anybody else's incredibly busy dayI wandered further up the street to another placewhere I used to get my hair cut until I discovered the pretty girls further down the road actually, that's a lieone of the pretty girls is a friend, so I kind of go there out of loyalty to herhonest :)After sitting and reading one of their newspapers while some businessman got his hair cut by the guy that always seems to open the shop, this stunning woman walks in, and invites me to go sit in front of a mirror.

Ahem.

Quite by chance while swapping stories with Mrs Gorgeous, she mentions the number of people's hair they have had to fix from the shop down the road the one where all the young girls work. I smiled, and wondered if they knew I had been going there to get my hair cut recently. While gazing at the picture of loveliness snipping away at my hair, I suddenly realised she was actually very, very good too.

Guess I'll be going there again.

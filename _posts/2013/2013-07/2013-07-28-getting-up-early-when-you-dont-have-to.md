It's Sunday morning, and for some reason known only to the depths of my brain, I was awake at 6:45am, and got up. Why is it that on work days, I will stare at the alarm clock until the last moment before I have to be up to make breakfasts, lunches, get showered, shaved, dressed, and so on - and yet on weekends, or while on holiday, I fall out of bed as soon as I wake up?

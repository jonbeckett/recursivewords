I seem to have been "off the radar" for months nownot really recording stories and thoughts as I used to. Sure, I've experimented with different blogs, different usernames, and so on, but I never seem to stay in the same place for more than a few days. I never get the chance to concentrateto invest time in anything.

Part of it comes from a busy home lifethree little girls, and a better half that takes on too much all the timeand part of it comes from a crazy work life too. This morning I was supposed to be working on a long document for a client I haven't touched it so far, and the morning is gone already.

I wonder when the world will slow down a bit ?

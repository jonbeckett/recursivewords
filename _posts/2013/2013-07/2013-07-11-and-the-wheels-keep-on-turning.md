The last few days have felt like I'm stuck in some kind of giant world-machine, swirling around, being thrown from place to place, and never being spat out. I would have probably written something last night, but events overtook meI got in from work at about 6:20 and discovered the kitchen I had cleared before leaving in the morning had been trashed. My other half was racing out of the door to a school meeting, and left a half-cooked dinner for the kids on the kitchen worktops for me to finish off. She has this weird ability of being able to get everything out, and put nothing awayso the kitchen kind of resembled a scene from Apocalypse Now.

I had to be at our eldest's school for a talk about the rowing club (oars and boatsnot shouting) at 7which left me about 20 minutes to eat, clear the kitchen, get changed, and have a wash before leaving the house.

We made it by the skin of our teeth.

After sitting in a room listening to the rowing coaches tell us about next year, and figuring out pretty quickly that our eldest isn't really "into" rowing any more (so why I was I even there?), we wandered home again.

The rest of the night (or what was left of it) was spent drinking wine, and watching an intentionally crappy movie on Netflix before heading to bed. Fun times.

Today is looking like yet another car crash day. I have a meeting with HR in a minute, for them to explain to me how I might "prioritise my time". In reality all that means is I have more work than I can really do, and they want to throw more at me.

Expect to see more disgruntled navel gazing later.

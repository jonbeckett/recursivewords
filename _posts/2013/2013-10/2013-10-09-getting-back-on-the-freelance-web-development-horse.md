I've decided to throw my hat back into the freelance web development ring. Just a few projects in my spare time. While the money will be nice, the real purpose it to keep my skills and experience current.

While I do a lot of web development at work, it's usually secondary to writing server code for corporate systems, and that's about as interesting as watching paint dry. The web has always been my "first love"my main interest, if you will. I can still remember launching Mosaic back in the early 1990s, and seeing the homepage of Yahoo render itself slowly across the screen.At the time, Yahoo was curated by hand, and you could still buy a paper directory of the internet in PC World.

Anyway. Time to fix my homepage up, I guesstell people what I can do, what I have done, and what other people think of it. I'm going to keep it very simple, clear and concise.

If you have a project you want to get started, give me a shout.

In the meantime, I'm tempted to start making themes for Tumblr, WordPress, and Blogger.

Miss Nine is home from her school trip. She spent the last week at an outward bound center, several hundred miles from home, with the rest of her school year.We wandered into town yesterday evening and were very nearly late; as we rounded the final corner towards the school we were greeted by a rugby scrum of parents surrounding a coach.

While scanning the crowd, Miss Eight's eyes proved their superiority over ours, spotting her sister through the jumble of people."THERE SHE IS!"Within moments there were hugs, kisses, and the beginning of an almost unintelligible download of memories and happenings from our little adventurer. Tales were told of "leaps of faith", of sleeping in a dormitory, of staying up late, getting up early, cooked dinners, postcards, muddy boots, and a hundred other things.

Outwardly, you might imagine our youngest had done really well over the last week without her sister. They are only 18 months apart, they share a bedroom, and fight with each other almost every day in the way that siblings do. They have never been apart for more than a day before.

When we woke up this Morning, W looked in on the children, and discovered Miss Eight and Nine climbing out of the same bed. Perhaps shedid miss her.

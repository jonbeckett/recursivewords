I haven't taken my temperature todayprobably for the same reason I rarely take tablets, or any kind of medication for anything really. I justknowI feel like shitI don't need a doctor to tell me. I alsoknow, oram relatively confident that I just have a cold. A bad cold. Not man-flu. Just a cold.

I got up today, made the breakfasts and lunches as per normal, and cycled into work. After being blasted by frosty dew filled air for a few miles on the mountain bike, I didn't actually feel that bad. Sitting in the office for a few minutes changed my mind pretty damn quickly. After perhaps fifteen minutes I had packed my work laptop into my bag, and set about retreating home to avoid infecting the rest of the office.

The "feeling crap" thing came back to haunt me on the way home. After dropping in at the local phone place to pick our eldest's phone up from being fixed, I realised my clothes were actuallywet. I wasn't so much "burning up", as "on fire".

I sat in the study for the rest of the day at homeI swear my ass is going to change shape to match an office chair at some point. The six miles every day on the mountain bike are really the only thing that stops me from being humungously overweight.

I wonder what it's really like for people that work at home? It must be difficult to stop working. This evening I stopped when dinner was ready because I was working on some code, and then started again after dinner for a bit because I wanted to finish something that was nagging at me. I used to do freelance work in the evenings, and it was a nightmareof my own making.

AnywayI just remembered there is a packet of throat lozenges in the kitchen (if my other half hasn't eaten them like candy). Fingers crossed

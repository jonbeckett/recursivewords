I wonder if any famous (or secret) mad scientists have ever measured the amount of time Friday takes to pass by. I'm pretty sure today is taking longer than yesterdaynot that I've measured it of course.(ten minutes pass while I make a coffee in the kitchen two floors below us)Ok. Drinks acquired.

Noted en-route that the lady living in the house opposite the office has a Porsche Boxter with a personalised registration"I8 OX". Does that mean "I Box", or "I ate ox" ? Perhaps she likes beef? Or perhaps she is a perfect representation of the type of person that drives a Porsche with a personalised registration. I'm not going to write the word because it will probably get me into trouble for using profanity. The word rhymes with "Tanker".

For the greater part of lunchtime I found myself tinkering with the "Readmill" phone and tablet app, after receiving an email from them informing me of a new version. Who knew that spam emails actually work sometimes? I'm kind of torn on the whole e-reader thingI tend to stick with Kindle, purely because I can't be bothered with managing lots of apps. I keep seeing the "Kobo" readers every time I wander into our local branch of WHSmiths (book seller, and stationer, for the international readers), which look exactly like a Kindle, but are not made by Amazon I know some people get their knickers in a right twist about the perceived injustice that Amazon has brought to the world.

I keepalmost reading a book each evening at the moment, but end up surfing innumerable crap filled websites when I go to bedeither on the phone, the tablet, or the chromebook. Last night I ended up writing emails to people I haven't heard from in a while. It feels like the universe is telling me to go read a book, and I'm finding any and every excuse possible to do something else instead.

This post is rather random, isn't it. This entire week has been like that, to be honest. Last night I spent the majority of the evening ferrying children to dance classes, and home again. By the end of the evening I had been to the primary school 4 times.

I wonder if we're having pizza for dinner this evening?

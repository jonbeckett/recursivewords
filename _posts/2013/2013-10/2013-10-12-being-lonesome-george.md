The rest of this post is going to make little sense if you don't know who "Lonesome George" was, so I'm going to give you the background first."Lonesome George" was the last known Pinta Island Tortoise. In his last years he wandered the Galapagos Islands alone, and was widely regarded as the rarest creature in the world.

I can't help identifying with Georgeexcept in my case the species would be "blogger". The term "blogger" has come to mean anybody that posts to an online publishing platform, but a decade ago it quite specifically referred to those of us publishing our daily happenings via an online journal"blog" was a contraction of "web log".

We are slowly but surely becoming extinct.

It seems that as soon as a publishing platform becomes popular, marketing morons arrive en-masse, and pollute all available content with spam, niche junk, and link-baitto such an extent that the content worth finding is no longer discoverable.

If you happen upon this blog, and write a personal blog of your ownfree from reblogs, advertisements, agendas, and other such detritusplease let me know. Please tell me that I'm not the last man standing.

I wrote an insane chunk of programming todaywhile sickand am quietly pleased with myself. Just the fact that I was able to wrap my head around a multi-dimensional problem was enoughthen when the code worked first time (I envisaged an hour of soul destroying debugging), I could quite happily have cartwheeled around the room. Doing so would have caused an avalanche of brick-a-brack, but that's beside the point.

As I write this, I'm sitting in the study, wondering what to do with the remains of the day. Perhaps a good book? Perhaps a trashy movie? Perhaps a video game? Perhaps an early nightIt didn't help that I was up until 2am playing video games last night. Quite how I did itwith a streaming coldis anybody's guess. I couldn't sleep, so ended up charging around the pretend streets of Monaco for a couple of hours. When I finallydidcollapse into bed, I was completely wired, and didn't fall asleep until perhaps 3am.

I need a life. You knowone of those "proper" lives, with friends, and nights out, and stuff like that. Maybe everybody feels like this when they've been sick for a few days though. I'm going stir crazy from sitting around the house.I realised earlier that I hadn't shaved since Saturdayor really looked in the mirror. Ten minutes later the electric shaver was trying to recover from a heart attack, and I had an itchy (but smooth) face.

I'm going back to the office tomorrow. If I don't, I'll grow a beard, and that would NOT be good (think about itsoftware developer, beard, sandals, pocket protector it's a slippery slope, ending with an interest in Fortran, and the PDP line of mini computers).

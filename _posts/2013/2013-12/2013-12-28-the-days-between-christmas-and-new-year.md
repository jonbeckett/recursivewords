I always feel the few days between Christmas and New Year are a little disconnected from the rest of the year. Perhaps this year that sense is heightened because I am not workingat all. Apart from being on-call yesterday, the days are my own.

Many people are already talking about new year's resolutionsabout things they will change, things they will start, things they will end. I'm just hoping to keep goingkeeping putting one foot in front of anotherkeep on keeping on. I tend to to think whatever happens during the coming year will happen regardless of wanting, or not wanting it to. Of course we can decide to make things happen, but my decisions are typically chosen based on least impact to others. If I can slip from day to day quietlywithout discussion, debate, or conflictI will.

While kicking around the house, or wandering to the park with the children, I am often reminded about Mickey Flanagan's standup routineabout the value of doing "f*ck all" (I don't know why I'm censoring), and the various tactics he employs to do as little as possible on purpose. Buying the cheap kettle because it takes longer to boil, watching the bath fill, and disproving the adage that a "watched pot never boils". I end up grinning while wandering along, no doubt causing others to wonder if I'm a bit of a lunatic.

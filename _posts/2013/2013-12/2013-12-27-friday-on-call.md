Today I am "on call" for work. I can't complain, because I requested the entire Christmas period offtwo weeksand have only ended up having to cover support calls for one day from home. I brought my work laptop home with me, but have so far not had to power it up. Having said that, I'm now expecting a serious "system down" to appear in my in-box at any moment.

It's mighty quiet around here. W is ill again, so has spent the majority of the day on the couch. As is the way with the younger children, they want to be in the same room, so are annoying the hell out of hermaking noise, shouting, fighting, arguing, and so on. I'm pretty sure their capacity for annoyance has some kind of inverted exponential relationship to the peace and quiet you might want.I guess they're just being kidsif they weren't high spirited, we would worry there was something wrong.

I have another hour of half watching the email in-box at work before I can log off for the next nine days. Nine days filled with as little as possible (read: multiple trips to the rubbish tip, hours and hours of ironing, hiring a skip, clearing the garden, and half wondering if the snow will ever arrive that was predicted several months ago).

Our youngest daughter just wandered into the roomhumming as she arrivedwith an iPad under her arm."It's flat".

Conversation over. She handed me the iPad, and must have imagined I would wave some kind of magic wand over it. Charging things, lifting heavy things, washing up, and putting things away seem to be my useful purpose in lifeohand cooking all meals, and putting children to bed single handed every day.

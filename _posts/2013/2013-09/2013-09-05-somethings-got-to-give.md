I am in a blogging black hole of my own making. Written posts go to WordPress. Words are cross posted to LiveJournal by hand. Photos go to Instagram. Photos are cross posted by Instagram to Flickr, and Tumblr (and occasionally to Facebook, and Twitter).

It feels like I have too many fingers in too many pies. If all my writing and photos existed in one place, it would give friends one place to find meone place to catch up. In a perfect world I would shutter everything, and strike out on my ownperhaps at my own domain. The problem is, I have friends at each networkFlickr, Tumblr, WordPress, Facebook, Twitter, Instagramand while there is some overlap, each community tends to be distinct.

I'm happy cross-posting for the moment, because I don't think there is an answer, but longer-term, I need to do something. Maybe it will center around the new "Ghost" blogging platform that John O'Nolan's team is working on

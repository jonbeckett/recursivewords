Last night we headed out with friends to a big hotel on the outskirts of town, ate a wonderful meal, applauded the local radio station awards, drank rather a lot of wine, and had a fantastic evening. I was going to tell the story of the nightand began doing sobut found myself censoring to such a degree that the entire exercise became almost pointless.

Rather than tell any stories, perhaps the more relevant thought echoing around my head today relates to "me", and "friends". I have never really thought of myself as having many friendsand yet last night I was surrounded by them. Even amid the mayhembeing beckoned repeatedly to the dancefloor, being hugged by somebody I had never met before, or wandering home in the early hours telling stories and filling the silent streets with laughter, it didn't really occur to me.

I am lucky to count so many wonderful people among my friends. I need to make more time in the real world for them, rather than existing as an avatar in Twitter, Facebook, or an Email reply.

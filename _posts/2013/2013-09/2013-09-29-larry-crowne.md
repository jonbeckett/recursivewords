While flicking channels earlier this evening, and contemplating turning in for the night, I stumbled upon the opening scenes of the movie "Larry Crowne", and got completely sucked inagain.

I've seen the movie twice now. I'm still not sure why I like it so much. Perhaps the gift of actors like Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts is that we can find an element of ourselves in the characters they portrayeven if only in a passing moment.

While watching the movie, it struck me that very few of you "out there" on the internetknow meat all, and that if parallels might ever be drawn with a personality to better help you know me, they might probably be drawn against Larry.I also found myself likening a number of girls I know to Mrs Tainot.

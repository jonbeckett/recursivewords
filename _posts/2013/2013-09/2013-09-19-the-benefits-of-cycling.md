I just came across this list of "benefits" of regular cycling while looking at another website, so thought I would go through them, and comment.1. Cycling gives you a healthier heart and immune systemCycling is associated with improved cardiovascular fitness, as well as a decrease in the risk of heart disease. Studies also show that moderate activity, such as cycling, can strengthen the immune system and contributes to fighting of illness.

Completely agree about the immune systemI have had perhaps one day of sick in the last 3 years.2. Cycling can help you lose weightCycling is a great form of aerobic exercise and a brilliant way to burn calories. The faster you cycle, the more you burnmeaning it's entirely up to you to set your pace. Cycling also has the added benefit of ramping up your metabolismeven after the ride is over.

I don't agree with thisor at least not the distances I travel (6 miles every day). I have ended up with legs like tree trunks, but in my experience diet effects weight far more than exercise.3. Cycling tones your musclesNot only does cycling help you burn calories, but it also helps tone your muscles. In the lower half of your body cycling works your calves, thighs and bottom; while in the upper half it gives your shoulders and arms a work out too. Cycling is also easier on your joints than other high impact activities such as running, but still helps you get into shape.

Yep. I have legs like tree trunks. The effect on your calves is really down to your foot position on the pedals you can spot people who don't normally cycle by that alone.4. Cycling reduces stress, mental illness and anxietyCycling is believed to give participants a sense of wellbeing and is said to reduce anxiety, depression and other psychological problems. It's also thought that its repetitive clockwork movements have a soothing effect on the body.

I agree with this, but not for the reason they say. My time on the bike is "alone" time, and creates a bridge between work, and home. For those few minutes I'm not thinking about work, or home.

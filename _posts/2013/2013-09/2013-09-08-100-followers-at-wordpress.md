I know it looks narcissistic to post about a particular number of followers being crossed, but given the number of times I have switched blog platforms over the last few years, it's pretty miraculous that I've stayed anywhere long enough to pick up any followers at all.

Of course they are not really "followers" I imagine the 100 will be made up in fairly equal parts of those who read regularly, whose who read once and never returned, and those who only show an interest in other people's blogs in the hope that you might visit theirs (they can go suck it, for what it's worth).

If you thought my chequered history with blogging platforms is impressive, it's nothing compared to the origin of the blog posts. We're talking about Windows 7, Windows 8, OSX, Ubuntu Linux, Linux Mint, Android, Chrome OS, Debian Linux, and moreand while the Google Chrome browser is a constant among those various platforms, it doesn't mean I always used the web editor either. I'm equally at home using a text editor, a terminal, or a fully-blown word processor. I will admit that the geekiest option will always appeal to me (in my case, entering a blog post via an SSH connection to the machine at home, running a terminal app within Ubuntu called "Word Grinder"). Yes, I am mad.

Anyway. 100 followers. Thankyou for taking the time to read my fantastically variable output, if indeed you do. I promise to try a bit harder throughout the remainder of this year at least, and actually write something worth reading.

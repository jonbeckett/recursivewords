Late last night my pocket began singing to me. Given that I had not been drinking, I wondered if I was going mad. A far more plausible explanation provided an answermy mobile phone had lost it's mind.

While not randomly launching applications, it gave out intermittent chirps, and gained some kind of extra-sensory perception, where it could react to fingertips that hadn't actually touched it yet. Final confirmation of it's mental episode arrived after plugging the charger in, when it announced it had discovered a new device, but obviously not something that could feed it any electricity.

This morning I arrived at the local phone shop, phone in hand, and explained it's fate. After a cursory examination of the phone, the guy behind the counter began typing furiously for several minutes at his terminal."We will need to send it off""Can I borrow a handset then, so I can still receive phone calls?"He didn't respond, finished keying things in (after asking for my contact phone number again), and wandered off to the store room, returning with a white boxlabelled "Standby Phone". Out of the box came a small white Samsung candybar phone. I would love to tell you what model it is, but I have no clue. Five years ago this little handset would probably have beenquite good, but history has been particularly unkind. Two cups and a piece of string would have been almost as good an alternative.

All was not lost however. I have a work phone, which normally lives in a desk drawer unless heading out to a client site. It too is rubbish, but at least has a touch screen larger than a postage stamp, and enough memory to install a few "important" apps you know; KIK, Tumblr, Instagram the kind of apps you really need (stop laughing).

While searching for something new to listen to last night, I tripped over the biggest elephant in the internet room in recent memory"Wrecking Ball"the next release in Miley Cyrus assault on the YouTube server farm.

At the time of writing48 hours or so after the video's appearance, it has racked up over forty million views. Journalists hoping to join the wave of interest and rack up some traffic have written swathes about their disbelief, shock, horror, and dismay. They have a very short memory.Madonna, Lady Gaga, Kylie Minogue, Pink, and countless others have made far more provocative videos in the past.

It's time the media stopped trying to be judge, jury, and executioner. Forty million people can make their own mind up.

Imagine your life is a river. It starts quietly, calmly, and slowly, but as time passes it travels, grows, experiences turbulence, droughts, floods, good times, bad times, happy times and sad times. Sometimes you're paddling to get somewhere, sometimes you're drifting. Sometimes the current sweeps you towards unanticipated happiness, sometimes to unimaginable despair.

Along the way you cross paths with other riverssome join you for a moment, some for a little whileand then some rivers become intertwined with yours, and you never really untangle them. Sure, you might eventually be thrown from the tumult onto a new path, but your time in the crashing surf will change you, and you will never forget.

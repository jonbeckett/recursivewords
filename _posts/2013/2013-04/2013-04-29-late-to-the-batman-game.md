While wandering back from the swimming pool on Saturday afternoon we accidentally on purpose found ourselves in the local Computer Exchange place (read: nerd pawn shop) in search of cheap video games. A few minutes later I found myself stood in the queue with "Batman - Arkham Asylum", and "Batman - Arkham City" in my hands - for less than a fifth of their original sale price.

I finally got a chance to play them last night.

Stunned. Amazed. I sat, grinning from ear to ear for the best part of an hour, running around the corridors of Arkham Asylum with the "Caped Crusader", pretending. My other half rolled her eyes when I turned to her towards the end and said in my best throaty whisper "I'm Batman..."

You see - beyond the occasional late night foray at the Formula One racing game, I don't really play video games any more - life, chores, expectations, and obligations have pretty much sidelined them.

Of course - being a software developer in the daytime, I found myself pulling the game apart in my head almost immediately - looking at the rendering, noticing they were using the Quake engine, figuring out the various game mechanics going on. I need to stop doing that, and just enjoy the damn game.

I guess it might help if I had been into the comic books growing up, but I was not. My experiences of Batman really go no further than the various movies. Apparently the video games use the same voice actors as the cartoon series, but that's kind of lost on me.

Anyway. Here's to the hope that I can find the odd hour over the next few weeks to "be Batman", and go kick the crap out of baddies in Arkham Asylum...

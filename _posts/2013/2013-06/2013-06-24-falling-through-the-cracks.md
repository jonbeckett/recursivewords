This post has sat in an open window on my desktop for over an hour so far. I guess most of the reason it got no further than half a sentence (that I just deleted) is mostly because it's Monday. I like to blame a lot of things on "it being Monday"it's an easy excuse, and it's a good one, because everybody can identify with it.

If you won the lottery, and never had to work again, would you lose track of the days? Maybe weekends would become your hell, because the plebs would all appear that are normally at work? Perhaps you would entertain yourself by only leaving the house on weekday lunchtimes, and get in the way of people who are trying to get something done during their lunch-break?If you had no concept of days, Monday wouldn't mean anything any more, would it, and by inference, you would never stay up late on Sunday night avoiding the arrival of Monday eithernot that I ever do that, honest.

I sometimes wonder how much I understand about the world. While sailing a fairly straight course over the last few days, chaos has surrounded me.

It began on Saturday when our eldest daughter exploded on us. Fury, temper, fire, brimstone, and everything in-between. On Sunday morning it escalated into a full-on shouting match with my better half, who stormed out of the house to spend time with the younger children at one point.

On Sunday night I received word from a wonderful friend on the other side of the world that the relationship she has been carefully kindling for the last several months had fallen apart at the seems.

This evening while travelling home from a client site with work, I received an email from another friend on the other side of the world. A photo of her hand, with a sparkly band on her ring finger.

On one side of the world, huge joy and tears of happiness. On another side of the world, depths of despair. On yet another side, turbulence, storms, and disquiet.

Somewhere in the middle of it all, I plod onone foot in front of the otherbeing reliablebeing dependablebeing predictable. I secretly kind of like itbeing there for others, being the calm in the storm, being the sticking place for other people's courage.

Don't tell anybody though, ok?

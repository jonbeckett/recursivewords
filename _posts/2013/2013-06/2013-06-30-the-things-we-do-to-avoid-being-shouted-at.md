I don't think it would be entirely innacurate to make the statement "I hate gardening more than anything else in the world". Actually, there are a few other things that trump it, but they tend to be people. These people have no idea about my resentment of their behaviour or existence, because I'm too good an actor, but anywaygetting sidetracked.

This weekend was spent avoiding being shouted at by doing gardening yesterday, and building a sodding shed today. A really cheap wooden shed. And painting the damn thing.

I now smell of wood stain, sawdust, and sweat. It's a heady cocktail that you're not going to find for sale anywhere any time soon. I'll be jumping in the shower in a minutethe second shower of the day so far.

I guess I should make some kind of comment on this blog movingagain. Last week I started drawing the little cartoons, and after thinking about it, realised the username I was using everywhere was the best username for the cartoonsso have had to lift everything in the airagain. You never know thoughmy prophecy about becoming a gazillionaire through the cartoons could come true, and I'll be able to live the fantasy underpant-clad life of a couch potato for the rest of my days.

Or maybe not.

Some good did come from the weekend. Late this evening I played Badminton with the girls in the back garden. Our middle girl has by far the worst coordination I have ever seenbad enough to make whoever plays against her almost lose through laughing. On one occasion she took six tries to even hit the shuttlecock away from herselfnot that her continual failures dented her enthusiasm or gusto in any way, shape or form.

Anyway. I smell. Shower. Now.

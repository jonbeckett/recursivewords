After posting a scruffy cartoon of myself on Tumblr the other day, a couple of friends around the internet banded together into an army of two or three, and eagerly asked if this might be the beginning of an online comic strip.

It's not the first time I have considered it.

I thought about it, then I thought about it some more, and then I finally acquiesced. I have set the bar pretty spectacularly low on purposeI'm only going to draw single panels, and they will only be on scraps of paper. For the time being it is not going to be in colour, or look anything like professional; I just don't have the time or the inclination to produce something even vaguely professional looking.

Anyway. There it is. I'm doing a web comic. Starring myself. I must be mad.

I'm not entirely sure what happened to this week. It started badly, carried on being bad, and has now kind of fizzled out into the weekend (which will in all likelihood be monumentally rubbish, just to keep the whole downward spiral thing going).

There were no real "disasters" as suchjust little things that chip away at you. I've arrived home every evening this week pretty much drained, annoyed, or angry with the events of the day. Usually the trigger was nothing, but it was enough to tip me over some kind of happy edge, into a pit of despair funk of sorts.

Luckily, when I return home on an evening I am greeted by three of the most amazing little girls in the known universe, and they make me pretty much forget everything within minutes. We sit down at the dinner table together, eat, drink, and tell each other what we have been doing. It started as trick to get the girls talking when they were young, then it turned into an upheld family values tradition, and now it has become a time of the day that we all look forward to.

I'm drifting alarmingly away from the title of this post. After a week of horrible nastiness, today has been relatively ok so far. I still don't know what I'm going to do with all these little doodles I keep drawing, but hopefully a solution will present itself before long.

As Geoffrey Rush said in "Shakespeare In Love" (and I am probably going to mis-quote, because I'm not going to check it);It will all turn out alright in the end. It always does. It's a mystery.

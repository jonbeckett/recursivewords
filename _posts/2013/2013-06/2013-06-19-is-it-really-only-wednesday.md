I don't seem to have anything earth shatteringly interesting to write about today, but I'm not about to let that stop me. I need a break from the stuff I'm doing at work, so bashing a somewhat random collection of words into the keyboard would seem to be a suitable diversion.

Now I just need to think up some random words. Maybe another coffee might help.(Ten minutes pass while I wander down to the kitchen, boil the kettle, and then scald my hand while pouring my own drink, because I was too busy daydreaming)Ok. I have thought of something to do. Since I moved the blog back to WordPress, I've not really been reading anybody's blogs. Yes, I knowshame on me, and all that good stuff. All those people I have been reading for years? All five or six of you that are left from that time we all did the first NaBloPoMo together? Yeah totally not been reading any of your stuff for the last few weeksand I feel pretty guilty about it too.

I would like to say "I just haven't had time", but that would be a big fat king sized lie. Over the last few evenings after washing up and getting the kids to bed, I have been switching the XBox on, and pretending to be a race car driver. A really good one, it turns out, but you really don't want to knowSeeI've gone hilariously sideways already. Blogs. Reading. Concentrate.

I just cracked open the Python script I wrote some time ago to scrape the URL of people's blogs from the posts of other people's blogs. The oh-so-very-clever plan here is to go and read people's blogs that have commented elsewhere, because they are probably "into" the whole blogging thingand if they write great posts, that will probably encourage me to write passable posts.

Lots of probablys being thrown around here todaySo! If you see a like, or a comment from me today, you'll realise exactly what's going on. I don't usually write inane posts such as this onethey are usually about something horrific the kids just did, or some godawful hotel I'm staying in with work, or some other such tale of woe. Just so you know.

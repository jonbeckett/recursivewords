I was kind of hoping that Friday would redeem the week for me. I can't say the signs are great, to be honest.

After falling out of bed a little after 7 and going through the usual sprint to make breakfasts and packed lunches, and turf the girls out the door towards school, I was in the middle of packing my own bag for work when the phone rang. Surely this can't be my other half who only pulled out of the drive in the car 30 seconds ago?"Did you put the bin out last night?""No. I was about to do the recycling last night, and you said you had done it""I only did the recycling."That last comment automatically makes everything my fault. I shouldn't have presumed that somebody walkingto the bins would mean they might have had the presence of mind to drag the one being picked up in the morning ten yards down the drive too. Oh no. So we will no have a heap of rubbish on our drive for the next month, and I won't hear the end of it.

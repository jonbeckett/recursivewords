I had planned on taking our eldest daughter swimming this afternoonbut then the post arrived this morning with her school report, and all plans went out the window. It's only the mid-year report, but it was spectacularenough for us to all gather in the kitchen and throw all manner of praise at her."I think this report deserves something special""Like what?"A couple of hours later we found ourselves sat in the darkness with popcorn, chocolate, and fizzy drinks as a crumbling Krypton unfurled itself before us. "Man of Steel"perhapsthe movie of the summer.

I can't remember being affected so strongly by a movie in quite some time. I realised it was going to be a little different early onwhen Clark fought to save the oil workers and braced himself against the collapsing tower, I suddenly realised every muscle in my body was also flexing to somehow "help" I grinned, look sideways at our eldest who was staring wild eyed at the screen, and held her hand.

I left the movie theatre with her fingermarks etched across my palm, and endless stories to relate on the way home"oh, remember when this happened", "oh my godremember when that happened"One of the most memorable momentsfor mewas the death of Jonathan Kent. I'm not sure if it's because I'm a parent now, but it really got to me. If you've not already seen it, you need tothen you'll understand. Especially if you have children.

It's funny last night while flicking through the television channels Henry Cavill turned up on a late night chat show over here, along with Amy Adams and Russell Crowe. I couldn't help noticing that he has the same aura that Christopher Reeve hadand then some. A cross between a gladiator, a boy scout, and an olympian athlete. He's almost too good to be trueand that's why a new generation of children will remember him for decades to come.

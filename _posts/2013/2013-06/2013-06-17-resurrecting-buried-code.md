This is one of those rare times when I can talk about what I'm doing at work, although I'm not going to be tremendously specific about it. I'm resurrecting source code I wrote two years ago to hand over to a clientreading it, commenting it, and generally getting it to a state where I am happy they can see it.

It's kind of interesting in a nerdy way, because you see the first time you did things a certain wayand also see things that you've started doing differently. Most of the kind of things I work on are similar, so the way I do things evolves over time.

Anyway. Enough geekiness. I need to listen to music, drink coffee, and comment code.

As you were.

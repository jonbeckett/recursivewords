This afternoon I connected to XBox Live one more time - to "Forza Motorsport 4". I had never played Forza 4 online either, and thought it might be interesting.

At the first attempt, half the field vanished into the distance. Afterwards I realised why - they had all built their cars to suit the race. I set off to do the same.

Ten minutes later I rolled up at a random track with my un-tested car. A small family runabout with it's insides, engine, suspension, transmission, wheels, and tires replaced.

I won three races in a row.

Then something entirely predictable happened - nobody would play me any more.

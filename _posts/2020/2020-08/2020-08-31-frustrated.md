I'm stepping away from the social internet for a while.

Everywhere I look, all I see is keyboard warriors writing at length about politics, social injustice, gender bias, racism, and any other thing that has triggered them on a particular day.

Here's the thing - social networks surround people with those that share similar views - so all they are doing is preaching to the choir. Here's another thing - most people don't want to start a conversation - they just want to promote their often badly informed views and opinions as widely as possible.

If those expounding at length about the injustices surrounding them invested anywhere near as much effort in actually doing anything, they might succeed in moving the dial a little, rather than just making a lot of noise about where it's pointing.

Of course the internet isn't entirely full of soap-box activists. There's a quiet army of regular people, just trying to get from one day to the next without being called out, or drawn into anything too horrendous. That doesn't mean they don't care.

If you see me posting about flying pretend aeroplanes, exploring imaginary planets, or adventuring through sewers as a mad Italian plumber over the coming weeks, you'll know why.

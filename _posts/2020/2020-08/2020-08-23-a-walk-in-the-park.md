We went for a walk this afternoon in Basildon Park - about an hour from home. Perhaps the highlight of the walk was a dragonfly deciding to land on my knee while sitting on a bench, waiting for the rest of the family to catch up.

Quite how my family manage to walk so slowly is a complete and utter mystery to me - I walked with our youngest daughter, and tried to stay at the back to avoid leaving everybody behind, but time and time again we found ourselves in front, with nobody in sight behind us. It became a running joke.

We filled our pockets with acorns along the way - with plans to plant them all over the garden. If there's anybody here in perhaps two hundred years time, they might wonder where the hell all the oak trees came from.

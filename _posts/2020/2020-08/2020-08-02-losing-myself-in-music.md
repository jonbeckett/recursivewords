It's the final night of my staycation. I return to work in the morning - if you can call it returning. I'll be sitting in the same chair I'm sitting in now, in the same room - just with a different computer in front of me.

I didn't go running much during the staycation. I didn't read any books. I didn't do a lot of things.

It's weird - bringing yourself back up to speed after slowing down for so long. I wouldn't say there's really a fear of what I might walk into tomorrow, but there's certainly a good amount of trepidation. I'm trying not to think too much about it - I have at least a couple of hours left to bury my head in the sand.

I'm thinking a couple of hours losing myself in Spotify might help somehow. I deleted all of my playlists some time ago - thinking it was time to discover something new - to stop living in a 1980s bubble. I'm thinking it might be time to visit again though - to listen to the music that made me who I am, and probably continues to do so.

Heart, Duran Duran, Spandau Ballet, Nik Kershaw, Howard Jones, Starship, John Parr, Mr Mister, Wang Chung, REO Speedwagon, Journey, Thompson Twins, Go West, Rush, Thomas Dolby, OMD, Tears for Fears, Simple Minds, Peter Gabriel, Ultravox... the list goes on.

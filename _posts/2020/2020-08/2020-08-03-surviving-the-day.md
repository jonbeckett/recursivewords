I started the day with an empty page in my bullet journal, and filled it with tasks as the day went on - the kinds of things you would expect after being out of the loop for a couple of weeks - timesheets to fill out, documents to read, emails to reply to, calls to make.

I admitted to somebody towards the end of the day that I really hadn't been looking forward to returning, and couldn't really explain why. I suppose I had grown used to the slower pace of life - it turns out sitting on your arse all day and getting nothing much done is strangely addictive.

I talked to my other half this evening about feeling trapped - stuck in a job that I don't always like as much as I once did, but having no exit route. I pay the majority of the bills. I keep a roof over our head. I can't take chances.

Anyway.

I've already promised myself to go for a run before work in the morning. Another step back towards normality. I'll have to get back on the bike again soon too - perhaps alternate running and cycling each day.

I survived the day. It wasn't as bad as I thought it might be. I got over myself. Go me. I'm now sitting in the dark of the study, wondering about heading to bed soon, listening to Cutting Crew on Spotify. Every time I hear it now, I think of the scene in LEGO Batman when Bruce Wayne meets Barbara Gordon for the first time.

Today was difficult. The design of something I have been working through for the last few days got ripped out from under my feet, and changed - causing a lot of re-work. I guess this is the reality of not wearing all the hats on a project. Not fun.

Anyway - I'm not supposed to write about work. It's probably unprofessional. I need to learn about not being the project owner, and letting go - not worrying about timescales, deadlines, budgets, and outcomes. All I can really do is my best.

It took three (small) glasses of wine this evening to realise that all I can do is my best.

I'm now sitting in the junk room listening to loud music, and writing this. While writing, I'm downloading a load of music to put on the music system I inherited from our daughters. They are all decorating their rooms, which means I inherit everything they no longer want. I wonder if they'll realise at some point that a music system sounds FAR better than a mobile phone ?

After I write this I'm going to get into a pretend aeroplane, and go for a fly. It helps take my mind off things.

I wonder if we have any chocolate anywhere? And I wonder how far I might run in the morning ?

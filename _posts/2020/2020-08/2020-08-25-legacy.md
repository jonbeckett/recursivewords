I don't think it's any secret that I've been struggling to post anything worthwhile to the blog for the last six months or so. You might think after nearly eighteen years writing online that I would have this whole thing figured out - that I might be able to turn the tap on, and words flow out.

I used to write so easily about anything and everything. Quite often I would write about nothing at all. I even wrote about writing about nothing at all.

The main thing that keeps me writing these days is the legacy of eighteen years worth of writing sliding down the hillside behind me. It would be a shame to stop now, with this huge unfinished story stretched out behind me. Sure, it might not be about much, but it's mine. I did this. I wrote this.

None of this will make any sense of course - seventeen years worth of it are stored in a Google Drive folder - you can't read the great majority of it. I sometimes delve into the past, and read a few old posts - smiling at how candid and open I used to be.

I sometimes wonder if that guy will show up again.

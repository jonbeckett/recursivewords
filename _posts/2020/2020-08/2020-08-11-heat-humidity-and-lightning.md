I just looked on the weather app built into Windows 10 - because of course I can't just look out the window. In the interests of accuracy, it's 11pm and the temperature is still nearly 30C. Humidity is above 50%. Lightning keeps rolling across the sky, but no thunder yet. I have a fan blowing into the room, but all it's really doing is replicating a fan oven - making sure I cook evenly. I also have an incense burner filling the room with smoke, mostly to try and persuade flies that they will die if they come anywhere near me - the smell is really a secondary requirement.

I'm sitting in the dark, while Spotify plays 'my' playlist - the stream of go-to 80s tunes that kind of form the Forrest Gump soundtrack to my life, thoughts, and day-dreams. At the moment Christopher Cross is singing 'Sailing'. Elton will follow him in a few minutes - something about Mona Lisa's and Mad Hatters.

I'm wondering about staying up all night watching a movie. It's too hot to sleep. I wonder if I can find the bootleg version of 'Almost Famous' anywhere ? Did you know there are at least three versions of that movie? The Bootleg version adds about half an hour to the cinematic version, and then there's *another* version - more of a Director's Cut - that adds another chunk on - turning an already long movie into a wonderful musical marathon through some of the best songs ever to grace a movie soundtrack.

I think the incense has burned out - how long until the flies start arriving?

It's been over a week since I last went for a run. It's just been too damn hot. They said something on the news earlier that it's the hottest run of consecutive days since records began - and doesn't look like getting any better for at least a week. I had been entertaining thoughts of running at 6am, but woke this morning before that and it was already 30C, with clear blue skies and no wind. Madness.

I'm still losing weight though - mostly through not eating junk. That being said, I just made myself marmite on toast for supper. The choice might have had something to do with there being nothing else that was easy and fast to make. I need to buy some more cereals in the morning.

I feel a bit like a small cog in an enormous machine at the moment - going round and round, slowly becoming worn, and not going anywhere. I'm sure that's a metaphor for something or other, but can't be bothered to connect the dots.

After a spectacular thunderstorm last night, the temperature has finally dropped, bringing an end to the run of hot humid days. Shortly after the sky lit up and the clouds crashed towards the ground, one of our cats ran off into the darkness. We kept the door open for some time, but suspect he has a variety of places where he hides from the world. He re-appeared this morning - sitting in the middle of the kitchen, patiently waiting for somebody to fill his food bowl.

Our other cat - the massive ginger tabby - hid inside the back of the sofa. He's always been scared of thunder and lightning. I didn't even know he could still fit through the gap in the stitching.

We didn't get to bed until perhaps 2am, and then of course I had to get up for work this morning. At least the commute is short at the moment... about five yards from the bathroom, and ten yards from the kitchen.

I'm not entirely sure how I got through the day. Perhaps an early night would be a good idea. We know I'm going to still be here, noodling around with the computer at midnight though, don't we.

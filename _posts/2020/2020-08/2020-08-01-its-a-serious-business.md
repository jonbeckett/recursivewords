Somehow it's already the first of August. How the hell did that happen? You know how you're about to step in a huge dog turd, and you notice at the last moment, and do an enormous step? It feels like the world did that between February and August.

For the first few months of lock-down, we saved SO much money - thousands - and then of course the cat got sick, and wiped out his own insurance, and all of our savings. I guess I can look back at the last few months and realise that I'm lighter and fitter than I was - although I haven't run for the last few days. I really need to get out tomorrow morning for a run.

Today I seem to have the beginnings of a cold. I'm crossing my fingers that it isn't. I'm wondering if it's down to a friend visiting unannounced yesterday afternoon. Our entire house has been in lock-down since February, with only two small groups of friends, and my in-laws visiting throughout (and even then, they were all outside). Yesterday a friend visited, and sat in the lounge with the rest of the family, completely ignoring any sort of social distancing. I made myself immediately scarce, because I didn't want to have the awkward 'um, what they hell?' conversation.

Lots of hot tea, and an early night ahead for me.

In other news, we started watching 'The Umbrella Academy' the other night - and even after one episode, I began thinking 'here we go - another comic book story where the world is supposed to end, except they'll save it just in time, and fight with each other along the way'. There's a part of me that longs for a Star Trek episode where they crew meet something in the first five minutes of the episode that completely and utterly wipes them out, and the series ends, right there. The galactic version of the Spanish encountering the Mayans. That's a bit dark, isn't it.

I ended up re-watching the first few episodes of 'Halt and Catch Fire' late last night - to remind myself just how good it was. I might have to go back and watch Mr Robot too - although once the suspense and misdirection has gone, a lot of it's draw will be removed.

I'm still bitter that 'The OA' got cancelled.

Over the past few weeks - while not blogging - I've carried on with the flight simulation idiocy. I'm a pretty proficient pretend Boeing and Airbus pilot now. I have no doubt these skills will come into play one day while travelling with work, as a gorgeous, panic stricken air hostess runs down the aircraft and asks 'DOES ANYBODY KNOW HOW TO FLY A COMMERCIAL JET?'. I'm not sure if I'll be able to do it while shaking like a leaf, with pee in my shoes though.

Now if you'll excuse me, I have more tea to drink. It's a serious business, this tea drinking lark.

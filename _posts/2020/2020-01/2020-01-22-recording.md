I spent much of this evening recording and editing the next episode of the podcast. I used "Cakewalk" for the first time, using all the lessons learned so far about mixing tracks, volume levels, fiddling with graphic equalisers, and so on. If I do my job well, you won't notice I've done it.

While the episode is ready to go, I'm going to hold it back until the weekend. I've kind of committed myself to releasing episodes on Saturdays - although I'm already thinking about sneaking it out on Friday night, to give Spotify, iTunes, and TuneIn time to update their listings.

Anyway. Somehow it's already midnight. Time for a cup of tea, and then bedtime.

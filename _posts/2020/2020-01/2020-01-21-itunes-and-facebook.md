In-between picking away at change requests for the colossal business automation project I have been working on for the last several years, I have submitted the podcast to iTunes, and created a page at Facebook.

I'm not entirely sure I know what I'm doing.

The iTunes decision was an easy one - given that 50% of America supposedly use Apple products of some description. Quite how they afford them is something of a mystery to me. After wracking my brains to remember iCloud credentials, the little podcast that could was sent off to the ivory tower in my imagination for somebody to decide if it is worthy or not.

According to a google search or two, I have between three and ten days to eat all of my finger nails.

Creating a Facebook page for the podcast seemed like an obvious decision, but also a slippery slope. While inviting people to the page, I wondered how many of them know each other by their real names - and if that might introduce a stumbling block of sorts. I know a number of people that keep their blogs firmly under lock and key - wrapped in pseudonyms, and passwords. I wonder if they will keep the podcast at the end of a very long stick, even if they appear on it at some point ?

I'm also aware that adding all of these bits of periphery around the podcast means I have more workflow to churn through after recording episodes - updating Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, and so on. I suppose I'll just have to get used to that. Thankfully Spotify and iTunes will update themselves.

Anyway. The Facebook page is up. If you've not visited it yet, head to the following link, and click the like button:

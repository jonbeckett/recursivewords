After the craziness of work, home, and idiotic escapades such as the podcast in recent days, I'm finally slowing down. There had been plans to visit a hobby store with Miss 19 this morning - which went out of the window when she didn't emerge until a little before lunchtime. There had also been plans for Miss 16 to take part in a hockey match this afternoon - an email arrived moments ago informing us that the pitch is frozen.

Suddenly the afternoon has opened up before us, and we are relaxing into it with no plans whatsoever. A few hours of terrible television shows, internet surfing, and reading are probably just what the doctor ordered.

Now if you'll excuse me, I have all sorts of very important nothing to get on with.

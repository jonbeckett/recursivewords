I saw a quote on Facebook a few days ago, commenting that once you get past a certain age, finding out what aches or pains you might have each day is something of a lottery. I laughed at the time, and scrolled past.

I really should have taken more notice.

While emptying the dishwasher at home last night, I felt a pain go up my left leg, through my backside, and into the small of my back. How does that even happen? For the rest of the evening I kept forgetting, and then wincing as the pain returned.

Today, while sitting at my desk in the office, my left foot started hurting - for no reason at all. It just started hurting. I stood up, walked around the office, and flexed my foot around - which seemed to resolve matters for a while.

I'm wondering which random part of my body will cease functioning next. Perhaps this will be the pattern for the rest of my life - semi-anxiously waiting for aches and pains to appear. At least it will give me something to talk about when I bump into acquaintances though - I'll be able to regale them of all of my aches and pains, and they'll wish they hadn't asked. I'll enjoy that.

It's starting to get interesting - this whole self isolation lark. While I seem to have taken to it like a duck to water, that can't be said for everybody. I read a news story this morning that an elderly man had murdered his wife, after being shut in the house with her for the last three weeks. I know it shouldn't be funny, but I couldn't help grinning - and then felt awful about finding it funny.

I haven't left the house for some days. The last adventure was to the supermarket with my other half - a grocery gathering mission. Apparently the rules have tightened since - with only one adult household member being allowed to go shopping now. I'm guessing that means I won't be allowed to go - because I'll come back with all manner of things we didn't really need. I would of course argue that chocolate spread, cookies, and wine are essentials.

The children haven't left the confines of the house and garden for weeks. They seem happy enough - talking to friends through the wonders of the internet, playing games in the garden, and doing schoolwork set by their respective teachers.

I suspect if the internet router dies, there will be a riot.

My other half continues to work at the infant school, although on a vastly reduced schedule. On the days she visits the school, she returns home, drops her shoes into a bucket of disinfectant, and strips into the washing machine before getting in the shower. Thankfully she is working from home for the rest of this week - building out the new school website.

The new bicycle I bought for the commute to work sits in the shed - probably wondering what it did wrong. Was it something it said? Something it did? While not riding it I have been doing no fitness related activities at all. I daren't get on the scales. I can't imagine cutting my hair off last week will have made more than a few grams difference. The chocolate spread on toast and bacon sandwiches probably have.

We're out of bacon now.

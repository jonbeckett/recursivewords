After waking up a little after 8am this morning I was very busy daydreaming when my other half rolled over, woken by the cat asking for his breakfast, and murmured:

"Are you not going for a run this morning?"

I sighed. For some reason I woke up with little or no enthusiasm this morning. After wondering about maybe going running tomorrow instead, some unseen force scaped me out of bed, gathered together some shorts and a t-shirt, and delivered me to the bottom of the stairs.

Miss 15 leaned around the corner of the kitchen doorway, bowls of cat food in her hands.

"Shall we go for a run then?"

She shrugged - "I suppose?"

Five minutes later we found ourselves doing warm-up exercises in the warm morning sunshine outside the house, and then set-off through town. While running, it occurred to me that I don't have to make conversation with my youngest daughter while running - she's the polar opposite of her older sister. With Miss 19 I have to keep a continual stream of nonsensical conversation to take her mind off what she's doing - with 15, I don't have to do anything - just be there with her.

We ran eight sets of three minutes this morning. She sniffed throughout the entire run - I imagine heyfever. The sun has caused everything green to burst into life over the past few weeks - suddenly the air is thick with pollen and insects, even in the morning.

After the run we took turns through the shower, and then made a late breakfast. She cooked pancakes, while I cooked bacon. Of course I say "she cooked pancakes" - it was more a case of she made the mixture, massacred the first pancake, and then I cooked the pancakes and the bacon.

It's now almost lunchtime, and I'm not entirely sure what I might fill the afternoon with. It has already been suggested to me that I might spend some time with our eldest, but she just printed out a recipe to make sushi. Ah - so I'll be cleaning up an unholy mess in the kitchen later then.

Coffee. That's what I'll do first.

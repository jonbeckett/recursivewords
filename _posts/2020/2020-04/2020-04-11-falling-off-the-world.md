Two factors have contributed to my recent disappearance from the internet at large. The first was the rather foolish decision to celebrate the bank holiday weekend by buying a new game for myself and my eldest daughter to play - an endlessly deep, absorbing game called "No Man's Sky".

The second factor - this evening at least - was the sudden realisation late in the evening that I had not recorded a podcast this week.

If you were not aware, I've been recording a regular podcast for the last several months, talking to bloggers all over the world about their blogging journey - how they got started, what they write about - that kind of thing. It's really just a relaxed conversation for anwhere from half an hour to an hour, where they get to tell their story.

So yes. Tonight I figured out that it takes about two hours from end-to-end. I called up a friend via voice-chat on Facebook, and we started recording straight away.

Note to self - don't use Facebook voice chat again - it blew up on us twice - "cylon-ing" (where the latency or whatever starts to make everybody sound like robots).

Anyway. I need to get some sleep. I promise to write a half-decent blog post tomorrow - a catch up on daily life, if you will.

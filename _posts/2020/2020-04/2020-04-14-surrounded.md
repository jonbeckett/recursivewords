After Miss 19 asked if I would be using the study/junk room to work in this week, I ran around the house like a madman this morning, making way to use the living room as temporary office. It didn't help that the kitchen, lounge, and hallway were trashed, but I somehow managed to clear everything before collapsing at the table and switching on my webcam in time for the daily company-wide catch-up session.

I'm wearing a shirt today. I've decided to actually put some effort in while working from home - to make it feel more like I'm at work - if that makes any sense. I always have a shower and brush my teeth when I get up, but I've been sitting in the study on work days in t-shirts and cargo pants. Granted, that's what I usually wear to work, but I don't know - if I do nothing different at all on work days, every day feels like the last. The only reason I usually put a shirt on is if I'm going on-site, or if a client is visiting the office.

I do wonder how many businesses will change the way they work after this self-isolation adventure - how many will realise they don't need an office, and they don't need to travel for meetings. I remember back when I used to do freelance web development work, I hardly ever met the client - they just sent me a brief, we might have a chat about it, and then I would just get on with it.

The youger girls arrived in the lounge late this morning - I asked if they might tidy their rooms up today - to cheer their Mum up when she returns later (she's at work). They're getting on with *something* upstairs - I'm not entirely sure *what* they are getting on with. Let's keep our fingers crossed, and hope they are not just jamming everything into the back of their wardrobes.

You're probably wondering why I have titled today's post 'Surrounded' - that will be because I am surrounded with bunting and inflatable messages from my youngest daughter's birthday yesterday. I still can't believe she's 15.

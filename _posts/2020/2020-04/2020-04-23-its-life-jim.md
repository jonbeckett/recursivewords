It's been a day. After pulling the design together for a future project this morning, I wandered into the garden to find my other half sitting in a camping chair outside, hiding from the children, who were arguing about chores.

The chore argument was entirely predictable. A reward system had been introduced - you know - like you might have for 7 year olds - except our younger kids are 15 and 16. I was quite impressed with how quickly Miss 16 figured out how to take advantage and try to cherry pick the chores she was willing to do (mostly driven by laziness).

Rather than work through lunch once again, I decided to spend an hour in the garden, and got most of the grass at the back of the house cut. It still looked like hell, but better than it was. I spent another half an hour out there after work - it almost doesn't look like jungle now.

We finally let Miss 15 join Tiktok this evening. She has been asking for months, and most of her friends have it. I'm just hoping we have done the right thing. I guess it's time to start having some trust in her. I don't think I've ever seen her quite so happy.

I'm running again in the morning, and then helping my youngest daughter call a journalist and ask about her work as part of a school project. I imagine she will talk on one phone, and I'll record it on another - so she can go back through it afterwards.

This evening I may fall back into the clutches of 'No Mans Sky'. It's a ridiculously addictive video game where you get dumped on a distant planet, and have to MacGuyver your way off it, and then set out across the universe.

Or maybe I should go read a book, or watch a movie. Actually, something rubbish to eat, something nice to drink, and a terrible movie sounds quite persuasive.

This has been a very random post, hasn't it.

p.s. I might have re-acquired the [jonbeckett.blog](https://jonbeckett.blog) domain name this evening, and attached it to the Wordpress account. Does this mean I'm eventually headed back to Wordpress? Perhaps. Very slowly though.

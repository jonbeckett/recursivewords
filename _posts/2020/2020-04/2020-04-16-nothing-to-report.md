Nothing spectacular happened today. The world turned once upon it's axis, it didn't rain, and I had cheese and pickle sandwiches for lunch.

Another day ticked off the calendar. Another day sitting in front of the computer. Another day answering emails. Another day gazing at code, trying to make head or tail of it.

I'm not working tomorrow, so was hoping to go out for a run first thing. I made the mistake of mentioning it at the dinner table tonight, so now I'm taking my daughters too. I have been instructed to put them through the 'Couch to 5K' programme - at least it will mean we get out of the house every few days.

I haven't done anything to do with fitness for weeks, so it will be interesting to see how I go. The first few weeks are pretty easy as far as I remember - running for two minutes, and walking for 1 minute - and repeating for half an hour. I guess I need to find the mobile app that does the timings.

Anyway. Time for an early night. I keep promising myself early nights, and then suddenly it's the early hours of the morning.

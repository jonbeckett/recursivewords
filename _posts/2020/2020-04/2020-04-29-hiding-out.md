I'm hiding out in the lounge. My other half has taken over the junk room (where the big computer lives), and is trying to cut together a video for the infant school with each of the staff members singing and dancing along to a pre-agreed music track, along with their children.

She started learning how to use the video editing software half an hour ago. The kind of video editing software you might use to make a movie. It doesn't help that everybody's video has been uploaded to a shared drive in portrait, landscape, with borders, without borders... so yeah - she's going to have to rotate each clip, scale each clip, cut each clip, and re-assemble the various clips - all while keeping it in time with a backing music track.

It's going to take hours. Especially as she's learning as she goes. The only piece of advice I gave before running from the room in fear of my life was to use a parallel video channel to edit clips, and drop them into the "real" timeline after they looked ok.

I might not know a lot, but I've learned enough through doing the podcast to know how not to mess up everything you've already done in a huge hurry. I've already warned my other half that after an hour doing this, she knows more about video editing than anybody we know, and will be roped into editing videos for everybody over the next however many years.

My late father in law taught me an invaluable life lesson - never, ever be good at anything that anybody else needs somebody to be good at. I laughed when he first told me, but over the years I've learned through bitter experience that he was absolutely right. If you have a sought after skill, keep a damn good lid on it.

I suppose some people can't hide their skills really. Take Gordon Ramsay, for instance - I wonder if his neighbours ever call up, asking "I've bought some bacon but have no clue how to wrap it round the chicken - can you spare a few minutes?".

In recent years, the only time I've broken cover was to help a friend with her website. The site was pretty badly borked, and the person that usually looks after it was at a loss too. Within an hour I had rescued it from the fire, hacked my way through the back end, re-set passwords throughout, run updates, and handed her the keys to her shiny new online house. Here's the thing though - she didn't take advantage.

I love people that don't take advantage. Unfortunately they seem to be in the minority. Some people's entire existence seems to centre around taking what they can from others - exploiting, and using. Their lack of tact, empathy, guilt, or shame always amazes me.

Anyway!

I'm having a wonderful time sitting here in the quiet - eating chocolate biscuits, drinking coffee (I already had two glasses of wine), and half watching ridiculous TV shows on Netflix. Joel McHale keeps trying to talk me into binge-watching his show, but I've already promised to watch the second part of Dracula with my daughter.

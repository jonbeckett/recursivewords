She is one of the luminaries that helped forge the idea of posting an online diary or journal into the collective consciousness. If you were reading and writing blog posts in the mid 2000s, back when blogging started to become more mainstream, you might have followed any of a number of online journals - among them Dooce, written by Heather Armstrong, Belle du Jour, written by Brooke Magnanti, or Petite Angaise, written by a british girl living in Paris called Catherine Sanderson.

Of course back then we didn't know the author's names - shielded in wonderful anonymity, we knew only the name of their blogs.

I still can't quite believe I'm writing this.

This week I had the opportunity to talk to Catherine Sanderson - to recount the story of how "Petite Anglaise" came to be, what happens when a blog becomes famous, how you go about turning a blog into a book, and why we know Catherine's name.

For the last few days I have been tidying up some old "think pieces", and re-posting them to a shiny new blog at [jonbeckett.com](https://jonbeckett.com). I'm not posting them here, because I think of this more as a diary - a journal. The new place just has essays.

The reason behind all of this is because the company I work for has started investing a bit more effort in their web presence - they are playing the SEO game, and trying to attract a few more eyeballs into what we do, and who we are. Along the way it hasn't gone unnoticed that I can string words together when I put my mind to it. I will freely admit that if this leads to writing becoming a regular part of my job, I might smile rather a lot.

So - while posting to my own site, it occurred to me that the best way of letting the world know my words exist would be to syndicate the posts to somewhere else - to take the words to the people - so I've been cross-posting to [Medium](https://jonbeckett.medium.com). If you're not familiar with Medium, it's a social publishing platform founded by Ev Williams - one of the original founders of Twitter.

Anyway.

This evening something rather unexpected happened. The owner of a publication at Medium with three quarters of a million followers asked if they might syndicate a couple of my posts.

I of course said yes.

I'll let you know what happens next.

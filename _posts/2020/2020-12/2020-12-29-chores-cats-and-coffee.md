For the first several hours today I was the only person up and about - wandering from room to room, doing this and that. Completing some chores, starting others. By the time anybody else showed their face the washing up was done, the washing machine busy with a second load, the air dryer (a rather fantastic invention that dries clothes) re-filled with freshly washed clothes, the kitchen cleaned, the clothes rails folded up and put away, towels folded and put away. You get the idea - it's pretty much endless around here.

I constructed an hour to sit in the relative quiet of the study and wrote a few words for the other blog about procrastination - feel free to [go have a read](https://jonbeckett.com/writing-teaches-procrastination/) - if you're feeling snarky it might make you smile. The other blog gets cross-posted into Medium - where I have now made enough money to pay for the account for over a year.

I feel like I should be more enthused that people are choosing to like some of the words I have written, and that it's earning me a little bit of money. It feels somehow false though - constructing posts about this or that, purely because I think others might be interested in a given perspective or story. I suppose it's no different than writing here though.

In other news, we watched Cats last night - the musical movie based on the famous theatre production. While I didn't think it was quite as awful as the movie critics suggested, I didn't think it was great either. The quality of the singers, and the production of the music let the entire movie down - if they had been stellar, nobody would have looked twice at the oddly erotic cats. I can't help comparing it against the likes of Moulin Rouge, which knocked every musical before it out of the park.

Tonight's "family movie" is "Home Alone" - picked at random from a home-made tombola, filled with folded pieces of paper. We submitted five movies each - none of mine have come out yet. I'm beginning to suspect the entire thing is rigged.

Now if you'll excuse me, I have another cup of coffee to go make. I made one a few minutes earlier, but then started writing this entirely forgettable screed, and forgot all about it. Luke warm coffee sucks.

After sliding out of bed a little after 7am this morning, I wandered downstairs and dressed myself as Santa. Father Christmas. Saint Nicholas. Only a very low budget version - with a wonderful red suit that might rip in half if you bend over too quickly.

Ten minutes later two very sleepy daughters joined me in the kitchen and began dressing as mini-Santas to accompany me on a mad-cap escapade around town. Normally at this time of year you might find several thousand Santas running an organised route to raise money for charity - this morning it was just us.

I took a bit of a risk in wearing nothing but underwear and a t-shirt under the Santa suit. After the ass-ripping antics of last year, my other half questioned the choice. I grinned and shrugged. I didn't figure on continual rain turning the already thin material into tissue paper en-route.

Along the way we received cheers from construction workers, beeps from delivery vans, and waves from people on foot. It was almost enough to keep my middle daughter running. Let's just say she's never going to find running easy - partly because of her build, but mostly because she gives up so easily. I've never known anybody with so little will power.

My youngest daughter ran the entire route at a canter - often doubling back with me and encouraging her sister. She also ran a final lap around the green where we live with me - making sure we covered 5K. Neighbours waved from windows as we passed.

So - it is done - the Santa Fun Run is completed for another year.

Good riddance.

Now where are the three ghosts that were foretold?

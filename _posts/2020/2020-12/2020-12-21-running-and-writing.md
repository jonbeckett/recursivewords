I'm supposed to get up at 8am tomorrow morning and run around town in a Santa suit, accompanied by my younger daughters. I'm not quite sure how they're going to do it given that they have not taken part in any activities you might describe as helping their fitness for weeks.

I'm starting to wonder if this is what growing up is all about - getting up and doing things you don't really want to do, because somebody asked you to. It's a bloody stupid idea really - running around dressed as Santa. I imagine it will give a few people a laugh around town.

If I wasn't running (read:walking) with my daughters I imagine I would be home within half an hour - I can't see us getting home inside an hour.

I was going to have a night off from writing tonight, but then something clicked in my head, and I spent the last two hours churning out another post for the other blog. It's been cross posted to Medium, where I'm slowly but surely making money now. Let's hope I don't run out of things to write about any time soon.

It turns out it's quite difficult to write after two glasses of wine. I'm wondering how Hemingway did it - I'm beginning to suspect the stories of drunken excess are lies.

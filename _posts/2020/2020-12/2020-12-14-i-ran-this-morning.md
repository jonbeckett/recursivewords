I ran this morning. After suggesting to Miss 16 that I could accompany her, I got up at 7am, pulled my shorts and shoes on, and was ready to go within minutes. I called up the stairs after her, and heard a murmur.

"I don't want to go"

After quite some cajoling, and trying not to completely and utterly lose my shit with her, she got up, got dressed, and joined me outside.

I am continually amazed at how easily teenagers give up at anything that requires any will power, determination, effort, or hard work. It was SUCH hard work - trying to encourage her throughout the second half of the (shortened) route we eventually completed. I'm trying to talk her equally unfit sisters to run with her instead of me - because my encouragement is eventually seen as "going on".

Anyway.

It's nearly midnight again. How does that keep happening?

I started the day sitting in the lounge today - opposite my youngest daughter, who is doing schoolwork via Microsoft Teams for the remainder of term. She lasted an hour before vanishing off through the house. At lunchtime I switched back to sitting in the junk room on my own - given that it made very little difference which room I should sit in on my own.

This wasn't a very exciting post, was it. Perhaps tomorrow will be better.

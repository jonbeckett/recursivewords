When you look at the clock and it's a few minutes until midnight, does midnight count as today, or tomorrow ? Asking for a friend.

I've done very little today - unless you count my exploits in "The Sims", where I built a new house, furnished it, moved in, made friends, got married, and had unimaginable quantities of "Woohoo". I can still remember when The Sims first came out - I had recently started going out with my other half, and she would come to visit at the weekend and spend hours looking after a little computerised version of us. I seem to remember her not being impressed when I moved in several fit lifeguards next door - one of which burned herself to death on the cooker while trying to fry an egg. Her housemates stood screaming instead of calling for the emergency services.

I have been writing. I'm still experimenting with Medium - the publishing site I was playing with earlier in the week - figuring out how it works. I will admit to enjoying posting a few bits and pieces that are more about what I know, than what I've been doing - although the temptation to start telling stories is strong.

Now if you'll excuse me, I have a book to go read in bed. I'm still reading "The Queen's Gambit" by Walter Tevis - the book the Netflix series was based upon. It's very good.

Has it really been a week since the last blog post? You would think the absence of pretty much anything from me over the last few days would mean an impending avalanche of thoughts, ideas, stories, and idiocy. The truth? I'm coming up blank.

I'm back working full-time now, although still working from home. I'm just taking a bit of a break to write this. It's funny - as my world slowly returns to normal, I'm starting to realise how much we used to cram into each day - before the whole lockdown thing started. Every day was a sprint, filled with chaos and mayhem. I'm not sure I want to go back to that world now.

I finally got around to booking some holiday yesterday. Although I have been incredibly fortunate to carry on working throughout the pandemic, I looked at the calendar and realised I had only taken a few days off since the start of the year. Even though we're not going anywhere or doing anything, it will be good to spend some time at home with the kids - to go on walks together, and maybe even start running again.

My foot is slowly healing. If you haven't read previous posts, I managed to break a toe on my left foot a few weeks ago. There really isn't anything you can do for broken toes, other than tape them up, and be careful. I'm now into the third week of it healing, and can walk on it without too much pain. I think another couple of weeks and I can try running on it.

I'm still losing weight. I know! I'm as surprised as anybody else. I suppose the main motivation is how annoyed I will be if I gain any weight. For the last month I have dropped one or two pounds every week - purely by not eating snacks between meals, and making sure meals are not ridiculous. According to the NHS body mass index calculator online (which I just looked at), I'm at the high end of the healthy weight range - I need to lose about another 14 pounds. Hopefully by the time my vacation starts, I'll be getting close to that.

I drank a glass of wine the night before last - the first in several months. Oh my word - it went straight to my head. I actually wondered after drinking it if it's really worth it - alcohol. There were things I wanted to get on with (I drank it with dinner), and was conscious it was affecting me.

I'm still playing with the aircraft simulator. I did a flight last night with my Dad and his group of friends - taking off from the mountains of Switzerland, and landing at London City airport. It was fun. I still need to study air traffic control procedures (hence the annoyance about wine having an effect), but I'm getting there slowly. My other half thinks the entire escapade is entirely pointless, and feigns a comical level of indifference if I ever mention anything to do with it. She's probably right, but it keeps me out of mischief.

Oh - just remembered - the Eurovision movie.

We finally got around to watching the Eurovision movie earlier in the week - a day after everybody else went mad about it. We absolutely loved everything about it. I don't want to go on and on about it, because you can go watch it yourself if you haven't already - I will submit that I've been listening to the soundtrack album on Spotify all week though :)

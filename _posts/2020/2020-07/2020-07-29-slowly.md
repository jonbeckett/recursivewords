I started writing this post a little after 8am this morning, and then a world of chores, distractions, and errands took over. It's Wednesday - half-way through my second week off. I would say I'm starting to look forwards to going back to work, but of course that's not happening, because I work from home now. Next monday I'll be sitting at the same chair, in front of the same desk - just with a different laptop in front of me.

We're heading out again today - to walk around the same place we walked around last week - a National Trust property a few miles from home. I imagine the fresh air will do us some good. My mother-in-law is coming with us - she's due to arrive in the next half an hour or so.

I didn't go running this morning. I haven't done a lot of things recently. I'm not really sure why. Maybe this is me slowing down (that's if slowing down discounts washing clothes, dishes, putting things away, tidying up behind people, putting garbage out, and so on, and so on, and so on). I realised yesterday that I haven't been out on my bike - you know, the shiny new bike I bought just before lockdown - for weeks.

Anyway... time to go. I'll write more later. Maybe.

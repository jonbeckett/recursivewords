After a month keeping off a very broken toe, I finally got out running again this evening - although perhaps 'running' is an exaggeration - more of a gentle jog. I jumped back into the Couch to 5K plan with my daughters, who have advanced all of 1 week since I last ran with them a month ago. The stunning lack of will-power in teenagers astounds me.

I'm so pleased my foot was alright. Strangely, walking hurts more than running. I can finally continue on the path to getting fit once again - and given that I now work from home, it's become quite a bit more important than it was to at least do *something* each day.

If I get through this week without any secondary injuries showing up, I'm going to start extending the distance out while I'm off work over the next few weeks. It's tempting to set goals already, but I really should just see how it goes - see how it feels each day.

Smiling like an idiot this evening.

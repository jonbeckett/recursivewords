I visited the office yesterday - for the first time in four months. A flying visit to empty my desk, and collect a monitor and an office chair. The company I work for is finally following the example set by the likes of Automattic, and doing away with the office entirely - at least for the moment.

The convergence of ubiquitous fast internet connections, Office 365, Microsoft Teams, and the Corona Virus opened everybody's eyes to the realisation that we were able to carry on operating very much normally while working from home. I imagine the focus of the management naturally turned to the office, and the question 'why do we have an office?'.

I now have a *much* better chair in the junk room at home.

I imagine in time the company may end up hiring somewhere more suited to meetings - and we will perhaps gather every few months - mostly to remember what we all look like. While in lockdown I have been the instigator of several 'Zoom Quizzes' - open to all staff, and their families. The next quiz happens in a couple of weeks time. After we all emerge from lockdown, I imagine the quizzes might turn into group meals - picking local bars or restaurants to catch up with each other.

It seems strange to think I'm not working in an office any more. I've been sitting at a desk most weekdays for the last twenty five years. I suppose I still will - just not in an office. There are already murmurings at home about finally decorating the junk room. If I have to sit here all day every day, it would be nice if it was a little more habitable.

I better turn running and cycling into a much more regular thing too - if I'm not cycling to work and back every day, my backside will develop its own gravity.

In other news, my middle daughter has started studying to become an air traffic controller. It's surprised all of us. Since discovering the entire damn fool escapade while accompanying me on a virtual flight on the simulator, something switched on in the depths of her brain. She has already enrolled on a training course, and is studying books. Before long, I'll contact London Centre, and be greeted with my daughter's bossy voice, instructing me to 'maintain flight level two hundred', and to 'put the kettle on Dad'.

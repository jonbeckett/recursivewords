I have the next two weeks off work. Ten working days. Fourteen days in all. It all seems a bit giddy at the moment, although I'm mindful of a conversation with my brother-in-law earlier today, who has just had two weeks off - 'I looked forward to it for ages, and then before you know it, it's gone, and you realise you have to go back to work in the morning'.

I'm going running first thing tomorrow. I was supposed to go today, and woke up in time - but then fell asleep, and then the bed seemed warm, and comfy, and... well I just didn't get up. It's funny - while laying there, gazing at the ceiling, I quietly became annoyed with myself. I could have been up, out, running, doing chores, clearing the decks, and whatever else - instead I daydreamed, and did nothing - for nearly an hour.

Maybe I should give myself a pass from time to time. It's incredibly rare that I sit and do nothing. I'm starting to realise that this whole slow-down on the blog can mostly be explained by the world slowing down during lockdown. Suddenly there was no reason to be running here, there and everywhere to get this done, that done, and the other done. Slowing down made me realise that I didn't HAVE to do all the things I had been doing - and that included emptying my head into the blog each day.

Of course I substituted blogging for something else. Something tremendously useless in the grand scheme of things - I learned to fly a Boeing 737, and an Airbus A320 in a study-level simulator. If I'm ever sat near the flight deck of a commercial airliner in the future, and a member of the cabin crew runs down the cabin looking panic stricken, I can put my hand up. 'Yes, I can fly a pretend one of these - I've logged several tens of hours, and not crashed one yet - but there was that time I nearly froze all the pretend passengers to death after forgetting to route warm air into the cabin...'

I can even re-programme the damn route into the flight computer. Yes, I'm THAT guy.

Anyway.

Tomorrow morning I'm getting up bright and early, and going for a run around town. My eldest daughter has indicated she would like to come too. I'm not banking on it. I told her I will knock on the door in the morning, but if she doesn't emerge in her running kit by 8am, tough luck. Yes, I've become THAT Dad too.

Maybe I should blog my way through the fourteen day staycation. It will give me something to do - to distract me - to occupy my mind.

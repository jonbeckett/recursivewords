It's Monday lunchtime, and you find me sitting in the junk room at home. I've been here on weekdays since the middle of March. Nearly four months now. The only places I have visited in town during that time have been the grocery store, and the pharmacy. I've been on a few long walks (even with a broken toe), which we have dubbed 'mental health walks'.

This weekend we visited a national trust property called 'Basildon Park', and wandered around the grounds of the estate for a few hours. We took a picnic, and met my in-laws there. While walking, we viewed any and all strangers with suspicion.

Work has slowed down ever-so-slightly this week. Owing to shortened working hours, and various co-workers being furloughed, I've found my days pretty full. Busy is good though. Busy stops you looking at the world around you too much and being horrified at the ignorance, division, and idiocy going on seemingly everywhere.

I've quickly learned that it's best not to have balanced opinions about anything at the moment - there's a strong sense from the most vocal on social media platforms that if you're not with them, you are against them - there is no middle ground. Facts, opinions, truth, and lies have been stirred into a toxic stew that is fashioned into whatever narrative people wish to subscribe to or promote. It doesn't help that 'defence of self' is such a strong instinct in the wilfully ignorant.

Anyway.

I'm listening to the 'Mellow Morning' playlist on Spotify, complete with adverts every few minutes. Music has been one of the huge benefits of working from home - filling the room with an endless stream of songs and stories. I tent to pick playlists completely at random - and rarely know the names of any of the bands, artists, or tracks. If one of the kids were to walk in and ask after a track (which they will not, because it's Dad music), I typically wouldn't be able to tell them.

Time for another coffee perhaps.

*p.s. I cut all my hair off again.*

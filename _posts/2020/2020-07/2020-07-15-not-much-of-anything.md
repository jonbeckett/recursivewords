You find me sitting in the dark of the junk room, trying to switch off at the end of the day. I'm listening to a Carly Simon album, and typing into a minimalist online editor. I sometimes find it difficult to switch off - it's difficult to stop thinking.

It doesn't help that with a few days of work left until my vacation, I'm buried in thousands of lines of source code for a new project at work. I need to get it to a "good place" before downing tools on Friday - and I'm not entirely sure how that's going to happen at the moment.

Of course I'm not really going on a vacation - I'm not going anywhere - it's more a "staycation". I'll promise to read books, watch movies, and lots of other things - and I'll do none of it. I will go running though, and I will go for long walks. Long walks help with the thoughts.

I must remember to take a notebook on the long walks. I often think of things to write about while out on my own, but almost always misplace the idea before reaching a keyboard.

I often solve computer programming problems while in the bathroom. How does that even work ?

In other news, I made it out for another run this morning. I went on my own, and just ran around town - a couple of miles. I'm still worried about the broken toe and don't want to push it too much. I tell myself that, but in reality I've lost quite a bit of fitness while sitting on my arse for the last month. To be honest I'm stunned I can still run any sort of distance.

Anyway.

It's getting late. Time to go brush my teeth, and sit in bed scrolling rubbish on a tablet instead of reading the book I purposely took upstairs to read.

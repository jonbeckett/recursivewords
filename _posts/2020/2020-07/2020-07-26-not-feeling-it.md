I got up this morning and went for a run, after not running for the last two days. I got up half an hour later than I should have, both my knees hurt when I started out, one of my feet went dead after a couple of miles, a tendon started to hurt a mile after that.

You know how you sometimes start to wonder "why am I even doing this?".

I carried on though, and called it a day a little way from home - walking the last quarter of a mile. I'm kind of glad I carried on, and also amused at my own idiocy.

I took my phone for the run and recorded it on Strava. I've realised the main benefit of Strava isn't to push me to go faster or further - it's to guilt me into not stopping, because other people will see it. 

After getting home, I dragged myself into the shower, and then got dressed. In a few minutes I'm walking back into town with my better half to get a birthday present for her Mum. She ran into the study panic-stricken last night, having forgotten her Mum's birthday. Guess who was washing up baking tins at midnight last night ?

Anyway. Remind me to get some toothpaste in town - I ran out this morning.

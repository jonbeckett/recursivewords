At dinner yesterday evening, my middle daughter put all sorts of plans in place to go running several times a week before college. I suggested I could go with her at perhaps 6:30am each morning - she suggested 6am. I rolled my eyes, and agreed.

After setting my alarm last night, and waking up at 6am, I rolled out of bed, pulled on some running shorts, and wandered over to her bedroom doorway. No response. I went downstairs, downed a glass of water, found my running shoes and coat, and got ready. Twenty minutes later, I made a final call. Still no answer.  

I left the house at 6:30am on my own.

The last few runs have only been a couple of kilometres. I took it slowly (or so I thought), and headed out across town on the route that adds up to a little of five kilometres - listening to podcasts along the way. I shook my head at the coincidences that happen to me when out running - I think Chaos mathematicians would describe me as a "strange attractor". I can be in the middle of nowhere, and not have seen a car for ages - but as soon as I need to set foot in the road, to pass a construction site, for example - cars will appear from all directions, at the precise point where the road is at it's narrowest. It happened four times in five hundred yards this morning - the final instance nearly getting me run over.

I'm trying desperately to turn running into a habit. At the moment it's still a victory of sorts for the "what you need to be doing" part of my brain over the "what you would like to be doing" part. I would like to have still been in bed. I did it though. Five and a half kilometres, with no "cheating" (no walking). Of course now I'll be tired all day, but that's a small price to pay in the good fight against having a backside the size of pluto.

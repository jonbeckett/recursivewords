I went for a run this morning. I would like to tell you that it was easy, and I felt great, and "go me!". In reality it was hard work, I felt like crap, and I nearly passed out within sight of the house on the way home.

Go me though!

After having a shower - having not done any physical exercise for nearly three weeks - I got on the scales and looked at them through the gaps between my fingers. Almost unbelievably, I have lost more weight - despite a diet of utter rubbish just recently. I ate an entire packet of chocolate cookies to myself the other day. I've been eating chocolate spread on toast for breakfast and supper, purely because we ran out of cereals, and I couldn't be bothered to go and get any more.

AND I LOST WEIGHT?!

I really don't get it.

The really odd thing about running is I quite like it. I become lost in the breathing, and the rhythm of my feet on the ground. I typically listen to podcasts while running - and become frustrated with my cheap-ass bluetooth earbuds that fall out of my ears after the first mile or two.

This morning while running I listened to "The Retro Hour", where they talked about the new Raspberry Pi computer. I want one. I don't need one, but I want one. I doubt I'll get one, because it turns out food and electricity are more important than toys.

Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to make a coffee - because who likes sleep anyway?

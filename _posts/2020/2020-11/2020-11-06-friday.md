I'm decompressing somewhat this evening, after spending the greater part of the week writing a lengthy technical document for work. I think it surprises my family sometimes - when I leave the study at the end of the work day - at how tired I can look.

Anyway. It's the weekend. Of course we can't go anywhere, because there's a lockdown going on.

Washing clothes, cooking food, washing up, reading books, watching movies, and playing retro video games. That's about the size of the weekend.

Fun times.

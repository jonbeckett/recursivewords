A few days ago I was approached at work - along with everybody else - about writing occasional blog posts for the company website. The posts will be shared with the wider world through LinkedIn - I'm guessing the company is going to start playing the social game.

My first thought was to spin up an instance of Ghost for myself (a very nice web publishing platform), post some writing to it, and then share it with the company I work for. While thinking about doing so, doubts began to emerge. If I run my own website, I need to look after it.

Instead of building something new, I walked over to [Medium](https://jonbeckett.medium.com), and posted a few words. Sure, Medium has it's detractors - mostly related to their method of monetising content - but I don't have to look after it, which is kind of huge. I'm still not sure I'm doing the right thing though.

So anyway - I'm sort of writing syndicated content all of a sudden. Alongside this almost daily head emptying routine, I'm trying to think of insightful, interesting, engaging things to say about the one thing I never talk about here - my work. I *think* it's going to be fun - certainly a good diversion for the moment.

I suppose the problem comes when the company realises I can string words together, and writing will become a part of my job - which is exactly when all the perceived "fun" will vanish without trace.

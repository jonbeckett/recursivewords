It's been a strange sort of day - proof reading documents, checking, modifying, reading again. Hopefully I'm nearing the end of the journey I've been on in recent weeks, and will soon begin looking for the next.

I can feel myself turning inwards at the moment. Not necessarily shutting myself off from the world - just stepping away from the noise for a while. Gathering my thoughts. Quietly matching the rest of the world unfold.

I took my daughters for a walk to the park yesterday morning, paid for by the promise of coffee. Little did we know our journey would become so trecherous. When will people learn about wearing face coverings, and social distancing ? You might have thought a second national lockdown would jog some sort of recognition. Apparently not.

Perhaps an hour of Mario or Sonic will help slow the cogs a little.

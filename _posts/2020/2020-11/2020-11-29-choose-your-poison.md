A few nights ago I heard a mouse running around in our attic. I'm guessing it came in from the houses alongside, and I'm guessing it's not alone.

I spent an hour delving around in the attic on Friday night, and found nothing chewed up. That doesn't mean I haven't unleashed hell on our little visitor(s).

Five poison bait traps went into the attic on Friday night after my inspection. Three of them have been nibbled at as of this morning. I have enough bait to keep re-filling them for weeks, and will buy more if needed. If they eat eat any, they are dead inside 48 hours.

We joked about constructing a route for the cats to get into the attic - my eldest daughter proposed shutting them up there, and letting nature take it's course. I think the cats already know the mice are up there - they've taken to camping out on the landing, below the loft hatch. I'm guessing they can both hear, and smell them.

If not for camping kit, and old childrens clothes being stored in the attic, I wouldn't be too worried. I really don't want all the sleeping bags chewed up though. Fingers crossed we wipe them out before anything too valuable gets damaged.

*p.s. just ordered an ultrasound deterrent, to hopefully keep them away in the longer term.*

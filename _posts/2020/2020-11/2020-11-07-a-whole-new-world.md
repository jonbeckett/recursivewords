Perhaps it says something that even half a world away, I have been unable to distract myself from the United States election for the last several days. I have family in America, and know countless others across the country. I have somehow become invested in their hopes over the last few years. They say adversity brings people closer together - perhaps that's why I have felt their hopes so keenly.

I have been watching a number of news networks throughout the week to get a balanced view, and was impressed by one in particular. Their host didn't hold back when the projected result was announced - unleashing thoughts so many around the world had kept to themselves for so long.

An end to the bullying, the bitterness, the lying, the cheating, the abuse, the nastiness, the baseless accusations... I could go on. He did. I agreed with every word of it.

History will not judge Donald Trump kindly. He will be remembered for mocking a disabled person in front of a jeering crowd. He will be remembered for locking children in "very clean" cages. He will be remembered for the countless thousands of lies, for his lack of tact, kindness, and candour - and for his total lack of empathy. He will be remembered for cruel jokes, corruption, ignorance, and nepotism.

He will be remembered for so many things, and yet the world will also forget him. People will get on with their lives, and move on. People have an uncanny knack of holding on to good memories, and purging bad ones.

Here's to tomorrow, to hope, and to the future.

Our enormous ginger tom cat "George" is back in hospital tonight. After a major operation last week to save his life, complications arose over the weekend. We did the math, and it came down to saving his life for a second time and wiping our savings out, or having a difficult conversation with the children.

We now have no savings.

The operation went well, and he'll be home in a few days. Our bank account may take six months to recover though. I guess we'll be getting used to beans on toast for quite some time.

I'm not entirely sure where this post is going to go. It's three minutes until midnight on Sunday night, and you find me sitting in the dark of the junk room, typing like mad at the desktop computer, because I should really be in bed already.

I just spent the last couple of hours watching a wonderful video onYouTube with my other half - a Zoom meeting between the Lord of the Rings cast members organised by Josh Gad (you might know him as Olaf, the snowman, in Frozen). While in lockdown he's been organising cast reunions of iconic movies, and last week was the turn of the Lord of the Rings.

It was so lovely to see the cast back together again, sharing stories of their time on set together, and reminiscing. I won't ruin it too much for you - just go look up "[One Zoom to Rule Them All](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_U0S6x_kCs)" on YouTube.

If you've not seen it, please - just do it. I'm amazed that it was ever made, to be honest - given that a US studio signed off on it. I posted on Facebook about it, and wondered if the studio just didn't understand the message (you'll realise what I mean when you figure out which studio paid for it, and their political leanings).

Anyway. That got a bit heavy and judgemental.

I've been playing with the flight simulator some more, and my respect for airline pilots goes up each time I play with it. I've progressed on to a very realistic recreation of the Boeing 737. Tonight I "flew" from London to Groningen, and nearly killed all the passengers after missing some air conditioning switches during the pre-takeoff checklist. Thankfully the plane informed me via a violent klaxon while cruising at 20,000 feet.

I'm still not sure how real-world pilots handle the workload. Perhaps they don't spend time looking for switches and buttons though - perhaps they've learned where they are, what they do, and why they are pressing them.

I really need to go to bed now.

This was a late night blog post on behalf of the "writing a blog post in ten minutes because you feel like you should" party.

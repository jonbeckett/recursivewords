It's Sunday afternoon, and you find me holed up in the junk room at home, forcing myself to empty my head into the keyboard. The broken toe is slowly healing - doing as little as possible throughout the last week has helped a lot. Fingers crossed, I'll be back running again by mid August.

It's incredibly frustrating - my fitness was at about the 5K mark when the accident happened. I imagine it will take a few weeks to get any sort of stamina back after doing nothing for so long. I have started to wonder about doing some upper body workouts in the meantime. It's all about actually *doing* it though, isn't it.

Did I write about losing weight? Throughout the lockdown I have cut out snacks and alcohol. To begin with it was to support my eldest daughter who is trying to lose weight, but then the cat ended up in hospital, and now we don't have enough money for snacks or alcohol - so that kind of solved itself. In the space of a month, I have lost a stone (14 pounds). If I carry on at the current trajectory, by the time I start running again, I'll be about the same weight I was 20 years ago.

Anyway. I titled this post 'Out of the Loop', because it describes the way I feel at the moment pretty accurately. It feels like I'm slowly falling away from everything I have clung on to for the last however many years. Last week I removed the vast majority of those I had connected with through Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, and Facebook over the years. I guess the noise just got too much.

I really don't like the polarisation that's going on at the moment. Too many people seem to be standing on soapboxes and declaring that if you're not with them, you're against them. The easiest way to deal with it is of course to silence it - which you can do with the click of a mouse - and I have.

My email in-box has never been so quiet. I like it.

This evening I'm hoping to sit down with my family and watch the Eurovision movie on Netflix. I watched a clip from it earlier, and became unexpectedly emotional. Oh - completely forgot - I watched a wonderful movie earlier in the week, starring Morgan Freeman as a retired writer living for the summer in a friend's house, and begrudgingly befriending the family next door. I love quiet movies about ordinary people. It's called 'Once More' - look it up.

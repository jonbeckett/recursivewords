It's two minutes to midnight. I stopped work early this afternoon - I've been battling a cold I caught from the kids, and faced with writing a complicated document, decided to exercise some common sense. Of course this is me we're talking about - so rather than down tools completely, I sat quietly on the sofa with my laptop, and started putting a quiz together for tomorrow night.

Since lockdown first happened, and latterly since the office was shuttered, I have been hosting quizzes on zoom for my co-workers every so often. We haven't done one for a couple of months, so I volunteered myself once again. Hopefully the quiz will go down well, and we'll get a good turn-out.

There's is a huge temptation to stay up late tonight and watch the US presidential debate. I feel a little bit guilty - I'll only be watching for entertainment value - to see what sort of circus results, and perhaps more importantly if Trump will have a tantrum about being muted. I feel sorry for a lot of the people I know in the US - that they have had to put up with the daily pantomime for so long.

Perhaps a coffee and a rubbish movie might be an idea while waiting for the debate.

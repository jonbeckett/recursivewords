I think it was Fox Mulder that once said "nothing is ever really gone" - or words to that effect. Of course he was talking about the evidence of a crashed flying saucer. I'm talking about the vast swathe of words I used to pollute the internet with.

After tinkering for a little while this morning, I remembered an online service called "If This Then That" - a Heath Robinson method off employing digital sticky tape and string to attach services together. The end result of this tinkering? When I post words to my sleepy corner of the internet, they will now automagically appear elsewhere.

I can't help thinking it's a bit like Homer Simpson inventing the mobile on his desk that pressed a key on his keyboard every few seconds. Perhaps V-GER in "Star Trek The Motion Picture" is a better example - one day, when internet archeologists are digging through the annals of cyberspace, they will eventually reach ground zero, and find a tangled mess of sticky tape, string, and hand-written notes on screwed up pieces of paper.

Anyway. I need a coffee.

In other news, the household continues to trudge it's way through the COVID infested waters in the hereabouts. None of us have caught it (yet). The only days out we have risked have been to public parks - distancing ourselves from other visitors often by tens of yards. It seems to have worked. The only meal out we have had since February was at Kew in London for our eldest's birthday - and even then we sat outside, surrounded by screens. Perhaps the biggest risk to us as a family is my other half - who works in an infant school. You can have all the sensible rules in the world, but trying to get five year olds to follow them is another matter. That said, most children are fantastic at following rules - and castigating their parents for not following them.

Oh - finally - I started watching Season 3 of "Westworld" last night. It's the kind of show that sets cogs turning in the darker corners of your mind, and you find yourself waking up the next day still thinking about it.

Day two of the unplanned stay-cation.

The day started at 7am with our middle daughter standing at the end of the bed, announcing that the COVID19 tracing app on her phone had "gone off" - warning her that somebody she has had contact with in the last 14 days has tested positive for the virus - meaning in turn that she now has to self-isolate.

Not fun.

My other half was due to travel to the Lake District with her Mum early tomorrow morning for a few days away from everything - walking in the hills. She's been looking forward to it for months. That plan is now looking unlikely, because although incredibly unlikely, there's a risk our daughter could have the virus, and could have transmitted it to us, and she then could transmit it to her grandmother. It's a tiny risk, but it's still a risk.

The rest of the day has been remarkably quiet. I wandered into town with our youngest earlier and picked up some pizzas - I'll go and cook them in a minute.

I started watching "The Queen's Gambit" on Netflix last night. Several of my friends and family have mentioned it recently. It's based on a book - which I've now added to my wish-list on Amazon. Maybe one of the kids will get it me for Christmas. Books are almost always better than movies, or TV shows in my experience.

That reminds me - the sequel to "Ready Player One" comes out next month. If you've not read the book, you've missed out - you can't even compare it to the movie - and I'm sure I've ranted about it in the past. It remains one of the few books I've read more than once.

Right. I better go switch the cooker on.

Apart from the increasingly rare trips to the supermarket, and a walk to the park with my eldest daughter last weekend, I haven't left the house for perhaps three weeks. I get up each morning, have a shower, eat cereals, drink coffee, load the washing machine, hang clothes to dry, work throughout the day, help with dinner, wash up, then noodle around with the computer until I collapse into bed - day, after day, after day.

I'm slowly going stir crazy.

I haven't been running for ages - if nothing else, the confinement might be the thing that finally tips me out of the front door in my running shoes. Tomorrow morning sounds plausible all of a sudden.

The one positive to come from the continual seclusion is my blitz chess rating climbing inexorably back towards a level it has not seen in thirty years. I'm tempted to stop playing now, so I can look at the rating and gloat to myself.

On a Thursday night I might typically join some friends of my Dad online, and fly pretend aircraft somewhere exotic. I'll admit that the shine is slowly rubbing off that escapade. There's only so many times you can repeat the same routine without it becoming soporifically boring. Prepare your flight plan - prepare the aircraft - execute the flight plan (while talking to ATC) - then shutdown and say goodnight to everybody. Again, and again, and again.

Maybe I need to start working my way through the mountain of video games stacked on the shelf high above the junk room. Granted - most of them were acquired from the bargain bin at the second-hand games store, but they are still wonderful games. Forza Motorsport, Gears of War, Mass Effect, Halo, Half Life, Crysis, GTA, Saints Row, various versions of "Call of Duty" - the list goes on and on. And then of course there's the Raspberry Pi - configured to emulate every games machine of the 1970s and 80s - Mario, Sonic, QBert, Space Invaders, Asteroids, Defender, Pacman, Metal Slug - you name it. I suppose there's also the twenty year old Mac sitting under the desk - and the Amiga emulator on the laptop - that turns it into the computer I read about but never owned back in the late 1980s.

So many rabbit holes. So little time.

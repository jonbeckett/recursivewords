I missed lunch again today. Actually - missed is a bit of an exaggeration. I was working on something more interesting than stopping and eating, so grabbed something quick to eat, and carried on. I'm struggling to remember the last time I properly stopped at lunchtime - perhaps a week ago when I went for a run and the heavens dumped spectacularly on me for half an hour.

We had pasta and meatballs for dinner. Somehow this required the use of every pot and pan in the damn house. I notice this sort of thing, because I do the washing up. When dinner arrives on the table, the children step from the shadows like assassins from all corners of the house - usually wearing earbuds. After dinner I walk across the kitchen carrying plates and cutlery, turn around, and they are gone - as silently as they arrived.

I'm listening to one of the Starbucks playlists on Spotify. When I clicked the play button, I wondered if there is any sort of subliminal messaging hidden in the music - "buy a frappucino tomorrow" - something like that. I can't remember the last time I went in a coffee shop - probably the weekend before lockdown happened. When was that? March? Even though I rarely set foot in coffee shops, I've probably saved enough money to buy a coffee machine of my own. I have an aero-press somewhere - I should find it.

Now if you'll excuse me, I have some very important nothing to be getting on with before falling into bed. I'm going to try and turn in before midnight tonight. Wish me luck.

p.s. I didn't go running this morning.

Our entire household has to self isolate for the next day or so - for as long as it takes for my eldest daughter to get her COVID test result back. She has been fighting a bad cold for the last few days, and lost her sense of taste last night. Out of an abundance of caution, she informed her employer (she works as a Nanny), who requested she got a test.

And that's how our entire household started following the rulebook.

She got a test at 1pm, about twenty miles from home. The scare stories in the press are exactly that - scare stories. There was no queue. The testing centre was incredibly professional, and if anything scared my other half to death - she described it like something straight from an Area 51 conspiracy theory - with hasmat suits, shouted instructions through closed car windows, and mysterious codes stuck to car windscreens while being triaged to doctors.

I half expected the sticky note they brought home to have "PURITY CONTROL" written on it.

So anyway - we're stuck in the house for the next I don't know how long - and we have no coffee (because I drank it all). I have resorted to drinking the espresso that's been at the back of the cupboard forever. I'm pretty sure the smallprint on the label is in hebrew.

In other news, I helped an old friend retrieve her entire backlog of blog posts from a long forgotten blog. All she had was a database export file. I will freely admit to having something of a character failing when it comes to ridiculous challenges. Suffice to say after half an hour of head scratching, googling, and tinkering with code, I unloaded the entire backlog of her blog into a neatly formatted collection of text files.

Now all I need to do is build a throne like Thanos to sit in, and admire my own nerdiness. I wonder if your nerd level upgrades if you do something epic enough? With a blast of music and burst of light, like in Zelda ?

My ever-reliable body-clock went off at 5am this morning - I rolled over in bed, pulled on the headphones I had prepared the night before, and listened to free radio coverage of the boxing match between Wilder and Fury from Las Vegas. Of course by breakfast time a multitude of people had shared the "live" fight on YouTube, which should give anybody considering pay-per-view pause for thought.

Anyway.

Miss 16 has already left the house this morning for a rugby training session and hour and a half away. I'm accompanying Miss 14 to her training session, which also happens to coincide with a beer festival at the rugby club, and live coverage at the club of England playing in the "Six Nations" rugby tournament.

I've already been warned that I'm not allowed to drink too much - not that I would have, because I have work in the morning.

Now if you'll excuse me I have to go and wrangle children, and throw a few things in a bag. I need to get some cash out too - funds for bacon sandwiches at the rugby club :)

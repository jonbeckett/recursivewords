I worked from home today. I didn't set out to work from home. After cycling to work, a call from my eldest daughter mid-morning about the internet connection dropping out at home resulted in an about turn, packing my laptop into my backpack, and cycling home again.

I found the problem, and fixed it. I've tried to prevent it from happening again in the near future, but we'll see how it goes. At some point I have to call the internet service provider and tell them that the master socket into the house is dead. Again.

It feels like my entire life is going sideways at the moment. I'm not sure why. Not forwards, not backwards - just sideways. Maybe going sideways from time to time helps - it often seems to me that people become obsessed with either falling behind, or making progress - somewhere along the way they forget to live.

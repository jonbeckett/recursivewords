I never quite know from one day to the next what damn fool escapade I'll be involved in next. Tonight has been all about recording a private video diary - my eldest daughter's idea - a means of recording her thoughts about struggles with daily life - a way to empty her head, I suppose.

We now know how to upload videos to YouTube, how to edit them within YouTube, and how make sure that nobody ever sees them.

It seems a bit backwards, doesn't it - uploading videos to YouTube that nobody will ever see - but YouTube will store video for free, so it's a bit of a no-brainer.

And no, I'm not about to become a YouTuber. I'm only figuring this stuff out to help my daughter. Honest. No - really. Given how long it takes me to record the podcast each week, I dread to think how much more complicated it would become to record a video, where you have to not only sound interesting, but look good too.

I'll stick to blogging, and occasional podcasting. And maybe a private video diary for a few days - just to see if it's useful to my own mental health.

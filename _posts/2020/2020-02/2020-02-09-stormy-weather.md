If I had believed the weather forecasts last night, I might have imagined waking up to discover some sequin shoed legs extending from underneath the house this morning. Yes, the weather has been bad, but it hasn't been "you're not in Kansas any more" bad.

While on the subject of Kansas, how funny was it that Trump congratulated the entire state of Kansas in response to Kansas City winning the Superbowl? I live half a world away, and even I know that Kansas City isn't in Kansas. I'm not even going to get started on his firing of Vindman and Sondland. Actually, maybe I will.

I listened to Marc Maron's "WTF" podcast last week, and he ruminated on the realities of the US government becoming a totalitarian regime similar to China and Russia - it was food for thought, and I tended to agree with him - the people that voted for Trump still have no clue what they have really done. It will be a few years before the shit really hits the fan.

Over here in the UK, we seem to have gotten away with several years of idiocy from our government - where the people voted for just enough people in power to vote against anything and everything - in doing so keeping their jobs, and making sure nothing happened. It was no surprise when so many people held their hands up, exhaled, and voted in the party of the 1% in order to remove the deadlock.

Enough about politics.

It's been raining and windy here all day. They are calling it a storm on TV, and trees are down, but nothing like as bad as storms in the past. I still remember the "great storm" of 1987, that was not forecast, and brought the country to a standstill.

I'm not sure if it's something to do with how memory works, but I rememer far more lightning storms when I was little. Perhaps there were only one or two, and they stuck in my mind. I remember one particular lightning storm that took out power for the entire street, and caused my Mum to jump - in the middle of telling us everything was going to be fine.

I wonder what the cycle to work will be like in the morning ?

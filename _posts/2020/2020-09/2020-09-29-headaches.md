I was going to write a post this morning about mistakes - about how nobody is perfect, and about cancel culture. Then I thought better of it. Nobody wants to read that. I'll just stick to my quiet little life, my idiotic thoughts about inconsequential things, and leave others to fight the important battles. At the moment the most important thing going on around here is that I have a headache.

I had one small bottle of no-name it-was-on-offer lager after work last night, and I woke with a headache this morning. How does that even happen ? I like lager - it just doesn't like me.

I also have a cold. Maybe the headache is to do with the cold, and not the lager. Snotty nose and general rubbishness aside, things are pretty much alright at the moment.

The cat tried to pee on the telephone master socket again. Since his operation he can't aim his pee any more though, so all he did was leave a puddle on the floor, and pee down his own legs. He still hasn't learned.

I'm starting to miss people. Over the last year or two a lot of the people I used to know online have drifted away from social networks. Their blogs have either fallen silent, or vanished entirely. The few of us left have become unicorns in a strange sort of way - a throwback to when the internet was filled with stories of daily life instead of recycled junk.

It's the line from Good Will Hunting, isn't it...

"I can't learn anything from you, I can't read in some fuckin' book. Unless you want to talk about you, who you are. Then I'm fascinated. I'm in. But you don't want to do that do you sport? You're terrified of what you might say. Your move, chief."

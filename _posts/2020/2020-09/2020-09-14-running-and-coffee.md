I scraped myself out of bed before 7am this morning and went for a run. I must be mad. Or feeling guilty that I haven't been running (or done any sort of physical exercise) for weeks. I just ran a few miles around town, but it felt good. Good to be out doing something.

I have to keep reminding myself that it's half-way through September. After spending most of the weekend in a t-shirt and shorts, I retrieved the reflective waterproof I usually wear for evening runs from the depths of the closet, and hoped for the best.

During the height of lockdown you would see people out exercising every morning. That's all stopped. I ran right through the middle of town, and didn't see a single person. Nobody. I started to wonder if everybody had left town and not told me about some sort of impending doom.

I'm now killing the last half an hour before work starts. I just noticed an OpenReach van parked outside - they work on broadband network infrastructure. I have a call open about our continuing internet problems - fingers crossed they are here to help (cue exasperated look as they drive off without apparently doing anything).

It's my wedding anniversary tomorrow. We've somehow made it through nineteen years without killing each other. I think we're inviting some friends over to celebrate with us (read: we will feed some friends and make idiotic conversation - mainly to avoid killing each other).

I think perhaps a second cup of coffee might be a good way to start the day.

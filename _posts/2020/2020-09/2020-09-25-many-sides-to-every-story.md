For the last several years I've become increasingly frustrated with both journalism, and people in general. I think perhaps the root of it comes from publishing platforms targetting demographics, ideologies, or political leanings, and people being deliberately selective in what they read, what they believe, and what they trust as fact.

For much of my life I've sat on the fence about most things - played devils advocate. I expect it drives those that know me mad - knowing I will question anything and everything - that I take very little on trust. I read several news sources with a pretty cynical eye, and disregard most of the opinions of friends and acquaintances about whatever has triggered them until I've done some reading of my own.

And I typically keep my mouth shut.

I've learned the hard way that questioning the opinions of anybody that's been triggered enough to spill their guts all over social internet platforms is just asking for trouble. They will not listen, they will not be reasonable, and they will not want to hear any alternative thoughts. Even suggesting that there might be more to a story instantly makes you the enemy - ripe for cancellation, abuse, trolling, bullying, and belittling.

While it seems better to walk away, if we don't stand up for truth, protect diversity of thought and opinion, and listen without prejudice, the world becomes more divided, polarised, and dangerous.

Stephen Fry once wrote "The only reason people do not know much is because they do not care to know. They are incurious. Incuriousity is the oddest and most foolish failing there is."

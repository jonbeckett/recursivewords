After waking with a start at my other half's alarm clock this morning, I scraped myself out of bed, pulled some shorts on, and wandered downstairs in search of my running shoes. I hadn't planned on going running. The thought appeared in my head while staring straight through the bedside clock - half watching the minute hand slowly move around it's face.

After perhaps a mile, I decided I didn't feel that bad, so carried on towards the 5K lap around town. I listened to "The Retro Hour" podcast while running, and fiddled with my cheap bluetooth earbuds continually. Running and in-ear headphones don't really mix very well.

I surprised myself. I haven't run 5K for a couple of weeks. This morning I did it quite easily. No walking. No rests. Just a steady pace. I used to run 5 miles two or three times a week. That was ten years ago though. I wonder if I'll get back to that?

I should be thankful that I appear to be able to run without any real pain or discomfort. I know lots of other people suffer from shin splints, strains, pulls, or whatever else - it's rare that I have anything hurt while running - I just get tired. That doesn't stop me being paranoid of course. Today at about the 4K mark, I could feel a muscle in my groin tightening up - and thought "here we go". A few hundred metres on, it went away and I was fine.

Since then the day has been filled with programming, meetings, chores, and more meetings. I'm about to be tipped into a new project that will find me sitting in on meetings almost every day for the next three or four weeks. No doubt I'll write about it.

In other news, an old friend popped up in my phone this morning and made me smile. I need to remember to say hello to people - to send instant messages - it's too easy to lose touch, especially in the world we now find ourselves in.

Some good friends came over last night and sat outside with us while I cooked food on the barbecue. I somehow managed to drink two thirds of a bottle of wine while talking about everything and nothing with them, and boy did I know about it this morning. It didn't stop me going for a run though.

I'm not quite sure how my brain works with this whole running business - I guess I'm pretty good at being accountable to myself. I thought about staying in bed for an extra half hour, but something inside me stood me up, pulled on some shorts and a t-shirt, and delivered me to the doorstep.

I'm not particularly happy with how far I'm running, or how fast I'm running, but also realise that at least I'm doing it - at least I'm doing something.

I've already downed one coffee this morning. A second will be following in a few minutes.

In other news, lets try not to remember the huge ass spider that climbed on me while hanging washing on the line this morning. I have no idea how long he was on me, hitching a free ride around the house, before he decided to climb down my leg. It was a "false widow" - I don't think they are particularly dangerous, but probably enough to make the kids scream.

I meant to write something late last night. I got as far as writing "it's half past midnight", but somehow didn't get any further.

My mental batteries are drained. I've been working on software development projects for the last week. It's not easy to switch off - you turn over problems in the back of your mind late at night - or at least I do.

I need to get out of the house tomorrow - perhaps an early morning run. Anything really.

The world around us is slowly locking down again - caused by the legions of idiots that surround us. My other half forgot to take her lunch to work this morning, so I wandered up to the school via a service station that has a bakery on-site. While standing in the socially distanced queue with my mask on, I noticed the elderly man in front of me was not wearing a mask. There were signs everywhere instructing everybody to wear masks. He took no notice.

The internet connection is still dropping out all the time at home - we have had little or no internet for a week now. I'm relying on my work phone acting as a hot-spot to check email. There is a call open with our internet service provider, but no news so far. The kids are going out of their mind - deprived of YouTube and Tiktok.

Tomorrow may be all about books, cups of tea, and board games. If the weather is nice, perhaps a long walk away from everybody and everything - well, apart from the kids. I'm pretty sure if I announced "I'm going for a walk - I need some space for a bit", at least two of them would shout "I'm coming too"...

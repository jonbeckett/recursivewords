A couple of years ago the kids bought me a plastic model kit of the Saturn 5 moon rocket for my birthday. It sat on the shelf in it's box for the better part of a year, until one particularly dreadful weekend some time ago when I started assembling it. Unfortunately I never got much further than that - so it has sat, partially built, in the corner of the junk room ever since.

Until today.

Given the limited opportunities to go anywhere or do anything, our sights have turned inwards in recent days. Suddenly books might get read, movies might get watched, and model kits might get built. It's worth pointing out that before the kit of the Saturn 5 arrived in the house, the only model kit I had put together since I was about 13 was a small aeroplane that became part of a school project board for our youngest daughter. I glued - she painted.

It's been fun. While the rest of the household busied themselves with Wii Dance Party, YouTube, Fortnite, or whatever else this afternoon, I tried to figure out how to glue bits and pieces together without glueing myself to them, or to the desk.

I've had a cold for the last couple of days - nothing too bad - just a bullshit cold that any parent of children will roll their eyes at throughout the winter months. However - after a conversation with the HR manager at lunchtime, we agreed that I should perhaps work from home for the next few days. Let's not call it an "abundance of caution" - let's call it absolute paranoia instead. We'll also ignore that it took me another three hours to finally leave the building.

So - for the next few days I'll be holed up in the junk room at home with my work laptop, getting much more done than normal. Go me.

We had the conversation in the office (yet again) today, about how ridiculous it is that the company owns and operates offices, when we could all quite happily work remotely. I'm beginning to think it's a generational thing - the need to be in each other's faces. I'm quite happy existing behind Microsoft Teams and Outlook while working on development projects.

Anyway.

I have some sort-of-secret news. Somebody has sort-of-agreed to go on the podcast that is sort-of-famous - or at least they were quite a long time ago. That's all I'm saying about it at the moment - you'll have to watch this space.

Now if you'll excuse me, I'll get back to starting to panic about who I might record with this week in order to get an episode out by Friday night. If you would like to volunteer yourself, now would be a very good time.

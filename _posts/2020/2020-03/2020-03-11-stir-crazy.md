A curious thing happens when I work from home - in short order all the dirty clothes get washed, the clean clothes get folded, and the kitchen remains somewhat clean. Of course the reason any of this becomes possible is because I'm home alone - there are no teenage girls present to systematically destroy the house. While making coffee throughout the day, I notice if the washing machine has finished, and re-fill it - it's really that simple.

So yes - I worked from home today - the first day of perhaps many, given the madness and paranoia sweeping the world. Luckily my work isn't really affected by distance.

I might go a bit stir crazy by the end of the week though.

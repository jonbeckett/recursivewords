Somebody I have known for years and respect enormously blocked me today, and I feel kind of awful about it. I wrote a comment on one of their blog posts about the media reporting distorted statistics about Novel Coronavirus fatalities, and apparently that was the wrong thing to do.

The media ARE reporting distorted statistics though - if you spin the numbers it sounds more dramatic - which of course attracts eyeballs, which increases advertising revenue. It's an insidious game, and it needs to stop.

I am heartened however that so many people are pulling together and helping one-another. So many differences no longer seem particularly important. If anything good comes of this, it might be the return of community spirit. In recent days our local Facebook groups have been filled with people volunteering their time for others - to help those less able.

I'm reminded of the famous observation by Mr Rogers - 'Look for the helpers. You can always find people who are helping'.

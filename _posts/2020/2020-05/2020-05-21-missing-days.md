I think it's fair to say I've well and truly fallen off the blogging horse. After several years posting almost every day, I've dropped back to posting every few days, and it feels strangely fine. Nobody has come after me with a pitchfork (yet).

I'm sitting in the junk room for the first time in three days. It's just getting dark outside, and I'm wondering what I will fill the next four days with - I'm not due back in the office until Tuesday next week.

I'm still running with my youngest daughter every other morning - working our way through the "Couch to 5K" programme. She has unwittingly become something of a superstar at school - they are taking part in a challenge where all pupils are asked to walk, run or cycle, and to submit their miles towards an overall total. We are heading out on bicycles in the morning to finish the challenge in style - it finishes at noon - so will hopefully add quite a few kilometres to the final total.

It will surprise nobody to discover that I still haven't read any of the colossal mountain of unread books that I listed at the start of the coronavirus lock-down. Evenings have been spent watching movies, playing board games, meddling with computers, or running quizzes on Zoom. Days off have been spent fighting with our jungle of a garden.

I am starting to wonder how difficult it will be to resume normal life. For years our live has run on rails - working all week, doing chores throughout most evenings, then running ragged most weekends taking the children to sporting fixtures, washing kit, buying groceries, and so on. I'm not entirely sure how we did it, because even with days to burn, we're still somehow managing to fill them.

Anyway. It's getting late. Perhaps a glass of wine, and then bed.

p.s. I've been listening to a lot of Katherine Jenkins recently. I'm not entirely sure why. I didn't used to like her voice, but it's grown on me.

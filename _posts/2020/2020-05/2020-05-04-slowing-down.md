While juggling various requests from my daughters, friends, emails, and instant messages today, I realised that I need to take a step back from everything for a while. I need to slow down. It's too easy to find yourself attempting to be everywhere for everybody, all of the time. Or at least, it's too easy for me.

I still haven't touched the pile of books that was looming over me when lock-down began. I haven't read a single page. There's so many wonderful books - bought while wandering past bookshops before the social distancing insanity began. Obviously I didn't buy them while wandering past - it was more a case of "before I knew it, I wasn't walking past any more - I was in the book shop, and not entirely sure how I got there, or how long I had been there". Bookshops are a bit like that. I wonder if Stephen Hawking and Albert Einstein ever looked into them as a source of the missing mass in the universe ?

Of course you realise I'll still end up writing almost every day. I won't be able to help myself.

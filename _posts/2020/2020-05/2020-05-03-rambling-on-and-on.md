Rather than talk to anybody in particular on the podcast this week, I'm talking to myself. I'm pretty sure this is a direct route to madness, but I'll risk it.

I probably need to take a step back, don't I - since returning to WordPress, I haven't really talked about the podcast. I've been recording a podcast! I started in January, and have been putting a recording out roughly once a week - talking to fellow bloggers about where they are from, how they got started, what they write about - that kind of thing.

Anyway - this week's episode is just me on my lonesome, rambling on for a little while. It's surprisingly cathartic - I recommend it.

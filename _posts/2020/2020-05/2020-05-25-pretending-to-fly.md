I'm not sure that I have written so little for quite some time. Perhaps years. I haven't so much fallen off the blogging horse, as taken the wheels off the wagon, and re-purposed the chassis for some other purpose (firewood springs to mind).

There are all sorts of thoughts swimming around my head about the future. Is this the end of my writing a daily journal? Perhaps. Is it a reflection on life slowing down, and realising that some things might be more important than telling a daily story where nothing much happens? Probably. Perhaps I'm finally realising that I don't have to be out here, scribbling incessant posts every day - recording anything and everything. Perhaps a little now and again is enough.

In other news, I have more evidence that I'm living in a TV show.

I went for a walk with my daughter this morning - along the river to a nearby town, across the hills, and home again. We saw very little evidence of other people until we reached a road junction not far from home - a junction where I have always joked about unwittingly starring in my own show. Having not seen any cars for several hours, we approached the junction, and my daughter announced "cue the cars" - and out of nowhere, we coud not cross the road - four cars passed in a train - one behind the other. I burst out laughing, and pointed into the distance in all directions - there were no other cars in sight for perhaps a quarter of a mile in any direction.

If I AM starring in my own TV show, it would explain a LOT of things.

In yet more news, I've been playing with pretend aeroplane simulators again. I was talking to my Dad the other day about the fun he has "flying" online with his friends, and it sparked something inside me. Over the weekend I have taught myself how to navigate via GPS (I already knew how to use VORs, NDBs, DME etc), and had all sorts of fun pretending to fly from pretend airport to pretend airport in a light aircraft.

So there you have it. While not writing endless platitudes about very little, I have been pretending to pilot light aircraft, and inventing challenges for myself. When I finally get around to flying with my Dad's friends, somehow I don't think they'll find my radio skills very humorous - "Heathrow Control, would like to order a deep pan pepperoni for pick up - approaching from the south west at 100 knots, ETA 30 minutes. Juliet Bravo 73 Over."...

It's Friday, and you find me holed up in the junk room at home, putting together another quiz. This evening the company I work for are having a "virtual social" on Zoom, and I volunteered myself as quiz-master. Although I have run several quizes recently, I'm putting together an entirely new set of questions, so the rest of my family can take part.

While I work on the quiz, the younger children are heading into town to get some groceries. I can't really go anywhere today - even though I'm not working - because I have agreed to be "on call" for any support issues at work. I wasn't planning on going anywhere, so it's not really a hardship.

While tidying the junk room up yesterday I fished the old iMac out, and powered it up. It's over 20 years old now, and STILL WORKS. I keep wondering if I should give it away to somebody that might get some use out of it, but can never quite bring myself to part with it. I keep telling myself I'll use it for writing, but I never quite get around to it.

I bought a game for the kids to play yesterday - a crafting and exploration game on Steam called "Starbound". After not hearing anything from our eldest for a few hours, I checked in on her, and discovered her still playing it - so it can't be that bad. If I make some time later, I might have a look at it myself.

Finally, I watched the movie "Midway" last night. I hate to say it, but it's nowhere near as good as the version made in the 1970s with Charlton Heston. Yes, the new movie has got spectacular special effects (which look very fake), but it has none of the strategic maneouvering that is covered so well in the older movie. The dive bombing scenes were unintentionally hilarious - with the age-old "every time we cut back to see the ground coming, we're still as far away from it as last time we looked"... I swear - some of the dive bombing runs fell through the same altitudes four or five times.

Anyway.

This post was a bit random, wasn't it.

Although I'm only posting every other day at the moment, life goes on. We're still running, and I'm still cycling fairly regularly. Work is down to three days a week at the moment, which strangely means that I'm struggling to figure out which day of the week it is. We're all well though, so we can't complain.

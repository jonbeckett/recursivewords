Last autumn I took part in the "Couch to 5K" running programme at the local running club - to support my eldest daughter both with her fitness, and in her battle with anxiety. We joined a small intrepid band of new runners each week, and pounded the streets together every Tuesday evening. Over time the distances increased, and in early December we "graduated" - completing several organised 5K runs around town.

We had planned on starting to take part in park runs - a weekly 5K organised run at the big park in town every Sunday morning - but then the entire town flooded for several months, and then the Corona Virus hit. We stopped running in early December, and haven't done anything since.

Having been in lock-down for the last several weeks, the children were becoming increasingly restless, so my other half volunteered me to re-start the Couch to 5K programme with them. In case you're starting to see a pattern forming, yes - I get volunteered for a lot of things.

We made it through three weeks before a mysterious injury afflicted me on the way down the stairs one day. I was carrying a pile of towels towards the washing machine - as you do - when something suddenly hurt. That was last week.

This morning, we reset again - this time with the NHS Couch to 5K App on my phone - with Olympic champion Michael Johnson encouraging us throughout the programme, with his deep booming voice announcing "You're doing great - the next run starts in 3 - 2 - 1 - go for it!". Part of the reason for resetting is because a circle of acquaintances on Facebook have also started from zero with the same app - so we get to share our progress, and encourage each other.

My only reservation so far is that my knee hurt almost immediately this morning. I'm wondering if it's just because I'm sitting down a LOT at the moment, and perhaps crucially, not cycling. On a normal workday, I would cycle 6 miles - that hasn't happened since March. I'm going to try getting the bike out on the in-between days, and just go for a quiet ride around the local area.

Fingers crossed!

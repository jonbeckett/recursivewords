I'm not doing very well at posting on anything like a regular basis, am I. Let's just say that this week has been challenging, and I'm not going to write about any of it on a public forum. I want to write "the walls have eyes", but that's a little overly conspiratorial even for me.

I'm fine. Really. Just tired. The storm that has engulfed my life for the past several days is beginning to abate, and I find myself drawn towards the blog once again. When I don't post for a few days, it feels like the blog calls to me. It's very odd.

So. It's Thursday. I arrived at work about an hour ago, and have been trying to make sense of what I need to do that will most successfully cause everybody to leave me alone until the end of the day. I'll let you know how I get on with that - I'm not usually very successful.

Just a few words to tell those of you that follow me that everything is fine, there is nothing wrong, and the gaps in my almost-daily posts are just down to life happening. I flew home from Germany yesterday, then went to the local radio station quiz night, spent much of today at the local carnival, and then went out to a movie, dinner, and bowling with my family this evening.

Tomorrow may be a much quieter day, so maybe a few more contemplative words will make their way from my head, through the keyboard, to the internet. Stranger things have happened.

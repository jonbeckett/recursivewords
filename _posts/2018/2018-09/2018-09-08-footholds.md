I have somehow ended up with almost identical blogs at WordPress, Tumblr, and LiveJournal. Yes, LiveJournal still exists - stop laughing. Anyway - cutting a very long, introspective, and boring story short, I'm going to limit the almost-daily head emptying posts to just WordPress. I find myself being drawn into all three communities and trying to keep a foot-hold in each - which it turns out is quite difficult when you only have two feet.

It's all become a bit mad - with blogging, instagramming, snapchatting, whatsapping, and whatever else competing for the couple of free hours I might excavate for myself each day. I need to make time for more crossyroading dammit.

Now if you'll excuse me, I have a third cup of coffee to go make while avoiding ironing clothes into a bag ahead of flying to Germany in the morning.

I feel like I'm in-between everything at the moment, and I don't know how to explain it. Not just in-between doing things more like I have fallen into some kind of gap in the world while the rest of the world carries on with their day, I have stumbled into a hole that nobody else can see they see me of course, but not the hole.

I'm probably making no sense at all.

It feels like being disconnected from everybody and everything. Its a strange feeling. Rather than watch TV, read books, play video games, or do anything else, I go from one distraction to the next, until I notice the clock has betrayed me, and somehow wound itself forward to the early hours of the morning.

I'm sure the world will right itself eventually that I will escape the in-between. No doubt my escape will be accompanied by a slew of people-watching posts, observations of life happening around me, or other such idiocy. Until then, lets just pretend I'm on some kind of hiatus or something.

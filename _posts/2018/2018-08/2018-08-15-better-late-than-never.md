If all goes according to plan, at the weekend a parcel will arrive in the post with five iPhones in it. Both mine, and my other half's phone contracts have come to an end, and we have been looking around at the various deals available. At the same time, we're going to move our children from pay-as-you-go phones to contracts, meaning they will not run out of credit while out with their friends.

It turns out buying five contracts for the iPhone SE was cheaper than the two idiotic handsets myself and my other half have been paying through the nose for. We have no illusions why either - Apple is obviously about to release the iPhone SE 2, so has quietly told all the networks to offload their old hardware.

Here's the thing - I don't really care about having a "flagship phone" - I've been there, done it, and realised it's a stupid game to get swept up in. As long as my phone does all the things you might expect, I don't really care. Hell - I haven't even had a personal phone for the last few months - I've been using my work phone, on account of my other half smashing hers. I gave her my handset at the same time I started using the Nokia 3310. Of course I then lost the little Nokia, but we won't dwell on that.

The children are predictably ecstatic. I'm not entirely sure why. Perhaps the label on the back of the phone means far more to a teenager than it does to me.

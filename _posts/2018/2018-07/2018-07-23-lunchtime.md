It's lunchtime at work, and I'm forcing myself to take a break. On a given day I sit here for hours - sometimes not leaving the chair all day, and then wondering why my legs are stiff when I get up to go home. Of course I cycle to work, so I'm not completely unfit, but I really should do something more. Years ago, I used to go running a couple of times a week - maybe I should try and make time for it once more. It's all about forming habits really - getting into a routine.

Most of the schools around here finally wind down for summer today. It's been noticeable on the roads - a lot of families have already left for their summer vacations. On the way home last night I would normally face numerous idiots either driving me off the road, cutting me up, or pretending I don't exist in their military grade 44 child ferrying monstrosities. Last night I saw nobody at all for the last mile towards home - no cars, no people - nobody. I imagine they have all gone to the mediterranean, and are busy uploading a steady stream of showing off to Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.

One of my co-workers has just come back off holiday. While in a market in Italy, a Romanian boy sold him a packet of "Halva", that he brought it for us to try. It's kind of like sugary chipboard, mixed with wood shavings out of a hamster's cage. I might have to get a hot drink to take the taste away.

In other news, I played the age-old game of "stay up late to avoid tomorrow" last night. Normally this would only result in me losing the game, and stumbling around like one of the undead this morning (both of which happened). The unexpected result was falling into a conversation with somebody I've half-followed on Tumblr for years, and realising that we followed each other way back in the mists of time. She pulled a photo from somewhere, and suddenly there was a face I hadn't seen for perhaps ten years peering back at me. It got me thinking - about how we are all strangers, but somehow throw ourselves into the same melting pot as each other when we post to blogs, share photos, or whatever else.

Anyway. I really do need to go make a drink, before the Halva turns into quick drying cement inside me.

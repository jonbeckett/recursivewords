I'm seriously considering drawing a line under this whole blogging adventure again. I nearly did it a couple of months ago, and then returned. I've soldiered on, posting less regularly, and still struggled to find anything worth writing about.

Maybe if I stop blogging, I might find time to go running, or start writing a novel, or even read a few of the books that have been patiently waiting on the shelf behind me for several years.

I'll still be at Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, so it's not like I'm going anywhere. Maybe it really is time to end this though.

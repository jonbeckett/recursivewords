I have been invited to a barbecue this evening - hosted by a wonderful friend that lives across the way. I'll stop on the way home to buy beer and wine. After the last few weeks, I'm looking forward to an evening with old friends, eating simple food, laughing, and erasing recent stresses.

Perfect start to the weekend.

Today is a bank holiday in the UK. I've been up since 8am, and haven't really got anything done. Sure, I fed the animals, and let the chicken out (we're looking after it for the local infant school), but other than that - nothing of consequence.

I re-installed the old desktop computer with Ubuntu Linux. I've lost count of the number of times I've installed other things on it, then reverted. I need to put a sticky-note on the USB stick - 'don't you f*cking do it again, you idiot'.

A friend talked me into signing up with dreamwidth.org a couple of nights ago. I used to have a blog at LiveJournal, with the same content a WordPress, but got uncomfortable when Russia and the entire rest of the world fell out with each other recently, so walked (LiveJournal was sold to a Russian company some years ago). Walking away from LiveJournal meant I lost touch with her. If cross-posting to dreamwidth means we keep in touch, I have agreed to do it.

Now if you'll excuse me, I have some serious procrastinating to get on with. Perhaps I'll write out my bullet journal for the week ahead - listing all the things I won't be doing.

Perhaps a cup of coffee first.

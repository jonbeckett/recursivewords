It's almost the weekend. I'm watching the last few minutes of Friday tick down. I need this weekend - but of course I'm not going to get this weekend. Far from it.

Miss 12 became Miss 13 this morning. We all sat around in the lounge in various states of sleepiness while she ripped open her presents - except for Miss 17 who couldn't be bothered to get out of bed. I imagine this evening will be taken up with cleaning up after a house full of her friends. They've been to a trampoline park this afternoon.

Tomorrow is football. I have no idea where they are playing. Sunday is rugby - I'm getting a lift with another family because of course our children aren't playing at the same place as each other - those coincidences are deliberately rare to make you think you have an easier weekend (until you get home and set the washing machine on fire).

Anyway. Time to shut my computer down. I'm going home via the supermarket, with orders to get toppings to make pizzas for a house full of 12 and 13 year old girls.

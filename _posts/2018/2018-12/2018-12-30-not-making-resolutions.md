So. Here you are. You made it to the end of another year, and so did I. I seem to have made it by the rather unoriginal method of putting one foot in front of the other - and continuing to do so. Others seem to have had all manner of adventures, drama, and disaster along the way - I didn't really notice, because I was busy concentrating on where my next footstep was landing. Because this rather eccentric method - lets call it "plodding" - has served me so well this year, I see no need to change it any time soon.

So no. I'm not going to be making any grand "resolutions". I don't even know why people call them "resolutions", when the things people typically list are goals. The dictionary definition of a resolution is "a firm decision to do, or not do something". You can't just decide you're going to get fit, or lose weight, or travel more - they are all goals - things you will plan to do.

Actually, maybe you can make resolutions - this is where I stand on a chair and shout "I'm going to stop eating chocolate!" - and know instinctively that there's no way on earth it will happen. Perhaps that's why the phrase "resolutions are made to be broken" exists.

Perhaps we should call resolutions lies instead. It sounds far more reasonable - standing on a chair, and shouting "I have a lie for the new year - I'm totally going to stop eating chocolate!" - and everybody will laugh, because they know me.

Anyway. There you go. Not making any resolutions. I will spend tomorrow (with a hangover) trying to organise my new bullet journal though. I like the bullet journal method, because you write it as you go. Kind of like plodding along, looking at your feet really.

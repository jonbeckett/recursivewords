At midnight tomorrow night the ball of mud we live on will spin a little further around the vast nuclear reactor it orbits. The day that follows will be pretty much like the one that came before - much like the thousands - millions even - that came before that, and that will continue to happen far into the future - long after we are a distant memory.

Humans have a habit of attaching invented importance to things. We notice coincidences, and describe them as fate. We describe unexplained behaviour as "nature" rather than "nurture". We berate our own bad luck rather than admit apathy, or failures of judgement.

Wouldn't it be wonderful if everybody could slip on a pair of blinkers, and only see the future - the possibilities - the things that might be, rather than look back and grieve what might have been.

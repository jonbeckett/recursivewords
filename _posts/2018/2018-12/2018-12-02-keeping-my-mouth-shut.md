I almost wrote a furious post at lunchtime about something that happened at the weekend - a series of things that happened at the weekend really - a direct response to the behaviour of a number of people I had the ill fortune to cross paths with.

Rather than write anything I might later regret, let's just conclude that my rather dim view of cliquey, snobbish people is not without merit. Perhaps the most depressing part is that the parents often model their thoughtless, conceited, aloof behaviour to their children, who unwittingly foster the same prejudices.

Like I said - I'll keep my mouth shut. A part of me wants to believe that it's a minority - that most people are inherently good - but when you continually face the same kinds of people again and again, you begin to suspect everybody you meet - and that seems tremendously unfair.

Anyway. Enough of that.

I'm trying to think of something positive to write - to turn this post around - to find something hopeful, or optimistic to end on. At least this post isn't another few thousand words from NaNoWriMo, hey? That's a good thing, right?

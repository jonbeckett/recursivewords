Those that have followed my recent adventures on the internet will have seen both my retro-mac inspired run at NaNoWriMo, and the experiment with "Tiny Letter" - both ideas running against the tide somewhat in an eccentric attempt to get back to where we all started.

I'm thinking about going further. I have been turning the idea of writing letters and cards over in my head for a little while. There's something about a real piece of paper arriving through the letterbox with distant postmarks stamped on it. There's something about handwritten words - about them having been formed directly by the author - they are somehow more intimate, more truthful than their typewritten descendants.

If you are wondering where this all came from, there has been a tipping point of sorts this morning - the news from Tumblr that censorship is being imposed in a somewhat nuclear fashion - a reminder that the social platforms that connect us are owned and run by others - and that the freedoms they afford us can be pulled away as quickly as they are given.

If you're interested in sharing letters or cards, go visit the contact page and let me know how to get in touch to swap addresses.

I'm wiped out. I scraped myself out of bed at 7am, arrived in the office ay 8:30am, and worked straight through until 5pm. The first two hours of day were stressful, to say the least (and no, I can't share why). After work I wandered to the Japanese restaurant just along the road, and came straight back to begin working on designs for the things I'll be building over the next few months.

It's midnight now, and I'm wiped out. I have a massive mountain to climb over the next few months. Being honest, I can't see how I'll get everything done unless I work weekends and evenings. Maybe I'll have a word about overtime.

Anyway. Sleep. I need some sleep.

I fly home tomorrow morning. I did a little work this evening, but nothing like the epic slog the last few evenings turned into. You don't even want to see the state of my bullet journal - page after page filled with scribbled notes, and half-drawn diagrams. At some point over the next few days I need to start turning the chaotic mess into something that makes sense.

Just to cap off a craptastic week, I called home a few minutes ago, and realised I forgot my other half's birthday. I had been planning on ordering flowers and a present via the internet, but with all the mayhem over the last few days, it completely slipped my mind. I knew I was in trouble at "hello" on the phone.

Needless to say, Amazon was visited.

I've been trying to think of something to write for the last hour, but I really have nothing to share beyond "sat in a conference room all day, then worked in the hotel most of the evening". I've eaten at the same Japanese restaurant just down the road every night - purely because it is quick, easy, and not very far away - meaning I could come back and carry on working fairly quickly.

Anyway. I need to sleep.

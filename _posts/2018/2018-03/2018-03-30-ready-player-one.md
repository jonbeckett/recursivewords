I finally got to the cinema yesterday to see Ready Player One, and came away not really disappointed, but not enthused either.

I guess the biggest problem for the movie is that the book was so good, and in many ways impossible to turn into a movie at all. There was so much missing, and the story was changed in so many ways. Without a lot of the exposition and background the book provides, huge swathes of the story made no sense what-so-ever.

It didn't help that the local cinema had the sound turned down to perhaps 75% of where it should have been, which caused the most exciting scenes in the movie to be no more dramatic than watching an episode of a soap opera.

If you have not read the book, but have seen the movie, go read the book anyway - because it's a completely different story, and far better than the movie.

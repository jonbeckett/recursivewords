I don't think "Monday from Hell" really covers it. Lets just say that when a teenager stops taking her anxiety medication, the wheels will eventually fall off both of your wagons, and you'll spend the hour before you go to work completely and utterly losing your shit with her, before cycling to work, feeling bad about how you reacted, then returning as soon as you could to work from home from the rest of the day.

We have about five weeks until she takes her exams, and we can then hopefully turn a page. It doesn't help that the one friend she has outside of college is somebody that dropped out of college. If she does the same, she will end up with no qualifications, no job prospects, and no future. If you've every tried to explain this to a teenager, you'll understand that you probably sound like Charlie Brown's teacher as you waffle-rant at them.

In other news, I'm back working on the Germany project. I'm writing documentation this week, and then flying out next week to hand over the work done so far, and to plan for the next sprint. There have been murmurings about flying out three times in three weeks early in the summer. That's going to be fun. I'll try and find a hotel with a restaurant before then - sitting on my own in the hotel restaurant has got to be easier than finding new places to eat each night. I never thought I'd ever write that.

Coffee. I need a coffee. (Five minutes pass while I drink a pretty forgettable cup of instant coffee)

It struck me earlier that I never think of looking up bloggers in the various cities I visit with work. Would that seem a bit weird - trying to find people that live somewhere, so you can accidentally on purpose meet up for a drink while visiting the city ? I think it might have been a lot easier years ago, but so few people write journal-style blogs these days, the chances of finding anybody are relatively slim (says the person that hasn't looked).

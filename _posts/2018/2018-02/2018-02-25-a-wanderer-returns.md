You know the one where you start the year disconnecting yourself from social media, blogging, instant messaging, and everything else - swearing that you're done with it - but then slowly find yourself returning ? That.

At least I didn't delete any accounts this time. I'm learning. Slowly. Maybe we'll call it a rest. A vacation from the shit-storm.

I'm re-visiting old haunts, but consciously not looking up too many old acquaintances. I want to take things slowly - let others find me serendipitously, rather than go on any ridiculous fishing expeditions.

You're probably wondering where on earth I'm talking about - given that I rarely cross the streams. I use the same username at WordPress, Tumblr, and LiveJournal. Before you start, I know it's madness.

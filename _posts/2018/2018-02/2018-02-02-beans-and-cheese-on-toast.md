After the relentless questioning from Miss 12 grew almost continuous, I caved and made lunch for everybody - well, everybody except my other half who has gone out for the day.

"What shall we have then?"

Shrug.

I had a look through the cupboard, and discovered several tins of beans - one of them with sausages in.

"How about beans on toast with cheese on top? - with sausages in the beans - look!" (I showed her the tin).

She didn't just nod - her eyes opened wide as she nodded. This is the Miss 12 equivalent of "Hell yes!". One problem - no bread. Five minutes later I had pulled a coat on, and wandered off into the rain that has been falling all morning.

We have a wonderful corner shop. Although we call it a "corner shop", it isn't on a corner - it's in the middle of a busy suburban road, flanked on all sides by houses, and usually decorated by several teenagers standing outside. I imagine the teenagers are either trying to scrape enough money together to buy something, or drawing straws on who will attempt to buy alcohol.

After arriving back at home - still minus one daughter who was still at a football match - I discovered Miss 12 putting saucepans on the hob. "Are you hungry by any chance?"

She grinned.

Half an hour later - after answering the door to a bedraggled girls team goalie covered in mud and ushering her towards the bath - I put the beans on, and threw some bread in the toaster.

Those few minutes - sitting around the dinner table eating lunch together - were magic. Nobody said a word - they just ate. Everything. I know some people look down their nose at things like beans on toast, but on a cold wet day I challenge anybody to find something better.

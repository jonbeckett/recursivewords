It's all over again. Miss 17 called an end to the relationship that has caused her so much frustration and heartache in recent weeks. We're trying not to say "I told you so". I spent much of yesterday evening watching TV with her curled up next to me, and this morning standing on the touchline of her younger sister's football game, arm in arm.

As much as it's nice to have her back again, I feel sorry for her having to learn the hard way again and again about the behavior of others. I imagine this evening will turn into a late night movie marathon while I try to put her back together again.

It's just gone 9am, and I'm sitting at my desk in the office at work, still not really awake. I woke at 5 this morning, then fell back asleep for a couple of hours before scraping myself out of bed and getting on with the morning routine.

We are a chicken down. In the middle of a perfect storm of child-induced mayhem last night I didn't get around to shutting the chicken in until the sky was already dark. That was all the opportunity a local fox needed. Yet another chicken we have lost to the local band of suburban foxes. Of course it had to be the school's chicken, so we will now have to buy a similar looking one and replace it - a bit like the famous stories of hamsters that change colour during the summer holidays.

As you can tell, I'm procrastinating. Avoiding getting on with development work on the vertical cliff-face of a project I have been working on for the last several months. I fly back out to Germany at both the beginning, and end of next month. Another two weeks spent in Frankfurt, enjoying a tiny hotel room, a corporate conference room, and a selection of nearby restaurants and supermarkets each time. I think I've flown more in the last 12 months than the rest of my life added together.

It feels like Friday today. I'm not sure why. I'm already wondering how we are going to make it through the weekend at home - we are going to a wedding reception tomorrow night, then a football tournament on Saturday, and a rugby tournament on Sunday.

Never mind though - because I BOOKED A WEEK OFF WORK!

After making better progress than anybody expected over the last week, the chance appeared to book a few days off, and I grabbed it. I'll just be knocking around at home (it's half term week), but the break will be welcome. I'll try and get the garden sorted out while I'm off - at least it will keep me busy.

Right. Sandwich guy just arrived, and I now have to avoid eating the food I bought. A piri piri chicken baguette is staring at me, along with a flapjack, and mars bar. There's no way it's all going to make it to lunchtime intact.

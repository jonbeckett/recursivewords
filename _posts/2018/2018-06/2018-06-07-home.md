I woke ten minutes before the alarm on the phone this morning, and showed my face for breakfast in the hotel a little after 6am. After downing a coffee and some croissants, I finished packing my bag, checked out, and splashed through the rain to Frankfurt station. Half an hour later I was at the airport, and half an hour after that at the gate for my flight. Two hours early.

Over the course of the next two hours, Lufthansa decided to change the gate twice. I imagine that was also the reason for the flight being half an hour late too - moving the plane all over the damn airport.

To be honest, the journey home has been remarkably uneventful. Trains ran on time, and even connected with each other where they needed to. By mid-afternoon I was home, and up to my elbows in washing up.

It's good to be home. It's the little things - like being able to make a hot drink whenever you like (there was no kettle in the hotel room), having a proper sofa to go sit on, and of course having a fast internet connection.

Now if you'll excuse me, I have a cup of coffee to make, and a world of email, blogs, and TV shows to catch up on. Actually, we all know that's a lie - I don't watch much TV at all. I'm going to sit and do nothing for a change.

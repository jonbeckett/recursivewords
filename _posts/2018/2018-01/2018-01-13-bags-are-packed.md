A variety of clothes have been washed, ironed, folded, and packed. My work backpack has been emptied of it's usual ephemera, and re-filled with the bare essentials associated with a work trip, various devices are on charge, and I've already performed a "remote check-in" with the airport ahead of the journey tomorrow.

I just spent the last half an hour looking for the charger for my camera. I finally discovered it in my other half's camera bag - this is true to form. She currently has my USB C cable, and my work backup-battery, because she left hers at work - the three I ordered for her from Amazon, and the one from home. This kind of thing happens all the time, and is always blamed on not having enough time to do anything.

While the rest of the family have gone to London for the day - a trip to the theatre for the newly crowned Miss 14's birthday - I have been busy washing clothes, tidying the house up, grocery shopping - the usual chores.

With a little luck I'll get around to reading a book or two while away. I have several to choose from - no doubt I'll write about them if and when I get around to them.

The only thing left to remember is a wash bag in the morning. Given the zero-maintenance haircut, it's not going to have much in it besides a toothbrush, toothpaste, deodorant, disposable razors, and shaving gel. After trying out one of the hipster razor subscription things (Harry's, Cornerstone, etc) in recent months, I cancelled it last autumn, and went back to disposables. They are a quarter of the price, and do exactly the same job.

Anyway! I feel a cup of tea coming on.

After a mammoth session recording expenses for this week's adventures in Germany, I returned home after lunch to keep Miss 17 company. Her teenage friends seem intent on turning her inside out at the moment, so of course I'm going up to bat for her again, and again, and again. None of this is in the parent instruction book (not that I read it anyway).

Working from home really means "keeping half an eye on e-mail". While doing so I have re-installed the old desktop computer at home - replacing Windows 7 with Ubuntu. We only ever use this computer to access the internet, so it kind of makes sense.

I'm also listening to Q-107 on the internet - a radio station from the US with a show hosted by an old friend. Hearing her voice reminds me how many friendships I have let slide. I need to do something about that.

Friday night is pizza night. My other half just did a run to the store to get pizzas for dinner. We have been making our own for the last several weeks, but given the rubbish week everybody has had, we have bought ready-made ones tonight. Next task - find a suitably rubbish movie to watch while eating them.

Ten more minutes of watching the work email account, then it's the weekend. Thank the maker.

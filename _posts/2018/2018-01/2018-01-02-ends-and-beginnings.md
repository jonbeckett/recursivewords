I'm sitting at the desk in the junk room at home, writing this on the old desktop PC. Sia is filling the room with "Chandelier" via the Fire TV wired up to the old TV across the room. Miss 12 is in her room, eating Sushi made last night by Miss 17. We are the last people left in the house - the older children and my other half have returned to school, college, and work today. I go back to work tomorrow morning.

Christmas officially left our house this morning. I hadn't been planning to take the decorations down until Saturday (12th night, and all that rubbish), but found myself with nothing to do earlier, and thought "f*ck it". Within an hour everything was down, packed, and back in the attic until next year. Suddenly the house seems spacious again.

The washing machine is back in action today - I'm trying to clear the decks before the onslaught of football, rugby, and school begin filling the clothes bins faster than we can empty them. While sorting, washing, drying, and folding clothes, I often wonder "is this it - is this my entire life?". I know it's a ridiculous thought.

I'm quietly stressing about a meeting first thing tomorrow morning - where I will get some idea how the next year is going to pan out. I'm central to several huge projects - all involving travel. I think I mentioned last year about my pending return to Frankfurt. I imagine that will happen quite quickly. I suppose at least by mid-morning tomorrow I'll know what the future has in store for me.

Tomorrow morning will be a first commute wearing a helmet camera

In closing I just wanted to take a few moments to say that I have really come to appreciate the little group of friends I have made via the blog in the last few months. You're from all over the world, and from all walks of life, and yet here we all are - out on the edge of the internet, sharing the unspoken stories of our days with each other. You know who you are, and you probably have no idea how much I value our friendships.

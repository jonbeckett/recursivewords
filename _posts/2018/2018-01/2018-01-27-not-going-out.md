It's heading towards lunchtime on Sunday. There are some bagels with my name on them on the kitchen counter, waiting for me to fill them with cheese and whatever else I can find in the fridge. I'm home alone with Miss 17, who refused to get up this morning - she asked yesterday if I might take her shopping in a nearby town, but by this morning the enormity of actually getting out of bed defeated her. I on the other half was up by 8am, showered, shaved, dressed, and doing chores.

I just ordered new work clothes from the internet. I would have bought them in town today, and was annoyed that the shopping trip wasn't happening - until it dawned on me that you can order things on the internet and have them delivered. I know. I know. I work with technology - but I really am that stupid sometimes. Five minutes after signing up for a store login with a huge department store that can deliver for free, I had ordered three shirts, seven pairs of socks, a pair of shoes, and a new tie. I had to stop looking around in the end, because I would have kept clicking the "buy" button on things.

"Oh yes, I need a travel chess set. Oh - and one of those tie clips. That travel wash kit looks good too. Oh, and an MP3 player shaped like a dog".

I'm wondering what I'm going to fill the rest of Sunday with. The chores are mainly done, and my other half won't arrive home with the younger children until late afternoon. Miss 17 is holed up in her room playing some kind of Manga inspired game, and the cats really don't care if any of us have been run over by a truck.

I asked my other half if she wanted me to cook tonight, but she said she will pick something up on the way home - so I don't even have the evening meal to worry about. I cooked spaghetti bolognese for everybody last night - which you might normally think of as an easy meal, except two of us are vegetarian, and one is gluten free, so you have to make everything twice. Nothing is ever simple.

Maybe I'll talk Miss 17 into a walk into town, to pretend we're part of cafe society for an hour. We can prop up a table in Starbucks and watch the world go by.

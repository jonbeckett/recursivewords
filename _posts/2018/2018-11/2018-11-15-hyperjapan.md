I'm catching the early train to London tomorrow morning with Miss 18 - we are visiting HyperJapan - an expo of everything to do with Japanese culture - food, art, movies, music, clothes, manga, anime, cosplay, and so on.

It's all my fault apparently - for getting her started on Studio Ghibli movies, and manga books when she was younger. Now I just annoy her by asking "what's kawaii again?... and chibi?"

I stayed up until midnight on Wednesday night, and wrote eighteen hundred words before falling into bed a little after 1am. I then wrote during lunchtime yesterday, a little more last night, and a little over lunchtime today - all in an effort to get a little ahead of the curve on this idiotic race towards fifty thousand words by the end of the month.

Knowing I can knock out over fifteen hundred words an hour when I put my mind to it makes the task seem somewhat easier - except of course the words have to make at least a little sense. I have to keep telling myself to just write - get the words down - don't re-read and start tinkering. I never proof-read blog posts, so it makes little difference.

Anyway. Just thought I would drop in and say hello.

And yes, I know I said I was going to do NaNoWriMo as a series of long blog posts, but I decided against it. I'm writing "The Book of Me" - kind of a tour of anything and anything I'm interested in, along with huge swathes of life story. I thought it might be rather cathartic, and would require little or no imagination - just a good memory.

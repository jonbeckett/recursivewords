Recursive Words is the personal blog of Jonathan Beckett (me) - software and web developer, husband, father, cat wrangler, some-time runner, and player of far too many retro video games.

I live in deepest, darkest England â€“ land of good manners, punctuation, starched shirts and silent indignation. I grew up near Oxford and now live in the countryside just outside London.

I have been writing a personal blog for over twenty years.

I write about anything and everything on a fairly regular basis - or at least try to - following Norah Ephron's somewhat famous maxim about blogs being "sort of like an exhale" - that whatever you are saying only really needs to be true for as long as you are saying it - even if it's not much.

When not writing blog posts, bashing my head against the desk repeatedly (I work from home), sitting in conference calls pretending to be clever, or attempting to survive living in a house with four women and two cats, I can sometimes be found trudging around town in running shoes.

What else is there to say?

I like pizza, wine, chocolate, coffee, cult movies, and most music (lets ignore thrash metal and rap).

I will admit to being a somewhat accidental Swiftie.

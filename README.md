This is an experiment (for now).

For years, I have kept a well maintained backup of my blog in markdown format - plain text files - hidden away in a source code repository.

While updating it recently, it occurred to me that it wouldn't take much effort to make a Jekyll version of it (which is essentially markdown with some front-matter).

I don't know if I'll ever wire it up to a domain name properly, but it's an interesting diversion.

The real version of the blog lives at https://recursivewords.substack.com (for now).
